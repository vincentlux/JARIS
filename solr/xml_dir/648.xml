<field name="content">PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR EXTRAFOVEOLAR CHOROIDAL OSTEOMA.,&quot;The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of systemic antiparasitic medications alone or in combination with surgical aspiration in management of presumed trematode-induced anterior uveitis in children. Prospective case series. Children who presented with anterior chamber (AC) granuloma were included in the study. All patients received antiparasitic treatment and after 2 weeks; patients were divided based on their clinical improvement in terms of the baseline granuloma area into two groups: group A (&lt;2.5mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) who continued on antiparasitic medications only (n=15) and group B (2.5mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) who underwent surgical aspiration (n=15). Basic demographics data, visual acuity (VA), corneal thickness, granuloma area and AC activity (cells and flare) were recorded and analysed. Systemic work-up including stool and urine analysis, full blood count, chest X-ray and schistosomiasis titre were performed. Thirty eyes of 30 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 13.42.42 years. All patients were male. Patients were examined and followed at Mansoura Ophthalmic Center, Mansoura University. Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in VA, AC activity, corneal thickness and granuloma area (p-value&lt;0.001), which was achieved with medical treatment only in group A. However, in group B granuloma required aspiration and did not recur after that. Presumed trematode-induced AC granuloma is common among children living in the rural areas of Egypt. Antiparasitic medication alone was found to be effective for small-sized granulomas. Surgical aspiration is an effective adjuvant procedure to treat large-sized ones. &quot;</field>
