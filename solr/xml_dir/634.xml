<field name="content">Remission Of Non-Infectious Anterior Scleritis: Incidence And Predictive Factors.,&quot;Myopia is a refractive error of the eye caused by a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The aim of this study was to investigate whether environmental risk factors can influence the genetic effect in children developing myopia. A total of 3422 children participating in the birth-cohort study Generation R underwent an extensive eye examination at 9years with measurements of refractive error and axial length corneal radius ratio (AL/CR). Environmental risk factors were evaluated using a questionnaire, and environmental risk scores (ERS) were calculated using backward regression analyses. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated based on all currently known risk variants for myopia. Gene-environment interaction (GE) was investigated using linear and logistic regression analyses. The predictive value of GE and parental myopia was estimated using receiver operating characteristic curves. Myopia prevalence was 12%. Both GRS (P&lt;0.01) and ERS (P&lt;0.01) were significantly associated with myopia and AL/CR, as was GE interaction (P&lt;0.01 for myopia; P=0.07 for AL/CR). The predictive value of parental myopia was 0.67 (95% CI 0.65-0.70), similar to the values of GRS (0.67; 95% CI 0.64-0.70; P=0.98) and ERS (0.69; 95% CI 0.66-0.72; P=0.98). Adding GE interaction significantly improved the predictive value to 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.75; P&lt;0.01). This study provides evidence that nature and nurture are equally important for myopia and AL/CR; however, the combination has the strongest influence. Since myopia genes are common in the population, adjustment of lifestyleshould be a major focus in the prevention of myopia. &quot;</field>
