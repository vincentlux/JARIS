<field name="content">miR-29a/b cluster suppresses high glucose-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells by targeting Notch2.,&quot;Western blot analysis is widely used for detecting protein expression, analysis of protein-protein interactions, and searching for new biomarkers. Also, it is a diagnostic tool used for detection of human diseases and microorganism infections.Some Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins are important virulence factors and a few of them are diagnostic markers. Here, we describe the detection of two pneumococcal proteins, pneumolysin and PpmA, in human urine by using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. &quot;</field>
