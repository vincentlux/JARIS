<field name="content">&quot;Insidious-onset, non-wheezing carteolol-induced asthma in an atopic patient without asthma history.&quot;,&quot;Idiopathic paediatric uveitis (IPU) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis (JIA-U) are the two most common entities in paediatric uveitis. This study addressed the possible association of IPU and JIA-U with genes that had been shown earlier to be associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We carried out a case-control association study involving 286 IPU, 134 JIA-U patients and 743 healthy individuals. A total of 84 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 60 genes were selected for this study. The MassARRAY platform and iPLEX Gold Genotyping Assay was used to genotype 83 candidate SNPs and the remaining SNP (rs27293) was analysed using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. No evidence was found for an association of the candidate polymorphisms tested with IPU. Six SNPs (PRM1/rs11074967, JAZF1/rs73300638, IRF5/rs2004640, MEFV/rs224217, PSMA3/rs2348071 and PTPN2/rs7234029) showed an association with JIA-U (p&lt;1.010&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). Our findings showed associations of six SNPs (PRM1/rs11074967, JAZF1/rs73300638, IRF5/rs2004640, MEFV/rs224217, PSMA3/rs2348071 and PTPN2/rs7234029) with JIA-U. No association was detected between the 84 tested SNPs and IPU. &quot;</field>
