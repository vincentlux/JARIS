<field name="content">Fulminant Hepatitis Associated With Echovirus 25 During Treatment With Ocrelizumab for Multiple Sclerosis.,&quot;To investigate the features of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on optical coherence tomography in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration with subretinal drusenoid deposit. We classified the eyes into three types: nonundulating RPE, undulating RPE, and wedge-shaped RPE. We compared the retinal vessel densities, retinal thickness, and choroidal thickness of a 3-mm-diameter zone. We classified 33, 27, and 20 as nonundulating RPE, undulating RPE, and wedge-shaped RPE eyes, respectively. The vascular densities of the superficial and deep capillary plexus showed differences; nonundulating RPE group (23.93  2.26% and 23.54  1.78%), undulating RPE group (22.29  2.80% and 21.94  2.42%), and wedge-shaped RPE group (21.93  2.70% and 20.63  2.42%, P = 0.010 and P &lt; 0.001). The mean retinal thickness and choroidal thickness were also different, nonundulating RPE group (298.26  13.81 m and 180.08  55.49 m), undulating RPE group (285.29  21.88 m and 148.45  55.08 m), and wedge-shaped RPE group (274.86  20.62 m and 135.75  39.77 m) (P = 0.001 and P = 0.007). Altered features of the RPE on optical coherence tomography may indicate advancement in disease and be part of an overall degeneration process in these eyes. &quot;</field>
