<field name="content">Phenomenological tissue fracture modeling for an Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery training system based on experimental data.,&quot;The ideal simulator for Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery (ESSS) training must be supported by a physical model and provide repetitive behavior in a controlled environment. Development of realistic tissue models is a key part of ESSS virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation. Considerable research has been conducted to address haptic or force feedback and propose a phenomenological tissue fracture model for sino-nasal tissue during surgical tool indentation. Mechanical properties of specific sino-nasal regions of the sheep head have been studied in various indentation and relaxation experiments. Tool insertion at different indentation rates into coronal orbital floor (COF) tissue is modeled as a sequence of three events: deformation, fracture, and cutting. The behavior in the deformation phase can be characterized using a non-linear, rate-dependent modified Kelvin-Voigt model. A non-linear model for tissue behavior prior to the fracture point is presented. The overall model shows a non-positive dependency of maximum force on tool indentation rate, which indicates faster tool insertion velocity decreases the maximum final fracture force. The tissue cutting phase has been modeled to characterize the force necessary to slice through the COF. The proposed model in this study can help develop VR-based ESSS base simulators in otolaryngology and ophthalmology surgeries. Such simulators are useful in preoperative planning, accurate surgical simulation, intelligent robotic assistance, and treatment applications. &quot;</field>
