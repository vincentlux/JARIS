<field name="content">Assessment of Automated Identification of Phases in Videos of Cataract Surgery Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.,&quot;Surgical face masks are worn by theatre staff to protect the surgical site from airborne contamination and the wearer from bodily fluid splash. This observational/audit aimed to assess whether theatre staff wear masks in accordance with manufacturers&apos;/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines of use. A total of 1034 surgically scrubbed staff were assessed on their technique of applying surgical face masks, compared to the CDC guidelines as manufacturers&apos; guidelines were not available as per Health and Safety Executive guidelines. Only 18% of surgically scrubbed staff fully complied with the CDC guidelines on the application of a face mask. Compliance was worst in urology, ophthalmology and vascular surgeons, whereas orthopaedic and plastic surgeons were the most compliant. Compliance with CDC face mask guidelines may have an impact on surgical site infections (SSI) and protection of staff from body fluid splash, but most staff do not comply with these guidelines. Most operating theatre staff do not apply a face mask using correct technique, outlined in CDC guidance, which may increase SSI rates. Staff are not aware of existing guidelines for donning a mask. &quot;</field>
