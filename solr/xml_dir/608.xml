<field name="content">Monocanalicular Stents in Eyelid Lacerations A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.,&quot;Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides encompass a diverse spectrum of autoimmune diseases characterized by necrotizing small vessel vasculitis. Ocular manifestations may be the presenting findings of antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides. Single, retrospective case study. We report the rare case of a 55-year-old woman with a cilioretinal artery occlusion as the presenting feature of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated microscopic polyangiitis. Although rare, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-related vasculitis should be considered in any retinal vascular occlusion, particularly in the setting of patients with new vague headaches and a paucity of vasculopathic risk factors. &quot;</field>
