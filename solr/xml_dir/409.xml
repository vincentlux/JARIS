<field name="content">Management of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma in a child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,&quot;Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) treated with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) can have abnormal visual functioning that may be missed by Snellen visual acuity alone. We investigated reading deficits in patients treated with PRP for PDR using the Minnesota reading (MNREAD) test. Thirty patients treated with PRP and 15 controls underwent best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the MNREAD, frequency doubling perimetry (FDP), and fundus photography. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)-treated subjects were compared to controls on MNREAD results by two-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon tests and Pearson correlations were used to assess the association between performance on MNREAD and other central visual function tests within PRP subjects. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)-treated patients had reduced MNREAD acuity (p&lt;0.0001) and increased critical print size (p=0.01) compared to controls but not a significantly reduced maximum reading speed (p=0.06). Logmar MNREAD acuity was strongly positive correlated with logMAR BCVA (r=0.58, p=0.0098) and strongly negatively correlated with FDP foveal threshold (r=-0.63, p=0.0030). Maximum reading speed was positively correlated with FDP foveal threshold (r=0.57, p=0.0143) and FDP mean deviation (r=0.51, p=0.0432). Visual acuity did not correlate with the sensitivities on the FDP. The MNREAD test reveals that PRP reduces reading ability and other aspects of macular function, and thus provides new understanding of how vision-related quality of life is impaired. These findings may lead to improved means to evaluate and enhance vision following treatment for PDR. &quot;</field>
