<field name="content">Comparison of Toric and Spherical Orthokeratology Lenses in Patients with Astigmatism.,&quot;We systematically compare the intermodality and interreader agreement in age-related macular degeneration(AMD)-associated neovascularization assessment for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images obtained using different slabs. We collected data from 48 patients (50 eyes) with type 1 or 2 neovascularization (NV) and AMD. Subjects were imaged with a swept source (SS)-OCTA system. For each eye, three OCTA en face images generated from three different slabs were exported: (1) the outer retina to choriocapillaris (ORCC) image, (2) the choriocapillaris (CC) image, and (3) the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-RPE fit image. Each image was graded by two readers to assess interreader variability and a single image for each modality was used to assess the intermodality variability. In the assessment of type 1 NV, mean absolute interreader difference between measured NV areas was 0.19, 0.30, and 0.16 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; for ORCC, CC, and RPE-RPE fit images, respectively. Similarly, the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) indicated that the RPE-RPE fit assessment was characterized by the highest interreader reproducibility. Type 1 NV size was 0.58 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.30-1.60 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on ORCC images, 0.00 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.00-0.36 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on CC images (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.002 vs. ORCC), and 0.62 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (0.31-2.03 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) on RPE-RPE fit images (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.0001 vs. CC, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; = 0.041 vs. ORCC). The RPE-RPE fit OCTA images have the highest interreader agreement and deliver larger measurements in type 1 lesions. OCTA imaging may be used in ongoing trials of potential novel treatments for NV. &quot;</field>
