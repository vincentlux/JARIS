<field name="content">Surgical Outcomes of Intraconal Cavernous Venous Malformation According to Their Location in Four Right-Angled Sectors.,&quot;To report the epidemiology and clinical features of viral anterior uveitis in patients in southern Taiwan. A retrospective, case series study. HLA-B27 negative anterior uveitis patients with increased intraocular pressure or corneal edema seen at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 1, 2007 to January 31, 2018 had their aqueous sent for polymerase chain reaction analysis. Their records were reviewed for demographic data, ocular findings, and laboratory results. In the aqueous samples obtained from 102 eligible eyes, 42 eyes were herpesviridae-positive, which included 9 with herpes simplex virus (8.8%), 5 with varicella-zoster virus (4.9%), 27 with cytomegalovirus (26.5%), and 1 with Epstein-Barr virus (1%). Herpesviridae-positive patients were more likely to be male, and have glaucoma. Glaucoma and pseudophakic eyes were significantly associated with CMV-positive eyes. PCR analysis of the anterior chamber fluid is important for the confirmation of the diagnosis of viral anterior uveitis. Cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis is not uncommon in patients in southern Taiwan, and it may follow an uneventful cataract extraction in immunocompetent patients. &quot;</field>
