<field name="content">Diagnostic conundrum of periorbital vascular lesions: from the unexpected to the typical.,&quot;Aerobic exercise is associated with the sympathetic activation evoking adaptive responses to sustain muscle engagement. Physical exercise can cause alterations in the cardiovascular activity and cellular stress may occur which could be marked by either heart rate (HR), or galvanic skin response (GSR). Moderate plasma levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered as health markers, absolving to important roles such as adaptive cellular responses to exercise. Orexin A, a hypothalamic peptide, causes a widespread stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, playing a role in many physiological functions. &quot;</field>
