<field name="content">Comparative transcriptome analysis of human conjunctiva between normal and conjunctivochalasis persons by RNA sequencing.,&quot;To screen &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt; in 187 families with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Sanger sequencing and/or targeted exome sequencing was employed to identify mutations in the &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt; gene, and intrafamilial cosegregation analysis if DNA was available. In silico analyses and splicing assay were used to evaluate the variants&apos; pathogenicity. Genetic analysis revealed 15 mutations in &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt; in 14 pedigrees, including one splice-site mutation, one frameshift mutation, three nonsense mutations, and ten missense mutations. Of the mutations identified in &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt;, seven are novel associated with LCA, including five missense variants (c.124C&gt;T, c.149T&gt;C, c.340A&gt;C, c.425A&gt;G, and c.1399C&gt;G) and two indel (insertions or deletions) variants (c.858+1delG and c.1181_1182insT). In vitro splicing assay was performed to evaluate the functional impact on RNA splicing of novel mutations if two of three in silico analyses were predicated to be non-pathogenic at the protein level. Among these 15 variants, 14 were classified as &apos;pathogenic variants,&apos; and a variant (c.124C&gt;T) was &apos;variants with uncertain significance&apos; according to the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Mutations in &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt; were responsible for 11 of the cohort of 187 Chinese families with LCA, which expands the spectrum of &lt;i&gt;RPE65&lt;/i&gt;-related LCA in the Chinese population and potentially facilitates its clinical implementation. &quot;</field>
