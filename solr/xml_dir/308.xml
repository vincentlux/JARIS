<field name="content">Sensorimotor Control in Dystonia.,&quot;To describe the clinical and histopathological features of an aggressive ciliary body adenocarcinoma with pulmonary metastases and skull base spread. A 45-year-old female patient presented with a post-traumatic phthisical eye that was eviscerated. This showed an unexpected carcinoma (positive for cytokeratins and melanocytic markers), the histological differential diagnosis for which included a primary ciliary body adenocarcinoma or a metastasis. The patient developed rapid post-surgical localized recurrence that required an orbital exenteration. This showed identical tumour to the evisceration specimen, with vascular invasion in orbital blood vessels and a contaminated orbital soft tissue margin. Staging imaging revealed multiple lung metastases, which were biopsied and shown to be a disseminated ciliary body adenocarcinoma rather than a disseminated primary lung carcinoma. The tumour spread locally to the skull base for which radiotherapy was given. Unfortunately, the patient passed away a few weeks later. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ciliary body adenocarcinoma with bilateral lung metastases. The malignant potential of these tumours should be considered as a possibility, and appropriate screening and staging tests should therefore be considered to guide appropriate management. &quot;</field>
