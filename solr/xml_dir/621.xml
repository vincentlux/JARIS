<field name="content">Generating retinal flow maps from structural optical coherence tomography with artificial intelligence.,&quot;Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, when used during telemedicine eye screening alongside nonmydriatic fundus photography, were shown to improve the likelihood of accurate glaucoma and glaucoma-related diagnoses at the follow-up eye examination. To determine if IOP measurements, used as an adjunct to nonmydriatic fundus photography, are useful in glaucoma telemedicine screening. A total of 902 high-risk individuals were screened for glaucoma at 7 primary care practices and 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers using telemedicine. Screening at visit 1 included fundus photography, assessing family history of glaucoma, and IOP measurements using a hand-held rebound tonometer. Participants with suspicious nerve findings for glaucoma, IOP&gt;21mmHg or other ocular pathologies were invited for a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist (visit 2). Of the 902 individuals screened at visit 1, 19.6% (n=177/902) had elevated IOP (&gt;21mmHg). Fifteen participants were found to have an IOP&gt;30mmHg at visit 1, including 2 with an IOP of &gt;40mmHg. Among all who attended visit 2 (n=347), 10.9% had glaucoma and 7.2% had ocular hypertension. For participants having both suspicious nerve findings and IOP&gt;21mmHg compared with those with neither, the odds ratio (OR) of being diagnosed with glaucoma was 4.48 (95% CI, 1.50-13.93; P=0.007), whereas for participants with suspicious discs and IOP21mmHg the OR was 2.04 (95% CI, 0.83-5.53; P=0.15). In this telemedicine vision screening setting, having a higher IOP at the screening visit increased the likelihood of receiving a final diagnosis of glaucoma. Therefore, this study supports incorporating IOP measurements, using a portable tonometer, into vision screening programs in high-risk populations. &quot;</field>
