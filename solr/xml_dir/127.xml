<field name="content">&quot;Visual Function Questionnaire as an outcome measure for homonymous hemianopia: subscales and supplementary questions, analysis from the VISION trial.&quot;,&quot;Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis has previously almost exclusively been reported in Asians and in dermatological journals. In this report, we present a case of a young black South African male referred to our eye clinic. A 15-year-old male patient presented with gradual, painless loss of vision in his right eye. Clinical examination revealed a port wine stain with ocular involvement on the right as well as a nevus of Ota. Fundoscopy on the right revealed an advanced glaucomatous optic disc and raised intra-ocular pressure. A diagnosis of glaucoma associated with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis was made. We present the first case of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis in an African male with associated glaucoma seen at our tertiary hospital. &quot;</field>
