<field name="content">Endothelin-1 Concentration in Aqueous Humor Predicts Postoperative Late Low Intraocular Pressure in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma After Trabeculectomy.,&quot;To report the clinical course and outcomes of adjunctive dexamethasone implants in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and retinal detachment (RD) undergoing vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade. This retrospective, interventional case series included AD patients with RD and various degrees of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) who were scheduled to undergo vitrectomy. Following total vitrectomy and retinopexy, silicone oil tamponade was performed. Finally, an intraocular dexamethasone implant was injected intravitreally. Anatomical and functional outcomes were assessed at 12months, and extended follow-up data were also collected. Seven eyes from six patients (five male, one female) were included. The median age was 29 (range, 20-38) years. Preoperatively, six eyes were pseudophakic, two eyes had a history of previous vitreoretinal surgery, and one had uveitis. Postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity improved in two eyes, worsened in one, and remained similar in four. Retinal attachment was maintained in all eyes at 12months. The major complication was an increase in postoperative intraocular pressure in six eyes, requiring either medical or surgical treatment. During the extended follow-up period (15-37months), retinas remained attached in all eyes and stable visual acuity was maintained in five. Injection of an intraoperative dexamethasone implant to silicone oil-filled eyes appears tolerable and may be beneficial in the surgical management of AD patients with RD and PVR. &quot;</field>
