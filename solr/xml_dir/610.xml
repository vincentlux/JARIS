<field name="content">Gene expression profile of extraocular muscles following resection strabismus surgery.,&quot;To assess the prevalence and associations of small hard drusen in a child cohort. Cross-sectional study of 11- to 12-year-old Danish children from the population-based Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 Eye Study. Fovea-centered, 45 color images of both eyes were graded for macular drusen (within one optic-disc-rim-to-fovea distance of the foveal center) and for extramacular drusen. Analyses tested for associations between drusen and anthropometric measures including choroidal thickness. Gradable fundus images from both eyes were available for 1333 children (640 boys, 693 girls) with a mean (SD) age of 11.7 (0.40) years. One or more small hard macular drusen (diameter &lt;63 m) were present in 82 (6.2%) right eyes and 82 (6.2%) left eyes and in 147 (11.0%) subjects. Four children (0.30%) had 20 or more small hard macular drusen in one or both eyes. Extramacular small hard drusen were present in 10.7% of children, and 19% of children had such drusen anywhere. The odds for having one or more small hard macular drusen increased with subfoveal choroidal thickness with an odds ratio of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.28; P = 0.013) per 50-m thicker choroid, adjusted for age and sex. The association with choroidal thickness was also present for extramacular drusen. Having one or more small hard macular drusen was common in 11- to 12-year old children and it was associated with a thicker subfoveal choroid. Few children had many small hard drusen. There is no apparent clinical impact of small hard drusen in childhood. &quot;</field>
