<field name="content">Immunopathogenesis of Behcet&apos;s Disease.,&quot;To evaluate overall upper eyelid laxity according to age and sleep position. This single-center prospective study was conducted on healthy subjects between 20 and 89 years of age and was approved by the institutional review board and the ethics committee. Data collected were age, sex, weight and height, ophthalmological history, general history (diabetes, hypertension, smoking) and preferred sleep position (lateral, ventral, dorsal decubitus or no preference). Overall upper eyelid laxity was measured using the McNab technique. In total, 280 patients were included in the study - 40 per 10-year age bracket. Mean overall right eyelid laxity was measured at 5.35mm (5.38mm on the left) between 20 and 29 years old and 8.28mm (8.43mm on the left) between 80 and 89 years old. 161 patients slept in a lateral decubitus position. Median overall upper eyelid laxity for the sleep side was 8mm vs. 7mm for the non-sleep side. Overall upper eyelid laxity increased significantly with age (P&lt;0.001) and compared to the contralateral side (P&lt;0.001). Overall upper eyelid hyperlaxity can be defined as a measurement (by the McNab technique) greater than: 7mm between 20 and 29 years, 8mm between 30 and 39 years, 9mm between 40 and 69 years and 10mm between 70 and 89 years. This study provides new data on normal eyelid laxity in the general population according to age and sleep position. &quot;</field>
