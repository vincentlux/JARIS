<field name="content">Macular hyperpigmentary changes in &lt;i&gt;ABCA4&lt;/i&gt;-Stargardt disease.,&quot;The goal of this study was to assess changes in OCT parameters occurring in high myopic glaucoma patients, so as to enable early diagnosis and prevention of progressive glaucomatous damage. It was performed at the department of ophthalmology, Kasr Alainy Hospital, Cairo University, over a twenty-month period. This study was a cross-sectional randomized single blinded study. It included 62 eyes of highly myopic individuals. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A included myopic non-glaucomatous individuals, and Group B included the myopic glaucoma patients. All patients had a full ophthalmological examination, as well as OCT assessment of the RNFL, GCC and ONH parameters. The VF was tested as well as AXL and CCT. Correlation of the data was performed. Regarding the GLV, its mean in group A was 11.886.71% versus 19.699.69% in group B; the difference between both groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Regarding the cup area, the mean in group A was 0.510.41mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while that in group B was 1.250.72mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; the difference between both groups was statistically significant (P&lt;0.001). The ONH parameter, cup area, and the GCC parameter, GLV, are key parameters in supporting the diagnosis of glaucoma in myopic patients. Other parameters measured by OCT, such as inferior RNFL thickness, FLV, and C/D ratio, could aid in diagnosis as well. &quot;</field>
