<field name="content">Three de novo DDX3X variants associated with distinctive brain developmental abnormalities and brain tumor in intellectually disabled females.,&quot;Neurodegenerative diseases affecting the posterior segment of the eye are one of the major causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. The pathogenesis of these retinal pathologies is characterized by a multifactorial etiology, involving the complex interaction of different apoptotic mechanisms, suggesting that effective treatments will require a multimodal approach. Thus, combination therapy based on the potential synergistic activities of drugs with different mechanisms of action is currently receiving considerable attention. Here, we summarize several kinds of strategy for the co-administration of different drugs to the posterior segment of the eye, highlighting those that involve co-delivery from multiloaded drug delivery systems. &quot;</field>
