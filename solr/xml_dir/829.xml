<field name="content">Intralenticular Cilia Following Penetrating Ocular Trauma: A Case Report.,&quot;To evaluate the outcomes and complications of bilateral same-day intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. This is a single-center, retrospective study that included 524 eyes of 262 patients who received concomitant bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in 2016 at St. Michael&apos;s Hospital, Toronto. If any of the patients were receiving simultaneous bilateral injections on a regular basis prior to 2016, data pertaining to previous injections were also reviewed. Everyone received bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept in an office setting. A total of 9,798 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (4,899 bilateral injection sessions) were performed in 524 eyes of 262 patients. The average number of bilateral injection sessions per patient was 18.7  14.1. Ranibizumab was the most commonly used anti-VEGF drug (83.8%). The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.01%, and there were 2 episodes of acute intraocular inflammation among the 9,798 injections (0.02%). All 3 cases occurred after treatment with ranibizumab. There were 2 deaths (0.76%) due to nonvascular causes but no vascular related systemic adverse events were reported. Same-day bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections present a low rate of complications and are well tolerated by patients. This safe practice may reduce the burden on the health-care system and on the patients. &quot;</field>
