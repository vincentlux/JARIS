<field name="content">Differential stability of variant &lt;i&gt;OPN1LW&lt;/i&gt; gene transcripts in myopic patients.,&quot;To evaluate rod function longitudinally in intermediate age-related macular degeneration subjects with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and without RPD (AMD). Retinal sensitivities (505 and 625 nm) during dark adaptation, at 14 locations within the central 12 macula were obtained after photobleaching at baseline and 12-month visits. Pointwise sensitivity differences between both stimuli were used to assess static rod function, while rod intercept time (RIT) and rod recovery rate (RRR) were used to evaluate dynamic function. Changes in function over time were compared between groups. A total of 23 controls, 12 AMD, and 13 RPD cases were followed-up. At baseline, the RPD group had significantly worst static and dynamic rod function compared to AMD and control groups. Static function in AMD was similar to controls. Static and dynamic function across the central 12 was consistent in controls; however, it was most impaired at 4 compared to 12 eccentricity in disease groups. Over 12 months, no AMD cases progressed clinically and static function in AMD improved (P  0.04), but remained unchanged in control and RPD groups (P  0.17). The RRR for control and RPD groups remained stable, while the AMD group deteriorated, but only at 12 (P = 0.02). The RIT was stable in AMD (P = 0.75) and RPD (P = 0.71) groups but improved in the control group (P = 0.002). A decrease in RRR was detected over 12 months at 12 eccentricity in the AMD group. Evaluating changes in rod function requires testing at multiple locations including the peripheral macula. &quot;</field>
