<field name="content">Outcomes after Epiretinal Membrane Surgery with or Without Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling.,&quot;The purpose of the study was to describe findings demonstrated by anterior segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in various types of deeply embedded corneal foreign bodies. In this experimental study, an ex vivo model of calf eyes was used and seven different foreign bodies were deeply embedded in the cornea, consisting of five different materials: glass, plastic, metal, wood, and pencil graphite. The eyes were photographed and then scanned by AS-OCT. The images were analyzed to determine distinguishing characteristics for each material. Various materials presented unique characteristics in AS-OCT. The opaque materials (pencil graphite, metals, and wood) demonstrated a hyper-reflective anterior border, whereas the posterior border signal could not be clearly identified due to the shadowing effect. Moreover, a chain of signals was characteristic of both pencil graphite and metals though a &quot;&quot;mirroring effect&quot;&quot; was unique for metals. Wood, as an opaque material, appears as a hyper-reflective mass with a spectrum of penetrability depending on the degree of concentration. Transparent materials demonstrated hyper-reflective sharp borders when surrounded by air or fluid, as opposed to when being embedded purely in the corneal stroma. This study shows that AS-OCT was used to systematically define a novel set of distinguishing characteristics specific to various materials extruding from the cornea, fully embedded in the cornea, and intruding into the anterior chamber. Hopefully, the described characteristics of each material can aid clinicians in diagnosing the type of the material embedded and the depth of its involvement in ocular injury. &quot;</field>
