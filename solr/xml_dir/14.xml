<field name="content">&quot;Prone transradial catheterization for combined single-session endovascular and percutaneous interventions: approach, technical success, safety, and outcomes in 15 patients.&quot;,Ice-ball fracture is a rare and often overlooked entity that may lead to intraprocedural hemorrhage after percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses. There is scant literature on ice-ball fractures associated with percutaneous renal cryoablation. Immediate recognition of the &lt;i&gt;lightning bolt&lt;/i&gt; sign during intraprocedural computed tomography can help identify patients who may have developed this complication.</field>
