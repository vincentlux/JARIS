<field name="content">Age-associated changes in human tear proteome.,&quot;To explore the pathogenesis that TIMP-1 mediated in adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease (AOXGD), a rare type of non-Langerhans histiocytosis that damages the appearance and quality of life of patients Methods: We reviewed 22 patients diagnosed with AOXGD based on clinical manifestations and histological analysis, and then investigated the expression of TIMP-1 and IL-6 with q-PCR and IHC in AOXGD tissues and the possible mechanism involved in the induction of TIMP-1 by IL-6. IL-6 and TIMP-1 were significantly increased in AOXGD tissues. IL-6 promoted TIMP-1 production by M1 macrophages by stimulating the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Moreover, IL-17 and IFN-, the classical markers of Th1 and Th17 cells, were increased in AOXGD. These data implied that the IL6~JAK2/STAT3-TIMP-1 signalling pathway is activated in AOXGD and that adaptive Th1 and Th17 responses are involved in the development of AOXGD. &quot;</field>
