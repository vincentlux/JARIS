<field name="content">Reply.,&quot;To investigate to what extent the OSDI can be utilized as a discriminative test for clinical findings. One thousand and ninety patients with dry eye disease (DED) were consecutively included and examined for osmolarity, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), ocular protection index (OPI), ocular surface staining (OSS), Schirmer I test (ST), meibum expressibility (ME), meibum quality (MQ) and diagnosis of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis considering optimum balanced sensitivity and specificity (close to 50%) was used for assessment. The present study on more than 1,000 patients indicates that the OSDI in the ROC curve analysis is a poor discriminator of pathological scores for TFBUT  5 (AUC = 0.553; p = 0.012) and  10 s (AUC = 0.608; p = 0.002), OSS  3 (AUC = 0.54; p = 0.043), ST  5 (AUC = 0.550; p = 0.032) and  10 mm/5 min (AUC = 0.544; p = 0.016), and ME  1 (AUC = 0.594; p = &lt;0.001). Pathological scores for osmolarity &gt; 308 and &gt; 316 mOsm/L, OPI, OSS &gt; 1, MQ and MGD could not be discriminated by OSDI (p &gt; 0.05). Cut-off values for the OSDI can be defined to discriminate pathological TFBUT ( 5 and  10), OSS ( 3), ST ( 5 and  10) and ME, however, the discriminability was low. Our comprehensive study emphasises the importance of taking both symptoms and signs into account in DED management. &quot;</field>
