<field name="content">High-functioning autism spectrum disorder with fluent speech and late-onset epilepsy: an unusual presentation of Inv-Dup (15) syndrome.,&quot;To describe the clinical and Anterior Segment Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-SS OCT) findings in Bilateral Acute Depigmentation of the Iris (BADI). Retrospective descriptive study of three clinical cases. Three women diagnosed with BADI shared a history of bacterial infections treated with moxifloxacin. The AS-SS OCT showed damage from the collarette to the root of the iris, without affecting the pupillary area. In the affected areas, the anterior edge had lost its homogeneous hyper-reflectivity. The stroma was thinned and showed a patchy and diffused hyper-reflectivity. The pigmentary epithelium appeared unaffected. AS-SS OCT findings, not previously described, locate the damage in BADI in the anterior edge and iridian stroma, areas which are rich in melanocytes and permeable to aqueous humor. &quot;</field>
