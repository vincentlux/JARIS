<field name="content">Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of A Novel 0.05% Cyclosporin A Topical Nanoemulsion in Primary Sjgren&apos;s Syndrome Dry Eye.,&quot;Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new technology of angiography which features multiple advantages over the traditional ones. It can provide a rapid and noninvasive approach to observing the vascular morphology and blood vessel density of the optic disc, peripapillary and macular area. Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an acute optic neuropathy characterized by a sudden, painless decrease in vision and a typical visual field defect. It has been widely accepted that the circulatory insufficiency of the optic nerve head (ONH) mainly supplied by the posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) results in ischemic damage. Relevant researches are necessary for exploring the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of NAION, and this review summarizes the results of recent studies on application of OCTA in analyzing the blood flow in the optic and macular area in NAION patients. &lt;i&gt;(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55:306-310)&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;</field>
