<field name="content">Bipolar Cell Type-Specific Expression and Conductance of Alpha-7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Mouse Retina.,&quot;Electroretinograms (ERGs) elicited by high temporal frequency (26-95Hz) L- and M-cone isolating sine-wave stimuli were investigated in human observers for full-field (FF) and different spatially restricted stimulus sizes (70, 50, 30, and 10 diameter). Responses to L- and M-cone isolating FF stimuli were maximal around 48Hz and decreased gradually with increasing temporal frequency up to 95Hz. The response maximum was shifted to about 30-32Hz for both L- and M-cone driven responses obtained with spatially restricted stimuli. The M-cone driven responses could only be measured up to 54Hz with 70 stimuli. The response amplitudes for L- and M-cones and L-/M-cone amplitude ratios decreased with decreasing stimulus size. The ERG response phases to L- and M-cone isolating stimuli decreased with increasing temporal frequency and were about -160 apart for all stimulus sizes up to 34Hz. Further increase in the temporal frequency displayed a positive correlation between stimulus size and L-M phase difference. The ERG data indicate that the responses evoked by high temporal frequency cone isolating stimuli reflect two mechanisms, one that is more centrally located and displays a maximum at about 30-32Hz and a peripheral mechanism that is sensitive to higher temporal modulations. We propose that the peripheral mechanism (FF ERGs) reflects magnocellular activity, whereas the central mechanism (ERGs with spatially restricted stimuli) is based on a parvocellular activity up to about 30Hz. &quot;</field>
