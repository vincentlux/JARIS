<field name="content">Visual and optical quality outcomes of SMILE and FS-LASIK for myopia in the very early phase after surgery.,&quot;The maturation state of dendritic cell (DC) plays an important role in immune activities. Previously we had found that NF-B (p65) pathway could promote DC maturation and subsequent immune effects. But the upstream mechanism of this pathway was still unclear. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activating its receptor P2X7R has recently been considered as the fourth signal to activate T lymphocytes. Here we aimed to find out the connection between P2X7R and NF-B (p65) pathway in DC maturation. Results showed that the expression of P2X7R and the intracellular ATP levels were increased along with the maturation of DC. P2X7R agonist stimulated the morphological changes of DCs into the appearance of mature DCs, and promoted the expression of NF-B (p65), as well as the release of IFN- and IL-12. Whereas, P2X7R inhibitor had the opposite influences. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of P2X7R and NF-B (p65). Our study suggested that extracellular ATP could promote DC maturation and release of inflammatory cytokines through the binding of P2X7R and NF-B (p65). This is the first study to show the P2X7R-NF-B (p65) pathway in DC. Interference with this pathway may be able to regulate immune responses in areas like infectious diseases, inflammation, transplantation, tumor and autoimmune diseases. In addition, intracellular ATP level could be a new indicator of the maturation state of DC. &quot;</field>
