<field name="content">&quot;Protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis of clinical outcomes following accelerated versus conventional corneal collagen cross-linking for corneal ectasia.&quot;,&quot;Very recent research results have demonstrated that the &quot;&quot;Rostock Artificial Eye Collection&quot;&quot; - assembled 150 years ago with 132 glass modelled exhibits of anterior segment pathologies - is mainly based on the figures of the Atlas of Ophthalmology published by Antoine Pierre Demours in 1818. This article focusses on the analyses of the imaging techniques of this atlas. Present knowledge implies that the author used different colour etching concepts which were partially re-coloured individually. In the opinion of contemporaries, the figures of Demours\&apos; atlas represent the climax of scientific imaging techniques. In the academic literature, it is still described as a &quot;&quot;recent remarkable masterpiece&quot;&quot;, even 100 years later. &quot;</field>
