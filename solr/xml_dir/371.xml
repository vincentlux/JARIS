<field name="content">Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with orbital involvement.,&quot;Preterm infants are often exposed to both antenatal and postnatal glucocorticoids (GCs). We tested the hypothesis that combined antenatal and postnatal GCs have long-lasting adverse effects on fetal and neonatal growth, growth factors, and neurological outcomes. Pregnant rats were administered a single IM dose of betamethasone (0.2 mg/Kg, AB), dexamethasone (0.2 mg/Kg, AD), or equivalent volumes of saline (AS) at 17 &amp; 18 days gestation. Following delivery, pups from each treatment group were sacrificed at P0, and the remainder was treated with a single IM dose of either betamethasone (0.25 mg/Kg, PB), dexamethasone (0.25 mg/Kg, PD), or equivalent volumes of saline (PS) on P5, P6, and P7. Somatic growth, neurological status, and growth factors were determined at P14, P21, and P45. At birth, AD resulted in decreased somatic growth. AB advanced the hopping reflex associated with spinal rhythmic mechanisms. At P21, all GC groups were growth suppressed, but only the AS/PD group had deficits in brain weight and delayed plantar reflex associated with brainstem function. By P45, sustained reductions in body and brain weight occurred all combined antenatal and postnatal GC groups, as well as elevated ACTH and corticosterone. Retardation in plantar reflex occurred in all AD groups. IGF-I, GH and insulin levels were elevated at all ages with dexamethasone. Combined antenatal and postnatal GCs has persistent detrimental lasting effects on growth, growth factors, neurological outcomes, and HPA axis activity. Whether these effects persist in adult life and are risk factors for insulin resistance, remains to be elucidated. &quot;</field>
