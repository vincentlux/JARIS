<field name="content">Commentary on: Rehabilitation of the Dysmorphic Lower Eyelid From Hyaluronic Acid Filler: What to Do After a Good Periocular Treatment Goes Bad.,&quot;The aim was to determine the relationship between bulbar conjunctival microcirculation and retinal microcirculation in a healthy population. A functional slit-lamp biomicroscope (FSLB) was used to measure blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood flow rate (BFR) in the conjunctiva while a retinal function imager (RFI) was used to measure macular BFV and BFR in the retina. One eye of each subject of 58 self-reported healthy subjects was imaged in the same session on the same day. The mean BFV in the venules of the conjunctiva was 0.490.13mm/s, which was significantly slower than that in the retinal arterioles (3.710.78mm/s, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) and retinal venules (2.980.58mm/s, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). The BFR in the conjunctiva (0.09nl/s) was also significantly lower than that in the retina (arterioles=0.81nl/s, venules=0.68nl/s, all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). The BFVs and BFRs were not related between the conjunctiva and retina (r ranged from -0.17 to -0.05, all &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&gt;0.05). The microcirculation in the retina appeared to be different from that in the conjunctiva. &quot;</field>
