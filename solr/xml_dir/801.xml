<field name="content">Quantification of Visual Fixation in Multiple Sclerosis.,&quot;To report anatomical and visual outcomes of Nd:YAG laser posterior hyaloidotomy (NYPH) in Saudi patients affected by Premacular subhyaloid haemorrhage (PMSHH). 8 eyes from 8 patients (7 males and one female) were treated with NYPH when no spontaneous resolution of PMSHH was noticed. The cause of PMSHH was proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 3 cases, Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in 2 cases, Valsalva retinopathy in 2 cases, and laser pointer injury in one case. The YAG laser was delivered using a Q switched mode and 3 mirrors contact lens. One attempt of laser delivery was enough in 6 cases and 2 cases needed 2 attempts. The laser power needed ranged between 2 and 4mJ. Anatomical success was achieved in all cases. The mean LogMAR VA improved from 1.5 before treatment to 0.3 post-treatment. The difference is statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;=0.012). No complications related to Nd:YAG laser therapy was reported in any of the study cases until the last follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the outcomes of NYPH for non-resolving PMSHH in Saudi cases. In this small cases series, the procedure seems to be safe, effective, simple, cheap, and non-invasive treatment modality for this disorder that is conducted in the outpatient setting. We think it should be considered as a first option for cases of SHH covering the fovea due to various aetiologies. &quot;</field>
