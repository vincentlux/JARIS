<field name="content">Diagnosis and surgical management of orbital sparganosis.,&quot;To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in a rat model of corneal alkali injury. Corneal alkali injury was produced by placing an NaOH-soaked filter paper disk on the central cornea of the right eye of an anesthetized male Lewis (LEW/Crl) rat. Recombinant human TSG-6, or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), was administered intravenously (IV), by anterior chamber (AC) injection, or as a topical drop. The affected eyes were photographed daily using a dissecting microscope and documented for clinical time course analysis of corneal opacification. Corneal tissue was excised at pre-determined therapeutic endpoints, with subsequent qRT-PCR or histological analyses. The continuous monitoring of corneal alkali injury progression revealed TSG-6 treatments do not show sufficient effectiveness in vivo regardless of IV injection, AC injection, or topical application. Corneal opacification and neovascularization were not diminished, and gene expression was not impacted by these treatments. However, both IV and AC administration of TSG-6 significantly suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to PBS-treated eyes. We conclude that the therapeutic potential of TSG-6 is insufficient in a rat corneal alkali injury model. &quot;</field>
