<field name="content">Anatomical and functional changes in neovascular AMD in remission: comparison of fibrocellular and fibrovascular phenotypes.,&quot;Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common manifestation of inherited retinal diseases with high degree of genetic, allelic, and phenotypic heterogeneity. CEP250 encodes the C-Nap1 protein and has been associated with various retinal phenotypes. Here, we report the identification of a mutation (c.562C&gt;T, p.R188*) in the CEP250 in a consanguineous family with nonsyndromic RP. To gain insights into the molecular pathomechanism underlying CEP250 defects and the functional relevance of CEP250 variants in humans, we conducted a functional characterization of CEP250 variant using a novel Cep250 knockin mouse line. Remarkably, the disruption of Cep250 resulted in severe impairment of retinal function and significant retinal morphological alterations. The homozygous knockin mice showed significantly reduced retinal thickness and ERG responses. This study not only broadens the spectrum of phenotypes associated with CEP250 mutations, but also, for the first time, elucidates the function of CEP250 in photoreceptors using a newly established animal model. &quot;</field>
