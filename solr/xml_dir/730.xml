<field name="content">&quot;Whole exome sequencing identified ARL2 as a novel candidate gene for MRCS (microcornea, rod-cone dystrophy, cataract, and posterior staphyloma) syndrome.&quot;,&quot;Systemic hyperuricemia (HyUA) in obesity/T2DM facilitated by elevated activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which is the sole source of uric acid (UA) in mammals, has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance/dyslipidemia in obesity. Here, the effects of hepatocyte-specific ablation of &lt;i&gt;Xdh&lt;/i&gt;, the gene encoding XOR (HXO) and whole-body pharmacologic inhibition of XOR (febuxostat) on obesity-induced insulin resistance/dyslipidemia were assessed. Deletion of hepatocyte &lt;i&gt;Xdh&lt;/i&gt; substantially lowered liver and plasma UA concentration. When exposed to an obesogenic diet, HXO and control &lt;i&gt;floxed&lt;/i&gt; (FLX) mice became equally obese, but systemic HyUA was absent in HXO mice. Despite this, obese HXO mice became as insulin resistant and dyslipidemic as obese FLX mice. Similarly, febuxostat dramatically lowered plasma and tissue UA and XOR activity in obese wildtype mice without altering obesity-associated insulin resistance/dyslipidemia. These data demonstrate that hepatocyte XOR activity is a critical determinant of systemic UA homeostasis, that deletion of hepatocyte &lt;i&gt;Xdh&lt;/i&gt; is sufficient to prevent systemic HyUA of obesity, and that neither prevention nor correction of HyUA improves insulin resistance/dyslipidemia in obesity. Thus, systemic HyUA, while clearly a biomarker of the metabolic abnormalities of obesity, does not appear to be causative. &quot;</field>
