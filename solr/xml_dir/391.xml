<field name="content">Secondary surgical intervention after primary glaucoma filtration surgery: an Ontario population-based study.,&quot;We aimed to compare the thickness of anterior sclera, corneal layers, and pre-ocular tear film between patients with primary Sjgren&apos;s syndrome and healthy individuals. Fifty-one patients with primary Sjgren&apos;s syndrome and 41 healthy control participants were recruited in this cross-sectional and comparative study. The thickness of the pre-ocular tear film, corneal epithelium, Bowman&apos;s layer, stroma, Descemet&apos;s membrane, and endothelium were measured on the corneal apex. Anterior scleral thickness was measured at distances of 1 mm and 3 mm from the limbus. The anterior segment module of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was used to measure thicknesses of pre-ocular tear film, corneal layers, and anterior sclera. Tear film thickness, Schirmer&apos;s test, and tear break up time values were significantly lower in the Sjgren&apos;s disease group than in the healthy controls (p&lt;0.05). The thickness measurements of corneal layers and sclera were similar between the groups. Tear film thickness was moderately correlated with the Schirmer&apos;s test results (r=0.34, p=0.001), but there was no correlation between the Schirmer&apos;s test results and tear break up time (r=0.18, p=0.09). Pre-ocular tear film, as measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, was thinner in patients with primary Sjgren&apos;s syndrome than in the healthy controls. The thicknesses of corneal layers and anterior sclera were similar between the groups. &quot;</field>
