<field name="content">miR-204-5p promotes diabetic retinopathy development via downregulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3.,&quot;Optical coherence tomography angiography (Angio-OCT) has introduced a new non-invasive, quantitative method to assess superficial and deep capillary networks of the retina. In this study, we investigated macular retinal thickness and flow density change following posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) surgery, using an RTVue XR Avanti Angio-OCT (A2016.2.0.35, Optovue, Fremont, CA), in patients with pathological myopia. A total of 13 patients with pathological myopia were recruited and all patients completed the 6 months follow-up visit. Data from 22 eyes were used in this study. The mean age was 36.2315.29 years, and 43% (n=6) were men. Spherical equivalent refractive error (SE) ranged from -8.0 to -24.0 D. Post-operative axial length, best-corrected visual acuity and SE did not change significantly at each follow-up, compared with preoperative measure (all P&gt;0.05). Postoperative flow density of superficial and deep retinal layers at each sector did not change significantly at each follow-up, compared to pre-operative measure (all P&gt;0.05). However, we found significant decrease in retinal thickness of parafovea-inferior sector after PSR surgery (P&lt;0.01), indicating potential relaxation of vitreofoveal traction after PSR surgery. &quot;</field>
