<field name="content">Response: Effects of Sex Hormones on Ocular Blood Flow and Intraocular Pressure in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: The Effect of Orgasm and Sexual Activity.,&quot;To evaluate the success rate and long-term motor and sensory outcomes of the full tendon vertical rectus transposition (VRT) with Foster suture for unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy. We reviewed the medical records of patients with unilateral acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy who underwent unilateral full tendon VRT with Foster suture between 2005 and 2016 and had a follow-up of 2 years. Data on pre- and postoperative diplopia, face turn, ocular deviation, and limitation of abduction were collected. A successful outcome was defined as a horizontal deviation 10 prism diopter (PD) of ortho in a primary position at distance and absence of diplopia. A total of 20 patients were included in this study. Median (IQR) preoperative deviation was esotropia 65 (40-130) PD, which improved to 10 (-4 to 45) PD postoperatively. Median (IQR) improvement of esotropia was 54 (30-76) PD (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). Median (IQR) preoperative limitation of abduction was -15 (-22.5 to 10; negative value means before reaching midline), which improved to 15 (7.5-45) pass midline postoperatively. Median (IQR) improvement of abduction deficit was 26 (15-35) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001). Successful surgical outcomes were obtained in eleven patients (55%). All patients in the non-successful group (n=9, 45%) had residual esotropia. Two of them underwent additional bilateral medial rectus recession. No postoperative vertical deviation or torsional diplopia was observed. In our series, the full tendon VRT with Foster suture in unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy resulted in significant improvement of the ocular alignment and range of abduction over the 2-year follow-up period. &quot;</field>
