<field name="content">MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AT THE ONSET OF EXUDATIVE CONVERSION IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.,&quot;Although goniotomy is known to be successful in treating congenital glaucoma, its effect in adult glaucoma patients remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of goniotomy performed simultaneously with cataract surgery in treatment of open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Retrospective comparative study. A total of 76 patients with moderately controlled OAG (intraocular pressure [IOP]21mmHg using medications) undergoing cataract surgery. Comparison of patients who underwent the conventional goniotomy during cataract surgery (combined goniotomy group) with those who underwent cataract surgery alone (phaco group). Changes in IOP and medications, and complications through 12months. Baseline IOP was 18.22.4 mmHg in the combined goniotomy group and 17.41.9 mmHg in the phaco group; number of medications was 2.61.1 and 2.40.9, respectively (P&gt;0.05). The reduction in IOP and medication use from baseline in the combined goniotomy group was significantly greater at 12months compared to the phaco group (-3.12.9 mmHg vs -1.32.4mmHg and -1.20.9 vs -0.70.9, respectively, both P&lt;0.05). The success rate was 76.7% in the combined goniotomy group and 50.0% in the phaco group at 12months (P=0.021). No significant complication was observed in either group. Combined goniotomy and cataract surgery showed a significantly greater reduction in IOP and number of medications compared to cataract surgery alone at 1year after surgery, with similarly favourable safety profiles. &quot;</field>
