<field name="content">Assessment of Consistency Between Peer-Reviewed Publications and Clinical Trial Registries.,&quot;Several studies have previously reported that endothelial cells contributed to pathological fibrosis in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) through endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT); however, the precise mechanism of this interaction has not been completely elucidated. The present study investigated the expression of microRNA (miR)-29a/b cluster in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and examined its functional role in high glucose (HG)-induced EndMT. HRMECs were exposed to glucose at concentrations of 5, 15, 30 and 50 mM for 7 days and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence were conducted to determine the expression of genes associated with miR-29a/b and EndMT. A luciferase reporter gene assay was also performed to confirm the association between miR-29a/b and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 (Notch2). The expression levels of miR-29a/b, and endothelial markers vascular endothelial cadherin and cluster of differentiation 31 were decreased, whereas the expression levels of Notch2 and mesenchymal markers, including -smooth muscle actin, fibroblast-specific protein 1 (also named S100 calcium binding protein A4, S100A4), fibronectin and SNAI1 were increased in HRMECs under HG (30 nM) conditions. In addition, Notch2 was identified as a target of miR-29a and miR-29b. Overexpression of miR-29a/b downregulated the expression of Notch2 and subsequently suppressed HG-induced EndMT. Taken together, the results of the present study revealed that the miR-29/Notch2 signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of HG-induced EndMT, and may serve as a potential molecular target during fibrosis in PDR. &quot;</field>
