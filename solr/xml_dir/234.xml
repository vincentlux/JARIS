<field name="content">Interferon Alpha for Refractory Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema (Irvine-Gass Syndrome).,&quot;Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) is a rare macular disorder. The clinical diagnosis of AMN is difficult and complicated since the retinal symptoms of patients with AMN are usually unclear or untypical. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a reliable examination for imaging the retinal structure, which improved the insight of AMN in etiology and pathogenesis. This review summarizes and analyzes the recent clinical reports and research progress, in an effort to present a more accurate clinical recognition of AMN. &lt;i&gt;(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55:311-315)&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;</field>
