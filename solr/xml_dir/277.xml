<field name="content">[The status of the application of optical coherence tomography angiography in nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy].,&quot;Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and short-term adverse outcomes have long been recognized; however, survivors remain at risk of long-term complications. We investigated whether HDP is associated with the development of choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (CNV AMD). We identified 31,454 women who experienced HDP based on Utah birth certificates and 62,908 unexposed women matched 2:1 to the exposed. Risk of CNV AMD was estimated using Cox models. Women with HDP exhibited an 80% higher risk for early CNV AMD (age &lt; 70 y; 95%CI 1.23-2.58). Our findings may have implications forearlier CNV AMD screening and detection. &quot;</field>
