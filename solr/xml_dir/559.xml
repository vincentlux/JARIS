<field name="content">Abamectin induces apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting reactive oxygen species-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling in MGC803 cells.,&quot;An 83-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of abducens palsy. Brain MRA revealed arterial dolichoectasia of most cerebral vessels, including the basilar, internal carotid, and middle cerebral arteries. Abducens nerve palsy as a sole manifestation of diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia is unusual but may occur in diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia. &quot;</field>
