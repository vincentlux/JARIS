<field name="content">Cost-effectiveness analysis in a randomized trial of late in-the-bag intraocular lens dislocation surgery: repositioning versus exchange.,&quot;Interface engineering has been recognized as one of the most promising strategies for regulating the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, constructing well-defined nanointerfaces with efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a challenge. Herein, cross columnar NiTe nanoarrays supported on nickel foam are prepared. Subsequently, NiTe/NiS nanointerfaces are constructed by an ion-exchange process. Importantly, the electrocatalytic performance for the OER can be facilitated by coupling NiTe and NiS. As a result, NiTe/NiS shows excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of only 257 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; , and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; in 1.0 m KOH. The calculated and experimental results reveal that the strong electron interaction on nanointerfaces induces electronic structure modulation, which optimizes the binding energy of *OOH intermediates, thus improving the OER performance. &quot;</field>
