<field name="content">Eyes on New Product Development.,&quot;To describe a novel surgical technique to remove retained subfoveal perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL). After setting up for 23-G pars plana vitrectomy, a 38-G flexible-tip macular hydrodissection cannula connected to the automated viscous fluid infusion kit was used to create a small retinotomy approximately 700 m to 800 m inferior to the fovea and induce macular detachment involving the retained PFCL bubble. The flexible cannula was bent at its junction with the shaft and was carefully advanced through the same retinotomy into the subretinal space to access and directly aspirate the retained subfoveal PFCL bubble. Fluid-air exchange was then performed, and surgery was concluded. The retained subfoveal PFCL bubble was successfully removed with restoration of normal foveal architecture on optical coherence tomography and with objective and subjective improvement of central vision. We report a novel surgical technique combining macular detachment with direct aspiration of the retained subfoveal PFCL without direct perforation of the foveal center. This technique may provide an alternative approach to manage this difficult complication. &quot;</field>
