<field name="content">Biotherapeutics and immunogenicity: ophthalmic perspective.,&quot;The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pupil cerclage and a new variant of sliding knot technique for repairing traumatic mydriasis. This is a observational case series study. A series of consecutive patients affected by traumatic permanent mydriasis who underwent pupil cerclage were recruited at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Padova, Italy. Best-corrected visual acuity, measured in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), and intraocular pressure at 1, 3, 6, and 12months were monitored. Postoperative pupil size and anterior chamber angle were measured. Postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME) and glaucoma were evaluated. Twelve patients were recruited. Phakic patients (7) underwent cataract surgery combined with pupil cerclage. Vitrectomy was performed in nine patients. Best-corrected visual acuity improved from 2.91.1 logMAR at baseline to 0.30.8 logMAR at 12th month. No significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure was demonstrated. Mean pupil size at 12th month was 2.820.5mm with round shape. Anterior chamber angle mean was 474.5. Six patients developed a CME, and two patients a glaucoma. Pupil cerclage technique reestablishes the pupil with a precise regulation of the pupil size without distortion of its natural round shape. New sliding knot allows surgeon to reduce the risk of iatrogenic iris damage and to make a security permanent knot. &quot;</field>
