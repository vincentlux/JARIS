<field name="content">Influence of Posterior Subcapsular Cataract on Structural OCT and OCT Angiography Vessel Density Measurements in the Peripapillary Retina.,&quot;Synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss are prominent features in Alzheimer&apos;s disease. Members of the Rho-family of guanosine triphosphatases, specifically RhoA, and the synaptic protein Arc are implicated in these pathogenic processes. They share a common regulatory molecule, the E3 ligase Ube3A/E6-AP. Here, we show that Ube3A is reduced in an Alzheimer&apos;s disease mouse model, Tg2576 mouse, which overexpresses human APP695 carrying the Swedish mutation, and accumulates A in the brain. Depletion of Ube3A precedes the age-dependent behavioral deficits and loss of dendritic spines in these mice, and results from a decrease in solubility following phosphorylation by c-Abl, after A exposure. Loss of Ube3A triggers the accumulation of Arc and Ephexin-5, driving internalization of GluR1, and activation of RhoA, respectively, culminating in pruning of synapses, which is blocked by restoring Ube3A. Taken together, our results place Ube3A as a critical player in Alzheimer&apos;s disease pathogenesis, and as a potential therapeutic target. &quot;</field>
