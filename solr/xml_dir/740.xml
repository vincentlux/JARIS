<field name="content">Anterior Segment Biometry with Phenylephrine and Tropicamide during Accommodation Imaged with Ultralong Scan Depth Optical Coherence Tomography.,&quot;To obtain the opinion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus about the use of antimalarials through questionnaires and to evaluate their adherence to medication. A cross-sectional study of patients treated with antimalarial medication for a period equal to or longer than 1year attended between November 2012 and October 2014. A structured questionnaire with 12 questions was filled out. Among 300 patients examined, 92% (275) used medication regularly. Hydroxychloroquine was used by 55% (166) of patients, chloroquine by 25% (75), and 20% (59) reported using both medications at different moments. Most of the patients (221 or 74%) were using medication sevendays a week and had taken it for a period longer than 5years; 61% (182) considered the treatment good and said, 21% (63) said, &apos;It is good, but I&apos;m afraid of taking it&apos;. Most of the patients (70% or 211) did not report any adverse symptoms. Their main claim was related to blurred vision, which was solved by a refraction examination. Fear has been a factor that makes adherence to treatment difficult. Making patients aware of the importance of the treatment is strongly relevant because antimalarials are well tolerated. &quot;</field>
