<field name="content">[Clinical features and genetic analysis of a pedigree affected with non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 gene related disease].,&quot;We thank Dr del Giudice&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; for his interest in our recent article in Clinical and Experimental Dermatology.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Our review encompassed the topic of oral ulceration as a manifestation of secondary syphilis and provided by way of example the case histories of two patients. While we agree that the lesions shown in Fig. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; are raised above the mucosal surface and are in their view &apos;vegetating&apos;, we described the lesions as &apos;mucous patches&apos;. When we biopsied a mucous patch, as shown in Fig. &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; , there was a discontinuous epithelium consistent with an ulcer. Thus, whether or not the lesion is described as a mucous patch or vegetating lesion, we have demonstrated ulceration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. &quot;</field>
