<field name="content">&quot;Endometriosis of the Eyelid, an Extraordinary Extra-abdominal Location Highlighting the Spectrum of Disease.&quot;,&quot;Penetrating ocular trauma is one of the most important causes of vision loss, especially in men, and can be associated with intraocular foreign bodies. The incidence of intraocular cilia after trauma is very low. Here we report the case of a 24-year-old man who visited Poostchi Ophthalmology Clinic (Shiraz, Iran) due to a gradual vision loss in his left eye over the past 2 months. The probable cause was a foreign object (metal splinter) in the eye as a result of hammering metal on metal. An examination revealed the site of a 2-mm sealed corneal laceration, localized central cataract with intralenticular cilia, and moderate anterior reaction. The patient underwent foreign body removal, lensectomy, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. One day after the operation, the visual acuity of the patient was 20/20. The intraocular cilia may have various clinical presentations; however, there is no report of a case with cilium embedded in the lens without any sight-threatening complications other than localized cataract and a moderate inflammatory reaction. Timely management and operation allow such patients to maintain a good vision. &quot;</field>
