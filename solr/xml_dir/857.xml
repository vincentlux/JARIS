<field name="content">Analysis of X-ray scattering microstructure data for implementation in numerical simulations of ocular biomechanical behaviour.,&quot;The suprachoroidal space (SCS) has been a successful target to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. We present the results of 4 patients who underwent a novel glaucoma surgical procedure to lower IOP: Intrascleral Ciliary Sulcus-Suprachoroidal Microtube. A sterile medical grade silicone microtube (Tube extender, New World Medical) was surgically placed to drain aqueous from the posterior chamber ciliary sulcus of the eye to the SCS. The internal diameter of the tube was 300 um and the length varied from 8-10mm. After informed consent was obtained and witnessed, this procedure was performed in glaucoma patients with pseudophakia. The tube was placed intrasclerally beneath an inferotemporal sclera flap (50% thickness approximately 4mm x 4mm). The anterior end of the tube was inserted into the ciliary sulcus approximately 2mm from the limbus and the posterior end was placed into the SCS approximately 4mm from the limbus. The microtube was sutured to the sclera with a 10-0 nylon suture. 8-0 vicryl sutures were used to close the sclera flap and the conjunctiva inferotemporally. All 4 patients had lower IOP. The average reduction of IOP was 36% at 3 months. The amount of glaucoma medications per patient at 3 months dropped from an average of 3 to 0.25. The risks are similar to traditional glaucoma incisional surgery. This new technique of Intrascleral Ciliary Sulcus-Suprachoroidal Microtube in all four patients with mild, moderate, and advanced glaucoma demonstrated a significant lowering of IOP and a decrease in the number of medications. Further research is required to assess long term efficacy and safety. &quot;</field>
