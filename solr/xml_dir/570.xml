<field name="content">&quot;Ophthalmic, systemic, and genetic characteristics of patients with Wolfram syndrome.&quot;,&quot;To describe the development and resolution of corneal edema in 3 patients who were exposed to compounds that stimulate dopaminergic pathways. We conducted a review of the literature on bilateral corneal edema secondary to amantadine use and report a case series of corneal edema seen in an outpatient ophthalmology specialty clinic, shortly after exposure to agents that enhance dopamine transmission. Cases 1 and 2 report a 25-year-old man with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a 73-year-old man with Parkinson disease who were placed on dopaminergic medications to treat their conditions. The former was administered methylphenidate and the latter patient was administered ropinirole. Both patients developed corneal edema soon afterward. Case 3 is a 67-year-old man with a recent exposure to resin from Euphorbia resinifera, a cactus in his garden. After cessation of the offending medications and treatment for exposure to resiniferatoxin, the corneal edema progressively resolved and visual acuity returned to baseline in all 3 cases. Methylphenidate, ropinirole, and resiniferatoxin have different mechanisms of actions but have a common end point leading to increased dopamine. We believe that these agents are linked with the reversible corneal edema seen in our 3 patients. This strongly correlates with previous studies that have linked amantadine, a drug that blocks dopamine reuptake, to reversible corneal edema. &quot;</field>
