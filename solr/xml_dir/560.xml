<field name="content">Membrane assembly of aquaporin-4 autoantibodies regulates classical complement activation in neuromyelitis optica.,&quot;To report the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Retrospective, multicenter chart review of patients diagnosed with peripapillary CNVM in the course of the treatment and follow-up of IIH. Records were reviewed from 7 different institutions between 2006 and 2016. Ten patients (13 eyes) with a diagnosis of IIH and at least 3 months of follow-up developed CNVM. Three of the total 10 patients developed bilateral CNVM. The mean time from the diagnosis of IIH to CNVM diagnosis was 41 months. Mean follow-up period was 8 months after diagnosis of CNVM. All patients were treated with acetazolamide for IIH. Seven eyes were observed, and 6 eyes were given anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept. All CNVMs regressed with subretinal fibrosis, and visual acuity improved in most patients. Papilledema resolved in only 1 eye, while the other 12 eyes had persistent papilledema at last follow-up. Peripapillary CNVM, a rare complication of IIH, often resolves spontaneously with treatment of IIH. In vision-threatening and/or persistent cases, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment may be a safe and effective therapeutic option. &quot;</field>
