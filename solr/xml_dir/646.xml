<field name="content">Management of Peripapillary Choroidal Neovascular Membrane in Patients With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.,&quot;Direct closure (DC) of eyelid defects has been retrospectively shown to give excellent outcomes. We present prospective outcome data as further evidence to promote its wider use. A consecutive, unselected, series of patients undergoing eyelid tumour resection was studied prospectively. DC was attempted at the time of biopsy in all of them. If DC proved impossible, delayed reconstruction using other techniques was later performed. Defect size, pre- and post-operative palpebral aperture (PA) measurements and the final visit patients&apos; and surgeons&apos; satisfaction scores for function and appearance were recorded. Seventy-three eyelids of 70 patients were studied. Mean resected specimen width was 16.4mm (4-26mm) in the DC group, versus 23.9mm (11-42mm) for other, non-DC reconstructions. Primary DC was achieved in 74% of this cohort. Mean final post-operative PA measurements in the DC group were 0.7mm vertically (p=0.003) and 0.8mm horizontally (p=0.009) less than preoperatively, but there was no statistical difference (p=0.1) in the final horizontal measurements between the operated and un-operated sides in the DC group. DC satisfaction scores were excellent for both eyelid function and appearance. DC of eyelid defects, irrespective of per-operative PA distortion, gives excellent late post-operative outcomes. We recommend that DC, aligning the closure tension parallel to the lid margin, is attempted whenever wound margin approximation is possible in preference to alternative reconstruction techniques, regardless of any temporary PA distortion and globe displacement that this may cause. Eyelid function and appearance recover to near normal within 2 months. &quot;</field>
