<field name="content">&quot;Socio-economic status, visual impairment and the mediating role of lifestyles in developed rural areas of China.&quot;,&quot;To compare the cost-effectiveness of two operation methods for late in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation. In this randomized clinical trial, 104 patients were randomly assigned to IOL repositioning by scleral suturing (n=54) or IOL exchange with a retropupillary iris-claw lens (n=50). A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed in conjunction with previously published 6-month efficacy and safety results. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost difference between the operation groups relative to their difference in postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (mean and 95% confidence interval: minimum and maximum), reported as the cost difference in United States Dollars ($) per logMAR difference. Exchange surgery was $281.2017.66 more expensive than repositioning, mainly explained by the new IOL and the frequent use of anterior vitrectomy. A previous trial publication revealed no significant difference in the 6-month postoperative CDVA between the groups. In the CEA, the mean group difference yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -$281.20 per -0.11 logMAR (-$1108/QALY) in favour of repositioning, ranging from -$281.20 per -0.29 logMAR (-$406/QALY) in favour of repositioning to +$281.20 per -0.08 logMAR (+$1522/QALY) in favour of exchange. The CEA did not include the mean 9.5min shorter operation time for exchange. Repositioning tended to be more cost-effective than exchange; however, this is modified if also considering the operation time. Overall, it seems the cost-effectiveness is not alone sufficiently different to recommend one of the operation methods over the other for late in-the-bag IOL dislocation. &quot;</field>
