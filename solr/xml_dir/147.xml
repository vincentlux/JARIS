<field name="content">Longitudinal evaluation of visual function and structure for detection of subclinical Ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy.,&quot;The purpose of this study is to compare the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) between eyes of age-matched individuals with aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) and emmetropia. A prospective hospital-based case-control study in South India was conducted to study the CSF in the eyes of patients between the ages of 50-60 years. The CSF was compared between those with emmetropia and those implanted with an indigenous aspheric IOL. Twenty-five consecutive patients were recruited in both groups. The independent sample &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-test was used for analysis. The mean age was 53.08  1.96 years and 57.68  2.85 years in normal emmetropes and emmetropic pseudophakic with aspheric IOL, respectively. The mean CSF showed a statistically significant difference (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.000) between the normal emmetropic eyes and pseudophakic eyes with the values being 1.91 and 1.572, respectively. The CSF was significantly better in the eyes of age-matched normal emmetropes when compared to those with an aspheric IOL implanted. &quot;</field>
