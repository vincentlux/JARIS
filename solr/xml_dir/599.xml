<field name="content">Spatial intratumor heterogeneity in uveal melanoma: Tumor cell subtypes with a presumed invasive potential exhibit a particular epigenetic staining reaction.,&quot;Carteolol, a non-selective beta-antagonist with a potential risk of severe bronchial constriction in patients with asthma, is one of the most commonly prescribed medication for managing ocular pressure in glaucoma. We present a case of a 24-year-old woman with a history of atopy but no known asthma who presented an insidious onset of clinical manifestations compatible with drug-induced asthma after the initiation of carteolol for ocular hypertension control. The patient developed progressive chest tightness and dyspnoea for 2months before the pulmonary function test revealed a positive bronchoprovocation response. She reported significant improvement of respiratory symptoms within 2weeks after the discontinuation of carteolol, and a negative provocation response was later confirmed by repeat pulmonary function test. In conclusion, eye drops with non-selective beta-antagonising effect can induce asthmatic symptoms in patients without a previous diagnosis of asthma and should be administered with caution in patients with associated risk factors. &quot;</field>
