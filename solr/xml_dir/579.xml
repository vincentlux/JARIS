<field name="content">Comparison of Clinical Results and Pathological Examinations Between Locally Synthesized Bone-derived Hydroxyapatite and Medpor Orbital Implants in Animal Models.,&quot;The mechanisms underlying the finding of reduced child mortality in communities with biannual treatment with azithromycin remain unclear. We determined if there was a difference in morbidity in a cohort of children ages 1 to 36 months, residing in communities randomized to biannual treatment of pre-school age children with azithromycin or placebo. 30 villages in Kilosa Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive biannual treatment of all children ages 1 to 59 months with either azithromycin (20/mg/kg single dose) or placebo. Children who were age 1 to 35 months and participated in the baseline survey were enrolled in this cohort study and followed prospectively for two years. Children were monitored every six months for signs and symptoms of diarrheal disease, acute respiratory illness, and anemia. Mixed effect models that include age, time, treatment arm, and the interaction of treatment arm and time as independent predictors were used to evaluate differences between children by treatment assignment over time. There was no difference in rates of diarrhea, fever, or anemia by treatment arm at baseline and at all phases of follow up. The decline over time in reported cough was statistically significant in the children residing in the azithromycin communities, but not in the placebo communities. Once adjusting for clustering and age, the difference in decline between the two treatment arms was not significant, p=.09. A beneficial effect of azithromycin treatment on morbidity outcomes was not evident at six monthly surveys. &quot;</field>
