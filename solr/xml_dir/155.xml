<field name="content">DeepSignal: detecting DNA methylation state from Nanopore sequencing reads using deep-learning.,&quot;The purpose of this article is to compare optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). OCTA, ICGA and fluorescein angiography (FA) images of all enrolled patients were collected and compared. Abnormal areas were annotated on en face choriocapillaris OCTA and ICGA images and compared with each other. We found three main types of anomalies in choriocapillaris OCTA images: type A, coarse granulated high reflective area (61 eyes [92.4%]); type B, roundish dark halo around Type A (54 eyes [81.8%]); and type C, coarse granulated low reflective area (66 eyes [100%]). There were 54 eyes (81.8%) that exhibited all three types abnormalities, 7 (10.6%) had only type A and C abnormalities, and 5 (7.6%) had only type C abnormalities. The Mean JI of type A on OCTA and hyperfluorescence area on ICGA was 0.840.15 and 0.820.23 for grader 1 and 2, respectively. Type A area on OCTA had a statistically larger area than hyperfluorescence on ICGA (P=0.01 [paired t-test]). In summary, abnormalities were found on OCTA images of CSC. Coarse granulated high reflective area in OCTA corresponded well with the hyper-permeability area in ICGA in most of the eyes. &quot;</field>
