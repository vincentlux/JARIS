<field name="content">Maximum Temperature and Solar Radiation as Predictors of Bipolar Patient Admission in an Emergency Psychiatric Ward.,&quot;Hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) serves as a gasotransmitter in the regulation of organ development and maintenance of homeostasis in tissues. Its abnormal levels are associated with multiple human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, myocardial injury, and ophthalmic diseases. Excessive exposure to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S could lead to cellular toxicity, orchestrate pathological process, and increase the risk of various diseases. Interestingly, under physiological status, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S plays a critical role in maintaining cellular physiology and limiting damages to tissues. In mammalian species, the generation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), 3-mercapto-methylthio pyruvate aminotransferase (3MST) and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These enzymes are found inside the mammalian eyeballs at different locations. Their aberrant expression and the accumulation of substrates and intermediates can change the level of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S by orders of magnitude, causing abnormal structures or functions in the eyes. Detailed investigations have demonstrated that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donors&apos; administration could regulate intraocular pressure, protect retinal cells, inhibit oxidative stress and alleviate inflammation by modulating the function of intra or extracellular proteins in ocular tissues. Thus, several slow-releasing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S donors have been shown to be promising drugs for treating multiple diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological function of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S metabolism and its application in ophthalmic diseases. &quot;</field>
