<field name="content">Bladder filling to promote subperitoneal hydrodissection during percutaneous thermal ablation of parietal abdominal tumor.,"An increasing interest in percutaneous ablation of renal tumors has been caused by the increasing incidence of SRMs, the trend toward minimally invasive nephron-sparing treatments and the rapid development of local ablative technologies. In the era of shared decision making, patient preference for non-invasive treatments also leads to an increasing demand for image-guided ablation. Although some guidelines still reserve ablation for poor surgical candidates, indications may soon expand as evidence for the use of the two most validated local ablative techniques, cryoablation (CA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is accumulating. Due to the collaboration between experts in the field in biomedical engineering, urologists, interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists, the improvements in ablation technologies have been evolving rapidly in the last decades, resulting in some new emerging types of ablations. A literature search was conducted to identify original research articles investigating the clinical outcomes of new emerging technologies, percutaneous MWA, percutaneous IRE and SABR, in patients with primary cT1 localized renal cell cancer. Due to the collaboration between experts in the field in biomedical engineering, urologists, interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists, the improvements in ablation technologies have been evolving rapidly in the last decades. New emerging technologies such as microwave ablation (MWA), irreversible electroporation (IRE) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) seem to be getting ready for prime time. This topical paper describes the new emerging technologies for cT1 localized renal cell cancer and investigates how they compare to CA and RFA."
