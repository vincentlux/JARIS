<field name="content">Photodynamic therapy: A hot topic in dermato-oncology.,&quot;The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of clinically significant anterior chamber inflammation in a combined surgery, namely, phacoemulsification and Ex-Press miniature glaucoma device implantation, compared to phacoemulsification alone. A retrospective comparative study of a consecutive series of 210 participants above 18years of age diagnosed with significant cataract and who required glaucoma surgery, namely, Ex-Press miniature glaucoma device implantation or cataract alone in one or both eyes. All were operated on by a single experienced glaucoma surgeon in a single medical center. A total of 231 eyes were included in this study. All cases underwent an uneventful surgery and were examined the day following the surgery for visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and signs of excessive anterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature grading3). The combined group included 55 eyes of 51 patients, of whom 15 (27.3%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. The phacoemulsification group included 176 eyes of 159 patients, of whom 12 (6.7%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The Ex-Press glaucoma device is efficient, safe, and known for its inert nature. However, combination of this procedure with phacoemulsification surgery might result in a condition encouraging excessive inflammation, which eventually could lead to excessive anterior chamber inflammations if not treated vigorously. Emphasizing and recognizing the risks, especially in glaucoma patients, is important. &quot;</field>
