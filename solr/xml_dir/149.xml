<field name="content">Repeatability of brown adipose tissue measurements on FDG PET/CT following a simple cooling procedure for BAT activation.,&quot;With the success of Descemet&apos;s stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) technique providing better outcomes in visual prognosis and theoretically lower rejection rate than penetrating keratoplasty, DSAEK dominated the realm of endothelial keratoplasty for the past decade. However, Descemet&apos;s membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) has become more and more popular worldwide due to its even lower rejection rate, faster visual recovery, better visual outcome, and lower long-term endothelial loss. In this article, we demonstrate the techniques and nuances of DMEK surgery in detail for corneal specialists who are beginning their DMEK surgeries. &quot;</field>
