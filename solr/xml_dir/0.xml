<field name="content">Adherence to Optical Safety Guidelines for Laser-Assisted Hair Removal.,&quot;In recent years, there was a rise in ocular injuries secondary to cosmetic laser-assisted hair removal. To assess the level of adherence to optical safety guidelines during laser-assisted hair removal performed by nurses or physicians in private practice. A cross-sectional study was conducted at thirty-one private laser-assisted hair removal clinics. An electronic random number generator using a cluster random sampling technique was used to select the clinics. The Alexlazr&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt; (Candela Corp., Wayland, MA, United States) device operator&apos;s manual checklist was modified to collect data from laser device operators and patients by surveying the laser rooms, interviewing the patients, and observing the treatments. Ninety-four patients treated by different service providers were included from 31 private centers. All treatment sessions were delivered by trained nurses. Only 9.5% had acceptable adherence to optical safety guidelines during hair removal treatment, while the majority (90.5%) of service providers were poorly adherent. None of the providers achieved excellent adherence to optical safety guidelines. The item with the least adherence was the lack of non-reflective floors inside laser rooms in 72.3% of centers. All service providers were familiar with the laser system controls and emergency shut down (100% adherence). There is a significant deficiency in the safety precautions at laser-assisted hair removal centers that can result in devastating ophthalmic injuries. Companies providing laser-assisted hair removal machines should be involved in aiding these centers to implement safety procedures. This article is protected by copyright.
