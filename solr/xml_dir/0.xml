<field name="content">Focal Ablative Therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma in Transplant Allograft Kidneys.,"To evaluate outcomes after focal ablative therapy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in transplant allograft kidneys METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients with a history of RCC in a transplanted allograft kidney who underwent focal ablative therapy were identified. Complete chart reviews were performed and the relevant data were extracted for cumulative analysis. Six patients were treated with focal ablative therapy for RCC in a transplanted allograft kidney at our institutional between 2010-2017. Masses were diagnosed at a median of 8 years (range 1 month-8 years) after transplantation. Median mass size was 3 cm. Three patients were treated with microwave ablation, one with percutaneous irreversible electroporation, one with laparoscopic cryoablation, and one with open cryoablation. Median follow up was 45 months (range 8-61 months). The median creatinine level was 1.65 before ablation and 1.58 one year after ablation. No patients required dialysis after ablation. No patients developed local recurrence during the follow up period. However, one patient developed lymph node metastases four years after ablation. Two patients died during follow up of other causes. At the time of death both patients had functioning grafts. Focal ablative therapies are a feasible, renal-sparing intervention for the management of RCC in renal allografts at intermediate-term follow up."
