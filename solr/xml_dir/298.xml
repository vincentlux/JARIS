<field name="content">Upregulated VEGF and Robo4 correlate with the reduction of miR-15a in the development of diabetic retinopathy.,&quot;Spontaneous resolution of myopic retinoschisis is an unusual event due to the fact that most eyes of patients with this condition have already undergone certain morphological changes and vision will progressively worsen over time. We present a case of spontaneous anatomic and visual improvement in a myopic eye with a macular retinoschisis. The patient was monocular oculus dextrus (OD) with a history of left eye enucleation for recurrent retinal detachment and glaucoma for 30 years prior. Recent optical coherence tomography (OCT) depicted features characteristic of myopic retinoschisis. At the same time, the patient sough chiropractic treatment for neck pain and numbness in upper limbs. The patient had received 12 sessions of cervical adjustment which helped attain symptomatic relief of her neck and upper limb complaints at which time the patient also reported substantial recovery in her vision. Restoration of the normal retinal morphological appearance was illustrated upon re-evaluation of OCT. Spontaneous resolution of myopic retinoschisis may be a multifactorial cause. Further studies elucidating the exact mechanism resulting in visual improvement after chiropractic adjustment are needed before any claims regarding its efficacy for the treatment of myopic retinoschisis can be made. &quot;</field>
