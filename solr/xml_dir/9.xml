<field name="content">Reply.,&quot;Adult strabismus is often characterized by surgical complexity. In recent years, several innovative techniques for the management of complex strabismus have been developed. Strabismus surgeons should understand the indications for various strabismus surgical techniques in the management of these difficult cases. This workshop describes several new surgical techniques to manage complex strabismus, including small-angle incomitant and very large-angle strabismus, torsional diplopia, and restrictive, paralytic, and secondary strabismus. Because strabismus surgery is an ever-evolving field, it is important to continue to refine our surgical armamentarium. Strabismus surgeons may wish to add these techniques to their surgical repertoire for select cases. &quot;</field>
