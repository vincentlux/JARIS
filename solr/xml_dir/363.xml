<field name="content">&quot;Evaluation of intraocular pressure and retinal nerve fiber layer, retinal ganglion cell, central macular thickness, and choroidal thickness using optical coherence tomography in obese children and healthy controls.&quot;,&quot;To assess the efficacy of an endothelial keratoplasty procedure at defined intervals to 1year postoperatively for the treatment of corneal endothelial dystrophy (CED) in a canine patient. A dog diagnosed with CED with progressive corneal edema underwent an endothelial keratoplasty. The patient was examined pre- and postoperatively with slit lamp biomicroscopy and ultrasonic pachymetry. Mean central corneal thickness (CCT) measured with pachymetry was &gt;1400m preoperatively and decreased postoperatively to 725m. The transplanted donor tissue became transparent 2weeks postoperatively and incorporated with the recipient cornea. The graft remained transparent throughout the duration of the postoperative period evaluated in this study (2weeks postoperatively to 1year). The canine patient was comfortable pre- and postoperatively. Endothelial keratoplasty is a potential therapeutic option for canine cases with progressive corneal thickening due to CED. As this is a single case study, further investigation into the use of endothelial keratoplasty to treat CED is warranted. Moreover, canine patients with CED might serve as a surgical model for human patients with Fuchs&apos; Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy. &quot;</field>
