<field name="content">Assessing Learning Needs and Career Attitudes of Italian Psychiatry Residents: Results from a National Survey Conducted by the Italian Society of Psychopathology Young Psychiatrists Section (SOPSI-GG).,&quot;We report an 8-year-old girl who experienced daily episodes of visual and somesthetic distortion and was diagnosed with Alice in wonderland syndrome (AIWS). Ophthalmologic assessment revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes, and bilateral constricted tubular or spiral visual fields. Augmented amplitude of visually evoked potentials was revealed, and treatment with lomerizine and valproate showed favorable effect on the visual/somesthetic distortion as well as the visual field and acuity. Psychogenic visual problems can co-exist with the typical sensory distortion in AIWS, similarly to the case of psychogenic pseudo-seizures in subjects with epilepsy. Otherwise, an ambiguous borderline between psychological and physical pathomechanisms in migraine may also be characteristic of the migraine-related AIWS. &quot;</field>
