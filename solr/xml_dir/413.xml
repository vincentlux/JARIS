<field name="content">Nailfold Capillaroscopy of Resting Peripheral Blood Flow in Exfoliation Glaucoma and Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma.,&quot;This issue of the European Journal of Neuroscience is dedicated to Rainer (Ray) Walter Guillery (28th August 1929-7th April 2017). Ray was an important, productive, and impactful neuroscientist and as such left an indelible mark on the field, both in terms of his direct contributions and also through his success at mentoring and nurturing young scholars who went on to successful careers of their own. He was also a great friend, colleague, and mentor to many of us. His work on the development of the visual pathways and thalamocortical organization left us with a classic foundation and legacy for these important areas of neuroscience.
