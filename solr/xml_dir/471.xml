<field name="content">Real-Life Evidence for Using a Treat-and-Extend Injection Regime for Patients with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.,&quot;With no safe and efficient approved therapy available for treating corneal neovascularization, the search for alternative and effective treatments is of great importance. Since the discovery of miRNAs as key regulators of gene expression, knowledge of their function in the eye has expanded continuously, facilitated by high throughput genomic tools such as microarrays and RNA sequencing. Recently, reports have emerged implicating miRNAs in pathological and developmental angiogenesis. This has led to the idea of targeting these regulatory molecules as a therapeutic approach for treating corneal neovascularization. With the growing volume of data generated from high throughput tools applied to study corneal neovascularization, we provide here a focused review of the known miRNAs related to corneal neovascularization, while presenting new experimental data and insights for future research and therapy development. &quot;</field>
