<field name="content">Characterization of the cryoablation-induced immune response in kidney cancer patients.,"To assess the feasibility of percutaneous magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided cryoablation of small renal masses (SRMs) in a 3-T environment and to evaluate intraprocedural imaging, procedural safety, and initial outcomes. The analysis included 9 patients (4 men; median age, 72 y; range, 70-82 y) with 9 SRMs (diameter, 12-30 mm). Lesions underwent biopsy, and cryoneedles were inserted under ultrasound guidance. Verification of needle positions and ice-ball monitoring were performed by T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination and T2-weighted half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences. On image analysis, needle positioning was considered appropriate if the target lesion border was visible, the needle tip was inside the target lesion, and the ice ball was expected to cover the target lesion with a 5-mm margin. If these criteria could not be assessed, imaging was considered inadequate. Technical success was defined as tumor coverage with a 5-mm margin and no residual disease on 1-mo follow-up MR imaging. Median total procedure time was 170 min (range, 135-193 min). Intraoperative imaging allowed adequate needle visualization in 67% of acquired scans (4 of 7 T1-weighted and 6 of 8 T2-weighted). Appropriate positioning of two or three needles used for each procedure was confirmed in all cases on T1- or T2-weighted imaging. Ice-ball formation was adequately visualized in all patients. Technical success rate was 100%. No local recurrences were detected on follow-up imaging at a median of 12 mo (range, 3-22 mo). Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation of SRMs in a 3-T MR imaging environment is safe and feasible, showing adequate intraoperative imaging capabilities with promising short-term clinical outcomes."
