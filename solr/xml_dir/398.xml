<field name="content">Use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in ophthalmology patients in Alberta.,&quot;Multiphoton microscopy allows long-term direct visualization of cells in live animals due to its low photodamage. When coupled with fluorescence protein targeting and second harmonic generation signals from natural collagen as contrast, multiphoton microscopy enables intravital tracing of cells while providing structural information from the extracellular matrix. Compared with conventional histological analysis, it can bring new insight into the cell dynamics in stem cell research. Here, we demonstrate cell imaging and tracing at a single cell resolution in the cornea, skin, and hair follicles using multiphoton microscopy in transgenic mice of which specific cell populations are tagged with fluorescent proteins. &quot;</field>
