<field name="content">How I do it: The Neuro-Ophthalmological Assessment in Parkinson&apos;s Disease.,&quot;This study aimed to evaluate potential risk factors for postoperative late low intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) after trabeculectomy. Adult patients who were diagnosed with POAG and scheduled to perform primary unilateral trabeculectomy in our hospital were consecutively included. Blood samples prior to the surgery and aqueous humor samples during the surgery of each participant were collected. Patient demographics, preoperative assessments, and laboratory tests were compared in patients with or without late low IOP. The risk factors for late low IOP were evaluated using logistic regression modeling. The predictive value of ET-1 in aqueous humor for late low IOP was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the total 222 enrolled patients, there were 39 cases of late low IOP with an incidence of 17.6% (39/222). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor was the only independent risk factor for late low IOP after trabeculectomy (OR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.79-0.98, P=0.021). ROC curve analysis showed that ET-1 concentration in aqueous humor was a predictor for late low IOP after trabeculectomy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.639, a specificity of 84.62% and a sensitivity of 39.89%, respectively (P=0.006). Our study indicated that ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor was an independent risk factor for late low IOP in POAG patients after trabeculectomy. &quot;</field>
