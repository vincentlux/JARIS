<field name="content">Safety Considerations and Local Tumor Control Following Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation of T1b Renal Tumors.,&quot;spine metastases are common concern from several primary neoplasms, modern management include percutaneous techniques such as ablation and cementoplasty. This research aims to evaluate the treatment under local anaesthesia in high-risk patients (ASA III). from January 2013 up to September 2016 we treated via percutaneous cryoablation 11 advanced oncological patients classified as ASA III, then retrospectively a review of their clinical history has been performed. Interventions were managed under local anaesthesia, injecting low doses of bupivacaine 2,5mg/ml (from10 to 30ml). Cryoprobes of 17G were introduced under CT guidance. VAS scores were evaluated pre, intra and post operative up to the 3rd month and further, statistical analyses were obtained using T student test. thirteen spinal metastases were cryoablated in 11 patients (6W, 5M; mean age of 53 years, range 52-81). Tumour location was: sacrum (n=6), lumbar spine (n=3), thoracic spine (n=2). The average VAS value during the procedure was 5,27 (standard deviation 0,90). There were statistically significant decreases in the median numeric VAS scale score at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month time points (P&lt;.001 for all). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Among patients with neurological deficit, some clinical improvement was assessed. cryoablation with or without subsequent cement injection can be safely performed with local anaesthesia for pain relief also in patients with high ASA score with higher risk of complications, in the absence of any other suitable treatment.&quot;</field>
