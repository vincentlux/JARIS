<field name="content">Five-year follow-up of secondary iris-claw intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of aphakia: Anterior chamber versus retropupillary implantation.,&quot;Glaucoma is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that causes impaired vision, and in advanced cases, blindness. The increasing prevalence of glaucoma due to an aging population has necessitated the identification of suitable biomarkers for the early detection of the disease. Aqueous humour (AH) has been proposed as a source of biomarkers, but it can only be collected using a minor, yet invasive surgical intervention. Tears, however, are constantly available and can be collected any time via non-invasive methods. In order to examine the utility of tear as a surrogate for aqueous humour in biomarker development, we compared the levels of 27 cytokines and chemokines in paired samples of tear and aqueous humour using a Luminex multiplex immunobead-based technique. Significantly higher levels of cytokines in tear compared to aqueous humour were detected suggesting that tear and aqueous humor are not identical in terms of inflammation response. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-, GM-CSF and IL-5 in tear were significantly lower in patients who developed complications after one year, but no statistically significant changes in cytokine levels were observed in aqueous humour. These three molecules may have potential as predictive biomarkers for the appearance of late flap-related complications of trabeculectomy. &quot;</field>
