<field name="content">The complimentary role of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and endobronchial ultrasound fine needle aspiration in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.,&quot;Cryoablation is one of treatment modalities for kidney cancer and is expected to induce strong local immune responses as well as systemic T-cell-mediated immune reactions that may lead to the regression of distant metastatic lesions. Thus, the characterization of T cell repertoire and immune environment in tumors before and after treatment should contribute to the better understanding of the cryoablation-induced anticancer immune responses. In this study, we collected tumor tissues from 22 kidney cancer patients, before cryoablation and at 3mo after cryoablation. In addition, blood samples were collected from 14 patients at the same time points. We applied a next generation sequencing approach to characterize T cell receptor  (TCRB) repertoires using RNAs isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TCRB repertoire analysis revealed the expansion of certain T cell clones in tumor tissues by cryoablation. We also found that proportions of abundant TCRB clonotypes (defined as clonotypes with  1% frequency among total TCRB reads) were significantly increased in the post-cryoablation tissue samples than those of pre-cryoablation tumor samples. Some of these TCRB clonotypes were found to be increased in peripheral blood. Expression analysis of immune-related genes in the tissues of pre- and post-cryoablation showed significantly elevated transcriptional levels of &lt;i&gt;CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; , &lt;i&gt;CD4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; , Granzyme A (&lt;i&gt;GZMA&lt;/i&gt;), and &lt;i&gt;CD11c&lt;/i&gt; along with a high &lt;i&gt;CD8/FOXP3&lt;/i&gt; ratio in the post-cryoablation tissue samples. Our findings revealed that cryoablation could induce strong immune reactions in tumors with oligoclonal expansion of antitumor T cells, which circulate systemically.&quot;</field>
