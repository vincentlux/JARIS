<field name="content">Brain Aging in Midlife: The Beaver Dam Offspring Study.,&quot;To determine the correlation between superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) and selected tear cytokines and to evaluate the efficacy of these cytokines in monitoring the response of patients with SLK to either medical treatment alone or in combination with conjunctival resection. A cohort study. Twenty-five eyes of 13 patients with SLK were assigned to either medically responsive or surgical treatment groups depending on their responses 1month after initial medical treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by improvements in clinical grading and decreases in the levels of tear cytokines. Fourteen eyes were improved by medical treatment alone, whereas satisfactory outcomes were achieved for the remaining 11 eyes after surgical management. The overall grading prior to medical treatment was lower in medically responsive group compared with surgical treatment group (p=0.0139). Among the examined tear cytokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was positively associated with the severity of clinical grading (p=0.0251). While both treatments significantly decreased the levels of MCP-1 and interleukin-6, surgical treatment also decreased the levels of interferon- and tumour necrosis factor-. Notably, overall cytokine levels after surgical treatment were lower than those after medical treatment alone. Since an association of tear MCP-1 level with the clinical grading and treatment response of SLK was observed in this study, tear MCP-1 may be a potential indicator of SLK disease severity. According to the degree to which the tear cytokine levels were decreased, surgical treatment appears to be an effective treatment modality for patients with SLK who are refractory to medical treatment alone. &quot;</field>
