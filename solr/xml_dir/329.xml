<field name="content">Macular Hole Formation after Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema.,&quot;The primary goal is to determine if the intraocular pressure reducing effect of generic Sandoz travoprost is equivalent to that of brand-name Travatan Z. The secondary goal is to determine if generic Sandoz travoprost is as well tolerated as Travatan Z. This prospective randomized crossover trial allocated 76 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, normotensive glaucoma, or ocular hypertension in a 1:1 ratio to start with either generic Sandoz travoprost or Travatan Z. Crossover happened after 3 weeks. The primary endpoint, intraocular pressure, was measured in both eyes at baseline, at week 3, and at week 6. The secondary endpoint was tolerability of both drugs as assessed by a questionnaire administered at week 3 and week 6. The intraocular pressure lowering effect of generic Sandoz travoprost was equivalent to that of Travatan Z (18.20  3.41 mmHg and 18.44  3.48 mmHg respectively, p &lt; 0.0001). Tolerability, as measured with a questionnaire, was similar between the two formulations of travoprost. This study is the first to compare a brand-name travoprost with one of its generic forms and adds to the body of evidence that generic glaucoma eye drops are as effective and well-tolerated as their brand name counterparts. The intraocular pressure lowering effect of generic Sandoz travoprost is equivalent to that of Travatan Z. Patient tolerance of generic and brand-name travoprost is similar. &quot;</field>
