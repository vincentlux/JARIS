<field name="content">Evaluation of ophthalmology clerkships across teaching sites at the University of British Columbia.,&quot;The evaluation of palpebral laxity can be performed by the distraction test (DT). Although widely used in ophthalmologic practice, there is no consensus about the results considered normal by the test. The objectives of this study are to obtain the value of DT in a group of individuals with healthy eyelids and to compare with the measurements in subjects with senile ectropion. Lower eyelid DT was performed in 200 individuals without any eyelid pathology and in 30 individuals with lower lid ectropion. The results were analyzed by age and sex in the control group and compared with the results of the ectropion group. The mean value of DT in the control group was 6.96 mm, lower than in the ectropion group (9.48 mm) (p &lt; 0.001). In the control group, the mean female DT was 6.70 mm, while the male was 7.22 mm. There were differences in the DT values in the subgroups of 20-39 and 40-59-year old according to gender, with men presenting higher measurements than women. In the other age subgroups, both genders presented similar DT values. Even when considering only individuals in the control group with the same range of age as in the ectropion group, the DT value was higher in individuals with ectropion (7.23 and 9.48 mm, respectively, p &lt; 0.001). The mean DT value is 6.96 mm; however, the measurement varies according to age and sex in people without palpebral pathology. Individuals with senile eyelid ectropion present higher measurements than healthy ones. &quot;</field>
