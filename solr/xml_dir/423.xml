<field name="content">The Retina in Alzheimer&apos;s Disease: Histomorphometric Analysis of an Ophthalmologic Biomarker.,&quot;The purpose of this article was to evaluate monocyte count and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and their ratio (monocyte/HDL ratio [MHR]) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). A total of 50 participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with BRVO and 25 participants as the control group. Ocular examination findings and hematologic parameters were accessed from the file records and database, retrospectively. The mean MHR was significantly higher in BRVO group compared to the control group (13.45.2 vs. 8.12.2, p &lt;0.001). In receiver operating characteristics analysis, the area under the curve for MHR was 0.862, and an MHR of &gt;9.5 predicted BRVO with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 70.8%. The present study showed that elevated MHR is significantly associated with BRVO. Therefore, MHR may be a useful marker for the emergence of BRVO. &quot;</field>
