<field name="content">A novel minimal fluid technique for effective and safe lens hydrodissection during cataract surgery.,&quot;To examine the incidence of intracapsular hemorrhage in orbital fracture repair with non-fixated nylon sheet implants. A retrospective chart review of 227 patients presenting from January 2013 to December 2016 for orbital fracture repair with nylon sheet implants. Of the 331 orbital fractures repaired over 4years, a total of 227 met inclusion criteria. The average implant thickness was 0.38mm and no implants were fixated. Four total implants (1.8%) were removed due to complications; one each secondary to exploration for ongoing postoperative diplopia, immediate post-operative orbital hemorrhage, a cystic mass anterior to the implant, and pain. There were no cases of intracapsular hemorrhage nor infection for any of the 227 patients over 4years. To the authors knowledge, this represents the largest case series to date to assess the rate of intracapsular hemorrhage in non-fixated nylon sheet orbital implants. In the 227 cases reviewed over a 4-year period, there were no cases of intracapsular hemorrhage. This suggests a much lower complication rate than previously reported.
