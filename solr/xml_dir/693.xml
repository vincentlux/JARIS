<field name="content">Evaluation of corneal elastic modulus based on Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology.,&quot;Cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings caused by trauma seriously influences visual function and causes blepharon deformities. The treatment of cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings is intractable. A 45-year-old male presented severe cicatricial conjunctival constriction ring due to traffic accident injury. This 5-mm diameter constriction ring resulted in the patient&apos;s eyelid deformities, including eyelid ptosis, ectropion, and visual obstruction. The patient underwent primary surgery of serial conjunctival Z-plasty for correction of the constriction ring. Conjunctival constriction ring was corrected immediately after Z-plasy. Fornix deepening suturing was adopted to promote formation of fornix and correct eyelid ectropion. A secondary surgery of frontalis flap suspension was adopted to correct ptosis 6 months after Z-plasty. The patient achieved a satisfactory and symmetrical appearance with no recurrence of cicatricial conjunctival constriction and no other complications during the 6-month follow-up period. In this patient, the authors claimed that serial Z-plasty surgery can effectively be used for correction of cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings. No further material implantation was applied during the operation. &quot;</field>
