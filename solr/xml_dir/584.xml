<field name="content">Nasal Polyposis: More than a Chronic Inflammatory Disorder-A Disease of Mechanical Dysfunction-The So Paulo Position.,&quot;To assess the association of Eph-receptor tyrosinekinase-type A2 (EphA2) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to age-related cataract (ARC) among ethnic Han Chinese from Hubei Province. 280 patients with cortical ARC and 200 healthy controls were recruited. Polymorphisms at four loci (rs3768293, rs3754334, rs477558 and rs7548209) of the EphA2 gene were detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RELP) assay. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of the two groups were compared. Compared with the control group, the AA genotype of rs3768293 locus was more common, while the AC genotype was much rarer (P&lt; 0.05). No significant difference was found in allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs3754334 locus between the two groups (P&gt; 0.05). The AA genotype of the rs477558 locus was more common in the patient group, while the AG genotype was much rarer (P&lt; 0.05). The genotype GG of the rs7548209 locus was more common in the patient group, while the CG genotype was rarer (P&lt; 0.05), though no significant difference in allelic or haplotypic frequencies between the two groups (P&gt; 0.05). Polymorphisms of rs477558, rs7548209 and rs3768293 loci of the EphA2 gene are associated with susceptibility to ARC among ethnic Han Chinese from Hubei province. &quot;</field>
