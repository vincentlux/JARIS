<field name="content">Weakly supervised lesion localization for age-related macular degeneration detection using optical coherence tomography images.,&quot;StrabisPIX is a smartphone application that allows clinicians to prescribe a series of self-obtained images of head position and eye alignment in nine positions of gaze that are uploaded onto a secure platform for clinician review. This study evaluates the clinical utility of this application. In this prospective, nonmasked, cross-sectional study, 30 strabismus patients aged 2 years were evaluated. Participants received standardized instructions, used StrabisPIX to obtain images as prompted, and completed a satisfaction survey. During the same visit, an orthoptist obtained standard clinical images with a professional camera. All 60 image sets were evaluated by three observers. StrabisPIX image quality was similar to that of clinic photographs. Clinic photographs had significantly higher acceptability for horizontal versions (81% vs. 67%), vertical versions (76% vs. 60%), and head posture (93% vs. 81%). Abnormalities were detected at a similar rate for versions, head posture, eyelid position, and pupil size. StrabisPIX had significantly higher detection of alignment abnormalities (89% vs. 77% for clinical photos). Interrater/intrarater agreements were moderate to high ( = 0.44-1.00) for all parameters except pupil abnormality, which had poor to fair agreement. Most patients reported that StrabisPIX was easy to learn and use. Overall, StrabisPIX images had similar quality and were as useful as images obtained in the clinic in detecting abnormalities. The StrabisPIX application will enhance the use of telemedicine by allowing physicians to prescribe self-obtained images documenting strabismus. &quot;</field>
