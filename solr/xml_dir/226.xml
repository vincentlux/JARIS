<field name="content">PHOTORECEPTOR DAMAGE IN DIABETIC CHOROIDOPATHY.,&quot;The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of Aflibercept and Ranibizumab in the treatment of naive diabetic macular edema (DME) with serous retinal detachment (SRD). In this prospective, non- randomized-cohort study, 60 eyes with DME with SRD were divided into two groups: group1 consisted of 30 eyes treated with intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg/0.1 mL Ranibizumab (IVR) and group2 consisted of 30 eyes treated with intravitreal injection of 2 mg/0.05 mL Aflibercept (IVA). After three sequential injections with 30-40 day interval as a loading dose, all patients were followed up for 12 months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), SRD&apos;height (SRDH) and the number of re-injections of the drugs were compared. The groups were similar in terms of age and sex (p&gt;0.05). There was no difference between groups in terms of the baseline BCVA, CMT and SRDH (p&gt;0.05). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to BCVA and CMT values for 12 month (p&gt;0.05). SRDH decreased significantly in both groups, however the reduction of SRDH was considerably higher in group 2 for 12 months (p&lt;0.05). The mean number of re-injection was 4.40  0.85 in group1 and 3.16  0.75 in group2 and it was noticeably lower in group 2 (p&lt;0.001). The number of cases with persistent SRD at the end of the study was 14 (46.6%) in group 1 and 5 (16.6%) in group 2 (p&lt;0.001). Aflibercept may treate SRD more efficiently in patients with DME compared to Ranibizumab with fewer injections. &quot;</field>
