<field name="content">&quot;The CCCTC binding factor, CTRL2, modulates heterochromatin deposition and the establishment of HSV-1 latency &lt;i&gt;in vivo&lt;/i&gt;.&quot;,&quot;To investigate the relation between high axial myopia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values. Seventy-nine cases were enrolled, 50 myopic and 29 emmetropic. All participants were assigned into three groups: Group I (high myopia with no retinal involvement), Group II (high myopia with retinal involvement) and Group III (control). NLR and PLR values calculated from blood tests were compared among the groups. Mean NLR levels were 2.230.78 in Group I, 2.361.06 in Group II, and 1.570.33 in Group III. Mean PLR levels were 114.6223.21 in Group I, 145.1652.36 in Group II, and 91.4218.73 in Group III. NLR and PLR values in the high myopia groups were significantly higher than in the control group. NLR and PLR values in cases with high axial myopia were higher than in the emmetropic group. Higher inflammation in the degenerative myopic group in particular may be related to pathological chorioretinal changes. &quot;</field>
