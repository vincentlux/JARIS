<field name="content">Malignant transformation of a conjunctival keratoacanthoma requiring enucleation.,&quot;To investigate the efficacy and safety of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) for corneal decompensation following primary Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). This was a retrospective case series of 15 patients that underwent DMEK surgery for corneal decompensation after failed DSAEK. Main outcome parameter was corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) after DMEK and DSAEK. Secondary outcome measures included central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell density (ECD), rebubbling rate, and primary graft failure after DMEK. Explanted DSAEK grafts were evaluated by light microscopy. The mean (SD) time period between DSAEK and DMEK surgery was 158 months (range, 6-31 months). Preoperative CDVA was 1.720.62 (logMAR). After DMEK, CDVA improved significantly to 0.780.48 at 1 month and to 0.230.24 after 12 months (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;=0.022). Visual acuity data after DMEK were significantly better compared to preoperative values. The average CCT after DMEK decreased significantly from 869210 m (preoperative) to 50545 m (1 month postoperative) (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) and remained stable over 12 months. The ECD decreased from 2,589209/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (preoperative) to 1,691589/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (12 months postoperative). Rebubbling DMEK was required in three patients (=20%). DMEK represents a feasible and safe procedure in achieving better functional results compared to DSAEK. Visual acuity and optical quality can be effectively reestablished after unsuccessful primary DSAEK surgery even in patients with long-standing corneal decompensation. Further investigations are required to validate the preliminary clinical findings. &quot;</field>
