The HmA particles presented a high loading capacity, a wide variety of loadable drugs, minimal cytotoxicity, quick internalization, the ability to bypass the lysosomes, and rapid intracellular drug release. In addition, HmA encapsulation largely improved the antitumor ability of camptothecin (CPT) relative to free CPT. By capitalizing on these promising features in drug delivery, HmA will have great potential in various biomedical fields.
