<field name="content">Clinical predictors at diagnosis of low risk histopathology in unilateral advanced retinoblastoma.,&quot;Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive ocular imaging technique that is frequently used in the diagnosis and monitoring of optic nerve or retinal disease. Advances in optical coherence tomography speed and image processing capability allow increased use of the modality in clinical practice, especially in younger children. This review outlines the challenges involved in imaging children, highlights the technological progress, the importance of acquiring normative data and, finally, focuses on the clinical applicability of optical coherence tomography in our paediatric population with various ocular conditions. &quot;</field>
