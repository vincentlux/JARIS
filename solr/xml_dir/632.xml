<field name="content">Interocular transfer of visual memory - Influence of visual impairment and abnormalities of the optic chiasm.,&quot;Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new modality in ocular imaging which provides non-invasive assessment and measurement of the vascular structures in the retina and optic nerve head. This technique provides useful information in glaucoma, such as quantitative assessment of vessel density. Vessel density measurement can be affected by various subject-related, eye-related, and disease-related factors. Overall, OCTA has good repeatability and reproducibility, and can differentiate glaucoma eyes from normal eyes. It can also help detect early glaucoma, reach a floor effect at a more advanced disease stage than optical coherence tomography (OCT), and adds information about glaucoma patients at risk of progression. Although it has higher variability than OCT, it also promises to be useful for monitoring glaucoma by detecting progression throughout the glaucoma continuum. &quot;</field>
