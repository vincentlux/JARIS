<field name="content">Occupational Vision Loss Following Alexandrite Laser Exposure.,&quot;To describe the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to quantitatively monitor the conjunctival graft revascularization after pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft (CAG) transplantation. Prospective, interventional case series. Ten patients undergoing pterygium excision and femtosecond laser-assisted CAG transplantation were included. OCTA was performed at 1 week, 1 and 3 months postoperatively at the CAG transplantation site and harvested area. The vessel density at three different depths: conjunctival epithelium or CAG epithelium, conjunctival stroma or CAG stroma, and episclera, was evaluated and quantified. The revascularization rate was assessed and correlated with the postoperative CAG thickness. No intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred. Reperfusion of the CAGs was observed at 1 week, and early reperfusion within the first month accounted for more than half of graft revascularization. The vessel regrowth density was 9.62.6 % and 11.12.8 % between 1 week and 1 month, and was 9.81.8 % and 11.91.9 % between 1 and 3 months, at the CAG and underlying episcleral levels, respectively. All the CAGs were well-perfused at 3 months. The vessel regrowth density was significantly and strongly correlated with the changes of CAG thickness in a negative relationship (=-0.94, P=0.019). At the harvested site, the vascular network of episclera was not affected, and the conjunctival vascularization was restored at 1 month. OCTA is a promising tool to evaluate the vascularization or revascularization of conjunctiva, conjunctival graft and episclera, in a quantitative and serial manner, helping in diseases diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The graft revascularization rate was predictive of postoperative graft deswelling. &quot;</field>
