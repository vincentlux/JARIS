<field name="content">Long Non-Coding RNA BANCR Is Overexpressed in Patients with Diabetic Retinopathy and Promotes Apoptosis of Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.,&quot;&lt;b&gt;\n                        &lt;i&gt;Purpose:&lt;/i&gt;\n                    &lt;/b&gt; To investigate retinal gene expression of tetramethylpyrazine (TMP) eye drop-treated endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in mice and to explore the mechanisms. &lt;b&gt;\n                        &lt;i&gt;Methods:&lt;/i&gt;\n                    &lt;/b&gt; The inflammatory signs of the anterior segment were evaluated, and clinical scores were graded. The retinal transcriptome from the TMP eye drop-treated and the untreated mice was identified by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) strategy. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were validated by real-time PCR. The protein-protein interaction was analyzed using the STRING software. &lt;b&gt;\n                        &lt;i&gt;Results:&lt;/i&gt;\n                    &lt;/b&gt; Compared with the TMP-treated group, the inflammatory responses of the untreated control group were much severe and clinical score was remarkably higher (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;0.001) at 24h after lipopolysaccharide administration. RNA-seq assay identified 407 DEGs, among which 356 were upregulated and 51 were downregulated. There were 12 upregulated gene ontology terms enriched and 27 upregulated pathways. Seven DEGs, including inflammation-related, complement system-related, and interferon-related genes, were validated using quantitative PCR. &lt;b&gt;\n                        &lt;i&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/i&gt;\n                    &lt;/b&gt; TMP exerted anti-inflammatory effect in EIU. Local application of TMP inhibited retinal inflammatory response by regulating the inflammation-related genes, suggesting that TMP may be a potential novel therapeutic drug for ocular inflammation. &quot;</field>
