<field name="content">[Interventional therapy of colorectal liver metastasis].,"This review article aims to provide an overview of image-guided ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) since it was first introduced in 1998. This will cover the background and rationale behind its development; an overview of the evidence for current thermal technology, such as heat-based, e.g., radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cold-based energies, e.g., cryoablation used; and summarise the published evidence regarding its treatment efficacy and oncological outcome. In addition, it aims to provide an insight into the potential role of the new non-thermal ablative technology, e.g., irreversible electroporation (IRE)/Nanoknife in image-guided ablation of RCC, as well as areas of challenge that will require further research and clinical evaluation to ensure delivery of a quality patient-centred interventional oncology (IO) service in image-guided ablation of RCC."
