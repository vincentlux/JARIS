<field name="content">Anterior Segment Parameters of Filipino-Americans Compared to Chinese-Americans and Caucasian Americans Using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography.,&quot;Abnormal retinal neovascularization associated with various retinopathies can result in irreversible vision loss. Although the mechanisms involved in this occurrence is unclear, increasing evidence suggests that aberrant Wnt signaling participates in the pathogenesis of abnormal neovascularization. Because Wntsignaling upregulation can be induced by oxidative stress through the activation of disheveled (DVL), a key molecule in the Wntsignaling pathway, we investigated whether oxidative stress can activate Wnt signaling and induce angiogenic phenotypes in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We found that increased Wntsignaling activity, as well as enhanced angiogenic phenotypes, such as tube formation and cell migration, were detected in the hydrogen peroxide-treated HRMECs. Moreover, these effects were effectively suppressed by a small-molecule Wnt inhibitor targeting the PDZ domain of DVL. Therefore, we propose that targeting abnormal Wnt signaling at the DVL level with a small-molecule inhibitor may represent a novel approach in retinal neovascularization treatment and prevention. &quot;</field>
