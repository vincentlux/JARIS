<field name="content">Comparison of Small Incision Lenticule Extraction Surgery With and Without Cyclotorsion Error Correction for Patients With Astigmatism.,&quot;To assess the variations induced by exercise in retinal vascular density (VD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, and fractal dimension (FD) at the superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexa in healthy subjects by means of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Consecutive healthy subjects were prospectively included into two groups, ranging in age from 18 to 29 years for group 1 and from 30 to 40 years for group 2. Data from 3  3-mm OCT-A acquisition centered on the macula at SCP and DCP (VD, FAZ area, and FD), heart rate, and systolic-diastolic blood pressure were collected before and after a 20-minute standardized physical exercise on a stationary bicycle. Both eyes of 32 healthy volunteers were prospectively included (15 in group 1 and 17 in group 2). Mean age was 27  7 years. In the overall analysis and for each group, a decrease of VD at the level of SCP and an increase of FD at the level of DCP were significant after exercise. A significant correlation was found between these modifications of retinal vascularization and the increase of systolic blood pressure induced by exercise. All cardiovascular parameters increased significantly with exercise. No significant difference was found between the two groups, and no incident was reported. A significant correlation was established between systemic cardiovascular modifications (reflected by systolic blood pressure) and local retinal vascularization changes at SCP during exercise. A rest period might be recommended before OCT-A data acquisition, as modifications of cardiovascular parameters could distort retinal vascular data. &quot;</field>
