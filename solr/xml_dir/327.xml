<field name="content">Rare Case of Nerve Sheath Myxoma of the Eyelid Misdiagnosed as Mucocele.,&quot;We hypothesized that the ocular dominance associated with brain asymmetry would influence macular structure. We assessed the structural asymmetry of the macula by ocular dominance. A total of 144 patients with no ophthalmic abnormalities were examined. After classifying eyes as dominant or non-dominant using the hole-in-a-card test, the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer and the macular thickness were measured in both groups using spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and we sought associations between ocular dominance and retinal thickness. Ocular dominance was more frequently found in right eyes than in left eyes (68.75% vs 31.25%, respectively; p &lt; 0.001). Using conditioned logistic regression, the right eye and the temporal-to-nasal retinal thickness ratio of the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer were selected as a final model for the determination of ocular dominance (p &lt; 0.001, p = 0.013 respectively). Macular vertical asymmetry was associated with ocular dominance. The macular structure and ocular dominance associated with visual cortex lateralization have functional and structural relationships. &quot;</field>
