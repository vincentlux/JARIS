<field name="content">Assessment of physiological upper eyelid laxity.,&quot;To describe our early experience with gene expression profiling (GEP) assessment for juxtafoveal, subfoveal, and peripapillary indeterminate high-risk melanocytic lesions to assist in making early treatment decisions in patients who did not feel comfortable with either close observation or definitive treatment. A prospective cohort of patients with indeterminate lesions who underwent GEP were enrolled. Nonparametric statistical analysis was utilized given the small sample size. Fifteen patients were included in this series. Six (40%) were class 1A and 9 (60%) class 1B. Class 1A and 1B lesions had a median of three and four clinical risk factors, respectively (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.27). There was no statistically significant difference for the largest basal diameter between the classes (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.31); however, class 1B lesions were thicker than class 1A lesions (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). None of the class 1A lesions showed definite growth or metastasis over a mean follow-up period of 17.1  1.8 months from fine needle aspiration biopsy. All class 1B patients opted for plaque brachytherapy, and to date none of these patients have developed metastasis, with a mean follow-up of 18.7  8.4 months. There may be a role for GEP assessment in high-risk, indeterminate, posteriorly located choroidal lesions to assist in treatment planning. &quot;</field>
