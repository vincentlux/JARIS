<field name="content">Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography and Glaucoma: A Brief Review.,&quot;A 48-year-old woman presented with bilateral non-pulsatile proptosis and ophthalmoplegia after 3days following blunt orbital trauma. It was associated with fever, malaise and loss of vision in right eye. She was provisionally diagnosed with cavernous sinus thrombosis and was treated with intravenous antibiotics with no improvement. A subtle bruit was present on examination, and digital subtraction angiography revealed a right direct (type A) carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). The patient underwent right coil embolisation of direct CCF. On follow-up at 4months, her proptosis resolved completely and extraocular movements improved. &quot;</field>
