<field name="content">&quot;A triad of retinal signs in Alport syndrome: The &apos;stair-case&apos; fovea, choroidal thinning and peripheral schisis.&quot;,&quot;To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a nuclear factor-B (NF-B) inhibitor, on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats. EIU was induced by a subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Lewis rats. DHMEQ was injected intraperitoneally concurrently with the LPS. Aqueous humor was collected 24h after the LPS injection. Isolated peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were exposed to LPS with or without DHMEQ to determine the production of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1. DHMEQ significantly reduced the number of infiltrating cells, and the concentrations of proteins, TNF-, and IL-6 in the aqueous humor. DHMEQ suppressed the production of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 from PECs. Immunochemistry revealed a reduction in the translocation of the NF-B p65 into the nuclei in DHMEQ-exposed PECs. The results indicate that DHMEQ has anti-inflammatory effects on EIU and may be a promising agent to treat intraocular inflammation. &quot;</field>
