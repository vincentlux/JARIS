<field name="content">Ocular surface system alterations in ocular graft-versus-host disease: all the pieces of the complex puzzle.,&quot;To report the efficacy of the use of a new scleral depressor marker during scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. Noncomparative, consecutive case series study. Eleven patients (11 eyes) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment who underwent scleral buckling surgery performed by 2 experienced vitreoretinal surgeons. The prototype of a new indenter marker was used during scleral buckling surgery. The possibility of performing simultaneous indentation and selected marking of the desired area was assessed. Additionally, the precision of the fiber light-assisted indentation as well as force of indentation were evaluated. The use of a new depressor marker facilitated a quick and effective flow of the standard surgery for retinal detachment. It was possible to perform indentation and marking as separate steps of 1 session. Only desired areas of the sclera were marked during the same indentation session. The indentation required less force. When combined with chandelier light, the precision of the marking was improved as demonstrated by a light from the chandelier indicating the highest point of the indentation area. There were no complications related to the use of the new instrument. The newly developed scleral depressor marker facilitated simultaneous indentation and marking on the sclera. The new instrument allowed for the selective marking of the desired areas during the same session of indentation. Additionally, it can be combined with chandelier fiber light, which improves the precision of the marking. &quot;</field>
