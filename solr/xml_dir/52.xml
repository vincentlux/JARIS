<field name="content">The Hopeless Case? Palliative Cryoablation and Cementoplasty Procedures for Palliation of Large Pelvic Bone Metastases.,"Ablation of paraspinal lesions close to the spinal canal and neuroforamina requires protective measures in order to protect the spinal cord and nerve roots. Various methods of protection have been previously described including infusion of saline and CO<sub>2</sub>. Regardless, neuromonitoring should be adjunctively performed when ablating spinal lesions close to neuronal structures. Balloon protection has been previously described during ablation of renal masses. The benefit of balloon protection in paraspinal mass ablation is it physically displaces the nerve roots as opposed to CO<sub>2</sub> or saline which has the potential to insulate but because of its aerosolized or fluid nature may or may not provide definitive continuous protection throughout an ablation. This report details three paraspinal lesions, two of which were successfully ablated with the use of a balloon placed in the epidural space to provide protection to the spinal cord and nerve roots."
