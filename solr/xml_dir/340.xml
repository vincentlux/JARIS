<field name="content">The localization of a conjunctivoscleral foreign body via high-resolution microscopy coil magnetic resonance imaging in a dog.,&quot;Clerkship at the University of British Columbia (UBC) Medical School encompasses a variety of models: traditional rotation-based clerkship; distributed rotation-based clerkship at sites across the province; and a longitudinal integrated community clerkship. The purpose of this study was to: (i) Evaluate the undergraduate ophthalmology clerkship experience at UBC to compare outcomes and experiences across the various sites and models; and (ii) Apply educational theories to evaluation outcomes in order to improve curriculum design for clerkship programs. Cross-sectional evaluation of the ophthalmology clerkship program at UBC. Using a logic model, we identified inputs, activities, and outputs of the ophthalmology clerkship experience at each site at UBC. Site directors and administrators were contacted for information regarding program curriculum and delivery, and outcomes were described using written exam and clinical assessment scores as well as student and instructor feedback (questionnaires with narrative responses). Site directors and administrators from all clerkship sites participated in the study. Clerkship experiences across all sites (rotation-based and integrated community clerkship) were found to be unique in contexts and clinical activities. There were no significant differences noted between outcomes in the rotation-based sites. Clerkship experiences can be delivered in various contexts and through varied clinical settings, yet provide an equivalent student learning experience. As longitudinal and distributed clerkship models gain traction in medical education around the world, there are lessons for undergraduate medical education both in ophthalmology and in other areas. &quot;</field>
