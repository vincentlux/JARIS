<field name="content">&quot;The Relative Impact of Patient, Physician, and Geographic Factors on Variation in Primary Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Management.&quot;,&quot;We detected retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) with both blue and green laser sources and evaluated image quality based on laser wavelength. This was a retrospective observational case study. Blue and green CSLO images of 181 eyes with suspected glaucoma were evaluated and compared. Three independent observers identified the presence of RNFL defects and determined which CSLO imaging source provided superior visibility of the defect. After assessing the defect imaging by laser source, demographics and image quality indices of optical coherence tomography between blue better and green better groups were analyzed. Both blue and green CSLO showed high discriminating ability for RNFL defects. The discriminating ability of blue CSLO was significantly greater than that of green CSLO (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.004). Among eyes with a detectable RNFL defect, 61.8% were better visualized with the blue laser compared to the green laser. Compared with the blue better group, the green better group was significantly older (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.009), had a greater proportion of females (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.005), had poorer best-corrected visual acuity (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), more severe cataracts (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001), lower signal strength (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.003), and poor image quality indices (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.001). Both blue and green CSLO imaging was useful for detecting RNFL defects, but blue CSLO was superior to green CSLO in quality of RNFL defect imaging in most patients with clear media. &quot;</field>
