<field name="content">Advancement flap for anterior lamellar reconstruction of the upper eyelid.,&quot;Elevated cortisol level is an component of the stress response. However, some patients have low cortisol levels; a condition termed: critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). Basal cortisol levels during PICU admission may be related to outcome. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess basal total serum cortisol levels and their relation to outcome in PICU. The study included 81 children over 6 months.Total serum cortisol was assessed using an early morning sample. The severity of illness was assessed using the PRISM-IIIscore. Outcome measures included mechanical ventilation duration, use of inotropic support, length of stay, mortality. Comparison between patients&apos; subgroups according to total serum cortisol levels revealed significantly higher PRISM-III score in patients with total serum cortisol levels. In addition, those patients had a significantly higher mortality rate when compared with patients with low and normal total serum cortisol levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis recognized high total serum cortisol level and PRISM-III score as significant predictors of mortality. We concluded that PRISM-III score and elevated total serum cortisol levels are significant predictors of mortality in the PICU. Although CIRCI is prevalent in this population, it wasn&apos;t associated with an increased mortality rate. &quot;</field>
