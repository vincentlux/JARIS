<field name="content">Use of Autologous Oral Mucosa Transplant to Treat Conjunctival Necrosis and Leakage after Trabeculectomy.,&quot;Report 5-year outcomes of patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for the treatment of macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO. Retrospective review of eyes with RVO which initiated anti-VEGF treatment. Data including age, gender, visual acuity (VA) and injection numbers were obtained from medical records. Optical coherence tomography scans were graded for presence or absence of macular oedema and central foveal thickness (CFT). Macular perfusion was assessed on fundus fluorescein angiography by masked graders. 68 eyes (31 branch RVO, BRVO; 35 central RVO, CRVO and 2 hemi-RVO) with 5 years of follow-up after initiation of anti-VEGF treatment. Mean change in VA at 5years was + 9.6  21.6 letters among CRVO eyes and + 14.2  15.6 letters among eyes with BRVO (p=0.001). Vision of 20/40 or better was achieved in 65 % of treated eyes. The proportion of eyes with a three-line improvement of vision (15 letters) at 5years was 22 %. Mean CFT decreased by 257.6  249.8m in eyes with CRVO and 145.6  143.3 m in eyes with BRVO. The results confirm good long-term outcomes can be achieved with anti-VEGF therapy for RVO. &quot;</field>
