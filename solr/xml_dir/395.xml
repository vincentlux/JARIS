<field name="content">Sleep outcomes associated with dry eye disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,&quot;Berberine, a Chinese medical herbal extract, plays a key role in antidiabetic, antiangiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antihypercholesterolemic. Our previous studies revealed that berberine exerted odontoprotective effect by increasing odontoblast differentiation. However, the mechanisms involved in the odontoprotective effect of berberine have not been fully explored. The Wnt/-catenin pathway is involved in odontoblast differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). If -catenin is nuclear translocation, the Wnt/-catenin pathway is activation. In this study, DPSCs were treated with or without berberine. Then, we examined the accelerative effects of berberine on odontoblast differentiation and mineralized nodules formation by real-time polymerase chain reaction, alizarin red S staining, and alkaline phosphatase staining. In addition, while treated with berberine, -catenin translocated to the nucleus evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Our results revealed that berberine functions as a promoter of odontoblast differentiation by promoting Wnt/-catenin pathway, suggesting that it may be useful in guiding therapeutic strategies for the treatment of dental caries. &quot;</field>
