<field name="content">Doubles trouble-85 cases of ocular trauma in badminton: clinical features and prevention.,&quot;&lt;b&gt;Objective:&lt;/b&gt; Traumatic superior orbital fissure syndrome is a rare complication that occurs in association with craniofacial trauma. In the present case, there were no associated orbital fractures or other lesions to explain. &lt;b&gt;Methods:&lt;/b&gt; We present a-16-year-old patient with total ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and anesthesia of the upper eyelid and forehead 6 hours after a reported trauma to the left eye. We measured the width of the superior orbital fissure on the horizontal plane including the optic canal using computed tomography scans. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; Radiological examinations did not reveal any orbital fractures. However, the superior orbital fissure on the affected side was only 1.86 mm, increasing susceptibility to indirect trauma. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; A narrow superior orbital fissure may play a role for superior orbital fissure syndrome altering the transmitted force from the trauma and edema. &quot;</field>
