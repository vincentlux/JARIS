<field name="content">&quot;Effect of Topical 1% Cyclopentolate Hydrochloride on Tear Production, Intraocular Pressure, and Pupil Size in Healthy Turkman Horses.&quot;,&quot;To study the relationship between epithelial thickness (ET) and corneal thickness (CT) in healthy fellow eyes of patients with unilateral bullous keratopathy (BKP) and healthy subjects. Seventeen BKP patients (nine males, eight females, 73.210.4 years) and 40 healthy individuals (20 males, 20 females, 69.59.8 years) were included. All participants received anterior segment optical coherence tomography and specular microscopy with calculation of endothelial cell density. ET, CT, stromal thickness and ET-to-CT ratio were defined automatically (within 2mm central area). Central epithelial thickness (CET) and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured manually at the corneal centre and stromal thickness and CET-to-CCT ratio were calculated. In healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients compared with eyes of healthy individuals ET was statistically significantly lower (p&lt;0.001) while CT was statistically significantly higher (by 28.9 and 30.9m in 2mm zone and corneal centre, respectively). Both 2mm ET-to-CT ratio (0.0910.01and 0.100.004, respectively [p&lt;0.001]) and CET-to-CCT ratio (0.0830.006and 0.970.005, respectively [p&lt;0.0001]) were statistically significantly lower in healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients compared with eyes of healthy individuals. To identify healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients, area under curve for CET-to-CCT ratio and CET was 0.94 and 0.80, respectively (p=0.01), and for 2mm ET-to-CT ratio and 2mm ET was 0.91 and 0.80, respectively (p=0.03). Decreased ET-to-CT ratio resulting from simultaneous epithelial thinning and stromal thickening without significant corneal thickening indicates subclinical dysfunction of corneal endothelium in healthy fellow eyes in unilateral BKP patients. &quot;</field>
