<field name="content">Emergent radiation for leukemic optic nerve infiltration in a child receiving intrathecal methotrexate.,&quot;The aim of this review is to summarize developments in the treatment of active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). PCV is associated with a poor visual prognosis as a consequence the condition&apos;s hallmark polypoidal dilatation and a branching network resulting in recurrent hemorrhages and serous leakage. Recent research has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of PCV. While still considered a subtype of age-related macular degeneration, suggestions that PCV belongs to a spectrum of conditions that present with a pachychoroid are increasingly well accepted. Treatment remains challenging. Combination therapy (photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) is associated with higher polyp closure rate, but polyp closure rate has not been correlated with superior visual outcomes. Current data points to non-inferiority of anti-VEGF alone versus combined with PDT when final vision acuity is the study outcome. PCV remains a clinical challenge. Classification and treatment of the condition continues to evolve. Combination therapy may not be superior to anti-VEGF treatment alone in terms of visual acuity outcome, however data on long-term recurrence should be compared in formulating preferred treatment plans. &quot;</field>
