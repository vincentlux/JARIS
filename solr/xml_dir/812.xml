<field name="content">Serum and aqueous humor vitamin D levels in patients with diabetic macular edema.,&quot;The periocular space is a promising alternative route for the delivery of drugs to the posterior eye segment, especially when treating conditions in the outer ocular layers. In this review, we discuss the different periocular routes as well as the physiological barriers and elimination mechanisms limiting drug bioavailability at the back of the eye. We then highlight various types of depot formulation, including particulate delivery systems, semisolid formulations, and implants, used to increase the contact time with the ocular tissues. With the additional advantage of sustaining drug release, such depot formulations could enhance periocular drug delivery to the posterior eye segment. &quot;</field>
