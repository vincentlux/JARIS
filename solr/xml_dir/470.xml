<field name="content">Combining SRET&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and BiFC to Study GPCR Heteromerization and Protein-Protein Interactions.,&quot;A 10-year-old boy was referred for a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma with underlying exudative detachment of the left eye. To avoid general anesthetics required for laser-based therapy in a child, we began a trial of oral propranolol. The patient&apos;s exudative detachment resolved, with resulting improvement in visual acuity, and remained quiescent for 3 years. &quot;</field>
