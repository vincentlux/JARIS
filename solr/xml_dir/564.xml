<field name="content">Differences in Cataract Surgery Rates Based on Dementia Status.,&quot;PRCIS:: Optic nerve head perfusion was not significantly altered in subjects with normal tension glaucoma nor healthy individuals after performing the water drinking test, due to its limited effect on ocular perfusion pressure. Optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow can be maintained stable in healthy individuals because of a physiological phenomenon called autoregulation. Impairment of autoregulation has been shown especially under condition of normal tension glaucoma (NTG). The purpose of this study was to investigate the ONH blood flow autoregulation in patients with NTG by influencing the ocular perfusion pressure with the water drinking test. The study included 9 eyes from 9 Caucasian patients with diagnosis of normal tension glaucoma and 9 eyes from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. In the glaucoma group, the antiglaucomatous therapy was paused 3 weeks prior to the investigations. Measurements of optic nerve head blood flow were performed with laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). After baseline measurements, individuals ingested 800mL of water in less than five minutes. Measurements were repeated after 15, 30 and 45 minutes. The water ingestion led to a significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) (P&lt;0.001) but also mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P&lt;0.001) in both groups. This resulted in stable ocular perfusion pressures (OPP) (P=0.051) with no significant difference between the groups (P=0.43). ONH blood flow remained stable over time in both groups (P=0.719). No significant interaction of time and group was shown for all parameters. Our findings show that the WDT does not significantly influence the OPP and therefore has to be considered inferior to other methods used to assess blood flow autoregulation. &quot;</field>
