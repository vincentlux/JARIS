<field name="content">Impact of antibiotic treatment and host innate immune pressure on enterococcal adaptation in the human bloodstream.,&quot;To evaluate the choroidal thickness (CT) in foveal and parafoveal regions in Thai adults using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). We enrolled healthy volunteers 18 years of age from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, during September 2015 to March 2016. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula was performed, and subfoveal CT was measured manually using a line scan. Average thicknesses of retinal and choroidal layers in regions of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid were measured automatically. A multivariate analysis was conducted to determine correlations between CTs in the foveal and parafoveal regions and retinal layers. Altogether, 144 eyes from 144 subjects (29 men, 115 women; mean age 41 years) were studied. The mean foveal CT was 282.413.8m. It was thicker in the temporal fovea than in the nasal fovea (p&lt;0.001) and thicker in men than in women. Multivariate analysis showed that age and sex were significantly negatively correlated with the thickness of the retina, ganglion cell layer, outer retinal layer, and choroid but not of the nerve fiber layer. Regression analysis revealed that the CT decreased approximately 1.5m per year. Age and sex significantly influence choroidal thickness. Macular CT in a healthy eye thins with age. CT decreases with age faster at distances away from the foveal center than at the center. Subfoveal CT was greater than the mean CT. Parafoveal CT should be evaluated to identify specific retinal-choroidal disease. &quot;</field>
