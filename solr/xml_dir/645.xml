<field name="content">Isolated Abducens Nerve Palsy as Manifestation of Diffuse Intracranial Dolichoectasia.,&quot;Orbital sparganosis represents an extremely rare condition with only a few cases being reported in literature. Here we describe cases of orbital sparganosis, including their etiology, clinical findings, and surgical outcomes. A retrospective review was performed on patients with orbital sparganosis, who were treated at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, of Sun Yat-sen University, China between 2000 and 2012. Five patients (three males and two females, one right orbit and four left orbits) were identified. Their mean age was 14.8 years (range=6-33 years). Four cases were contracted from eating raw snakes and fishes, or placing poultices of frog on open wounds. All cases showed a swelling and/or redness of the eyelid and conjunctiva, and a migrating inflammation was present in one of the cases. High levels of blood eosinophils were observed in three of these cases. Of the two patients examined using computed tomography, one showed a diffuse soft tissue infiltration and a punctate calcification, while one of the three patients examined using magnetic resonance imaging displayed an annular &quot;&quot;tunnel sign&quot;&quot; within the lesion. All patients underwent an anterior orbitotomy and the entire worm was removed with no surgical complications. Orbital sparganosis should be highly suspected in patients with a history of eating raw snakes and frogs, a migrating orbital inflammation and the presence of eosinophilia. Orbital imaging examinations play an important role in the diagnosis of orbital sparganosis. Surgical removal of the entire worm is required. &quot;</field>
