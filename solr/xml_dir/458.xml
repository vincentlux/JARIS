<field name="content">Arbutin attenuates hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury through regulation of microRNA-29a in retinal ganglion cells.,&quot;A Fe-FeO/rGO nanocomposite with heterostructure has been successfully synthesized by a highyield, low-cost, and easily operated room-temperature reduction method. The novel Fe-FeO/rGO composite exhibits an excellent activity for the degradation of Orange II under visible light by the Photo-Fenton process, which is 92.06% after 180 minutes. Moreover, magnetic analysis indicated that the prepared Fe-FeO/rGO composite possesses ferromagnetic properties, which enable it to be magnetically separated for recycling purposes. &quot;</field>
