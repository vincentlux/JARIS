<field name="content">In Support of Ophthalmology-Specific Patient-Reported Outcome Measures.,&quot;Children with conversion disorder experience neurological symptoms without a definable organic cause. Clinical presentation of conversion disorders is uncommon in the emergency department (ED). An 11-year-old previously healthy girl presented to the ED for management of lobar pneumonia. She developed acute visual loss subsequent to accidental placement of an intra-arterial cannula in her arm. Clinical assessments by the emergency physician, neurology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry services, and negative neuroimaging studies established the diagnosis of functional visual loss as a manifestation of conversion disorder. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Conversion disorder symptoms are often without any specific markers and do not fit standard clinical guidelines. A comprehensive and step-wise evaluation of unusual clinical presentation by multiple specialties and ancillary test results should be considered to rule out organic causes and establish the diagnosis of conversion disorder, as seen in our patient. &quot;</field>
