<field name="content">Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Mice: Quantitative Analysis After Experimental Models of Retinal Damage.,&quot;Traditional hydrodissection may cause posterior capsule rupture (PCR) if excessive fluid accumulates. In this study, we describe the successful application of a novel minimal fluid hydrodissection technique in 100 consecutive cataract surgery cases. This technique separates the nucleus from the capsule utilizing low hydrostatic pressure and precise kinetic movement of a small volume (around 0.2 cc) of balanced salt solution. There were no instances of PCR. This technique is suitable for a range of cases, including femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and posterior subcapsular cataract. &quot;</field>
