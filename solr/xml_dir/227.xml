<field name="content">INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CUTANEOUS KERATINOCYTIC AND MELANOCYTIC MALIGNANCIES IN PATIENTS WITH AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.,&quot;To evaluate qualitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and quantitative parameters, such as central macular thickness (CMT) and subfoveolar choroidal thickness (SFCT), in the eyes of preeclamptic women. The prospective, comparative, cross-sectional study included 52 eyes of 52 preeclamptic (PE) women and 54 eyes of 54 healthy pregnant women in their second or third trimester. Central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveolar choroidal thickness (SFCT), were evaluated in relation to presence of positive qualitative OCT findings such as any subretinal or intraretinal fluid, irregularity on the external photoreceptor and RPE layer, or presence of pigment epithelial detachment. No significant difference was detected between the PE group and the healthy pregnant group with respect to CMT (P=0.905), but the mean SFCT value was significantly higher in the PE group than in the healthy pregnant group (391.471.1 vs 331.553.8m, P &lt;0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that SFCT could predict qualitative OCT findings in preeclampsia, and the optimal cut-off value was 400m with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 85%. The eyes of preeclamptic women, and particularly those with positive qualitative OCT findings, showed significantly increased SFCT values. A preliminary cut-off level of 400m for SFCT is proposed for the prediction of severe preeclampsia. &quot;</field>
