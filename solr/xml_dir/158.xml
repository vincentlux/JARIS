<field name="content">Angiopoietin-2 as a Marker of Retinopathy in Children and Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease: Relation to Subclinical Atherosclerosis.,&quot;Many neuropsychiatric phenotypes have been reported in association with rearrangements in the 15q11-q13 region. Clinical presentations can include hypotonia, developmental delay, severe/moderate intellectual disabilities, poor expressive language, difficult to treat epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. Here we report an additional case of a girl with inversion duplication on chromosome 15 (Inv-Dup 15) showing a peculiar and milder clinical phenotype, including atypical high-functioning autism disorder, late onset and drug-responsive epilepsy, and a relatively good language development . This report suggests that a diagnosis of Inv-Dup (15) can be suspected during more benign atypical condition with a better outcome than usually reported. &quot;</field>
