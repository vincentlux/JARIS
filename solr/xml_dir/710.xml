<field name="content">Complication and prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis in the era of modern immunomodulatory treatment.,&quot;Mutations of claudin-19 cause Familial Hypomagnesaemia and Hypercalciuria, Nephrocalcinosis with Ocular Involvement. To study the ocular disease without the complications of the kidney disease, naturally occurring point mutations of human CLDN19 were recreated in human induced pluripotent cells or overexpressed in the retinae of newborn mice. In human induced pluripotent cells, we show that the mutation affects retinal neurogenesis and maturation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In mice, the mutations diminish the P1 wave of the electroretinogram, activate apoptosis in the outer nuclear layer, and alter the morphology of bipolar cells. If mice are given &lt;i&gt;9-cis&lt;/i&gt;-retinal to counter the loss of retinal isomerase, the P1 wave is partially restored. The ARPE19 cell line fails to express claudin-19. Exogenous expression of wild type, but not mutant claudin-19, increases the expression of RPE signature genes. Mutated claudin-19 affects multiple stages of RPE and retinal differentiation through its effects on multiple functions of the RPE. &quot;</field>
