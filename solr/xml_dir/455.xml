<field name="content">Pulse Pressure is a Stronger Predictor Than Systolic Blood Pressure for Severe Eye Diseases in Diabetes Mellitus.,&quot;The management of A or V pattern deviation associated with esotropia can be challenging since the horizontal deviation changes with position of gaze. This study aimed to assess the effect of unilateral horizontal rectus surgery for the correction of horizontal deviation associated with A or V pattern in children with non-comitant infantile esotropia. Twenty-seven children with infantile esotropia and A-V pattern, more than 10 and 15 prism diopters respectively, were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. Horizontal rectus surgery was performed on the most deviated eye under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups: A pattern and V pattern. The outcome measures were change in the amount of pattern and rate of regression after surgery. The amount of pattern was characterized by the difference in esodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. Horizontal deviation at distance and near fixation decreased significantly (P&lt;0.0001). Vertical gaze esotropia disparity decreased significantly (P=0.01 and P=0.0002 for A and V patterns respectively). A pattern esotropia was reported in only 2 (7%) cases after surgery compared to 9 (33%) before surgery. The number of subjects with V pattern esotropia decreased from 18 (67%) to 3 (11%) after surgery. The mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of A and V patterns may not always be related to oblique muscle dysfunction. These findings suggest that unilateral horizontal rectus surgery may be an effective procedure to correct both horizontal deviation and A-V pattern in non-comitant infantile esotropia. &quot;</field>
