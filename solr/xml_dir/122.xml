<field name="content">Spectrum of mutations in the &lt;i&gt;RB1&lt;/i&gt; gene in Vietnamese patients with retinoblastoma.,&quot;Endothelial dysfunction is one of the key risk factors in diabetes-related multi-organ damage. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl mainly generated as a by-product of glycolysis, is increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. MGO can rapidly bind with proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, resulting in structural and functional changes of these targets and can form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). However, exactly how MGO causes endothelial cell dysfunction is not clear. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) from healthy (H-HAECs) and type 2 diabetic (D-HAECs) donors were cultured in endothelial growth media (EGM-2). D-HAECs demonstrated impaired tube formation (on Matrigel) and proliferation (MTT assay), as well as increased apoptosis (TUNEL staining), compared with H-HAECs. H-HAECs were treated with MGO (10M) for 24 hours with or without ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt;) channel antagonist glibenclamide (1M). MGO significantly impaired H-HAECs tube formation and proliferation and induced cell apoptosis which was reversed by glibenclamide. Meanwhile, activation of MAPK pathways p38 kinase, JNK, and ERK (determined by Western blot analyses of their phosphorylated forms, p-JNK, p-p38 and p-ERK) in D-HAECs were significantly enhanced compared with those in H-HAECs. MGO exposure enhanced the activation of all three MAPK pathways in H-HAECs, while glibenclamide reversed the activation of P-SAPK/JNK induced by MGO. Our data suggests MGO triggers endothelial cell dysfunction by activating JNK/P38 MAPK pathway, partly through activation of K&lt;sub&gt;ATP&lt;/sub&gt; channel. Our study may provide useful information for developing MGO-targeted interventions to treat vascular disorders in diabetes. &quot;</field>
