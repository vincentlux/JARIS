<field name="content">Novel hybrid action of GABA mediates inhibitory feedback in the mammalian retina.,&quot;Subscleral trabeculectomy is the most common surgical treatment for glaucoma. However, wound healing and scar formation may result in bleb fibrosis, leading to bleb failure. The healing response of the wound is reported to be the single most important risk factor in determining the final intraocular pressure after glaucoma filtration surgery. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative beta irradiation and intraoperative mitomycin C treatment as combined adjuncts to subscleral trabeculectomy in the management of glaucoma in Egyptian patients. This prospective, interventional, comparative masked clinical study was performed between October 2016 and January 2018. This study included 50 subjects, 25 of whom underwent trabeculectomy augmented by mitomycin C intra-operatively and beta radiation preoperatively at the bleb area (patient group #1). The remaining 25 subjects underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C alone (control group #2). Beta radiation was administered 5-7 days before the surgery as a single dose (1000cGy) using a strontium-90 probe. Mitomycin C (0.2mg/mL) was administered for 2 minutes. There was a statistically significant difference in postoperative intraocular pressure between the groups from the second week. Intraoperative hyphema occurred in six cases in control group #2, whereas no intraoperative hyphema was observed in patient group#1; this difference was statistically significant. Subscleral trabeculectomy augmented by beta radiation and mitomycin C gives greater control over intraocular pressure. Therefore, we recommend using beta radiation prior to trabeculectomy in patients who may have a high risk of developing conjunctival fibrosis. &quot;</field>
