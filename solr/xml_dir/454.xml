<field name="content">Simultaneous delivery of gene and chemotherapeutics via copolymeric micellar nanoparticles to overcome multiple drug resistance to promote synergistic tumor suppression.,&quot;Standard corneal collagen crosslinking (S-CXL) is a safe, approved procedure, but it may result in severe pain, early vision loss and possible complications, such as infectious or sterile keratitis, in some cases. We describe four cases of sterile infiltrates after uneventful S-CXL for keratoconus, from diagnosis to medical management with six months of follow-up, reporting their pathophysiological features, and comparing our findings with published reports. We discuss various possibilities for diagnosing sterile infiltration more rapidly. In terms of the pathophysiology of sterile infiltrate formation, we separated our patients into two types, one with sterile infiltrate from an antigen reaction and the other with sterile infiltrate due to excessive scarring. Early local steroid treatment resulted in a good visual outcome in our cases. &quot;</field>
