<field name="content">Available ablation energies to treat cT1 renal cell cancer: emerging technologies.,"Significant incidental findings reported on computed tomography (CT) scans are common. This article describes a 72-year-old man evaluated for possible bowel obstruction in whom was found a 3.1-cm x 2.6-cm centrally located enhancing mass in the left kidney highly suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Due to substantial medical comorbidities, the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate for either partial or complete nephrectomy. Interventional radiology was consulted for a minimally invasive ablation procedure. The large size and central location of the tumor involving the renal collecting system initially precluded definitive percutaneous cryoablation. Intra-arterial embolization was used as neoadjuvant therapy to decrease tumor burden. Fluoroscopy-guided bland embolization was performed targeting the arterial supply of the mass until stagnation of flow was achieved. A subsequent two-month post-embolization follow-up CT scan showed a 30% reduction in tumor size. Shrinkage of the mass from a central to a more peripheral location allowed for a cryoablation approach that would avoid damage to the vulnerable collecting system. Cryoablation was performed, and intraoperative CT demonstrated complete coverage of the tumor by the ice ball with no damage to the renal collecting system. A follow-up CT scan four years later showed no residual malignancy at the ablation site."
