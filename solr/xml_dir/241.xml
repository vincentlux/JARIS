<field name="content">&quot;Management of Dislocated Crystalline Lens With Vitrectomy, Perfluorocarbon Liquid, and Phacoemulsification, Combined With Modified Capsular Tension Ring and in-the-Bag Intraocular Lens Implantation.&quot;,&quot;With the rapid development of perinatology in China and the implementation of the two-child policy, the survival rate of premature and low weight infants is obviously improved, and the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants has been increasing year by year. ROP can lead to blindness when it is serious. It is the first cause of blindness of children in our country, and it is a heavy burden on family and society. With novel insights in the pathogenesis of the disease, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy has blated its way into ophthalmological practice and significantly changed the management of ROP. However, facing such promising drugs, we still need to take caution with the safety and long-time efficacy, investigate more reasonable dosing schedules and study the follow-up time. &lt;i&gt;(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55: 246-249)&lt;/i&gt;. &quot;</field>
