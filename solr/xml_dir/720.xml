<field name="content">Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes in age-related macular degeneration.,&quot;The present study describes a surgical technique for the management of complex dislocation and subluxation of the intraocular lens (IOL)-capsular bag (CB)-capsular tension ring (CTR) complex. During the procedure, one double-curved suture was inserted through the sclera into the posterior chamber, passing through the anterior capsules and then into the anterior chamber. The suture lines were pulled out from above and below the IOL-CB-CTR complex and a knot was tied 1 mm away from the corneoscleral incision. The IOL-CB-CTR complex was repositioned by adjusting the suture length. This novel method does not require explanting of the original IOL, allowing the IOL-CB-CTR complex to be immobilized in a simple and effective way. &quot;</field>
