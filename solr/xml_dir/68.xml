<field name="content">&quot;Irreversible electroporation and thermal ablation of tumors in the liver, lung, kidney and bone: What are the differences?&quot;,&quot;Image-guided thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with primary and secondary pulmonary malignancies. Modalities include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Although no large randomized studies exist comparing ablation to surgery or radiotherapy, numerous studies have reported safety and efficacy for the treatment of both primary and metastatic disease in select patients. Future studies will refine patient selection, procedural technique, and assessment for local recurrence and will evaluate long-term survival. &quot;</field>
