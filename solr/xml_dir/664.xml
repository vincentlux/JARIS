<field name="content">Interferon Alpha 2a and 2b in Ophthalmology: A Review.,&quot;Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) gain-of-function germline mutations are associated with diverse clinical manifestations, including autoimmune cytopenia, lymphadenopathy, immunodeficiency, endocrinopathy, and enteropathy. We describe a new feature: raised intracranial pressure with papilledema. Report of two cases. The first patient had a de novo heterozygous c.2144C&gt;T (p.Pro715Leu) mutation in the STAT3 gene. At age 1 she had papilledema with marked sheathing of the proximal vessels on the optic discs. Follow-up 8 years later showed chronic papilledema, cystoid macular edema, and vision loss. The second patient had a de novo heterozygous c.2147C&gt;T (p.Thr716Met) mutation. At age 12 he developed papilledema, which recurred despite treatment. In both patients, repeated sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Papilledema can occur as a manifestation of STAT3 gain-of-function mutation, sometimes accompanied by prominent vascular sheathing and cystoid macular edema. The mechanism may be chronic meningeal infiltration by white blood cells, impairing cerebrospinal fluid absorption. &quot;</field>
