<field name="content">Bilateral Acute Depigmentation of the Iris: Findings in Anterior Segment Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography.,&quot;ELOngation of Very Long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) is an elongase responsible for the biosynthesis of very long chain (VLC, C28) saturated (VLC-SFA) and polyunsaturated (VLC-PUFA) fatty acids in brain, retina, skin, Meibomian glands, and testes. Fascinatingly, different mutations in this gene have been reported to cause vastly different phenotypes in humans. Heterozygous inheritance of seven different mutations in the coding sequence and 5&apos; untranslated region of ELOVL4 causes autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3), while homozygous inheritance of three more mutant variants causes severe seizures with ichthyosis, hypertonia, and even death. Some recent studies have described heterozygous inheritance in yet another three mutant ELOVL4 variants, two that cause spinocerebellar ataxia-34 (SCA34) with erythrokeratodermia (EKV) and one that causes SCA34 without EKV. We identified the specific enzymatic reactions catalyzed by ELOVL4 and, using a variety of genetically engineered mouse models, have actively searched for the mechanisms by which ELOVL4 impacts neural function and health. In this review, we critically compare and contrast the various animal model and case studies involving ELOVL4 deficiency via either mutation or deletion, and the resulting consequences on neuronal health and function in both the retina and central nervous system. &quot;</field>
