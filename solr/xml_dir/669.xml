<field name="content">The identification of a RNA splice variant in TULP1 in two siblings with early-onset photoreceptor dystrophy.,&quot;&lt;i&gt;Wei&lt;/i&gt; \&apos;s triple nine needling therapy is the crucial acupuncture prescription in treatment of eye diseases in &lt;i&gt;Wei&lt;/i&gt; \&apos;s academic school of ophthalmology. &quot;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Wei&lt;/i&gt; \&apos;s triple nine needling therapy&quot;&quot; includes the three points near to the eyes, the three groups of points for penetrating acupuncture around the eyes and the acupoint selection based on the general differentiation of syndrome. In this paper, the acupoint selection and the thinking of acupoint combination were introduced in the treatment of optic nerve disease on the base of the theory of &quot;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Wei&lt;/i&gt; \&apos;s triple nine needling&quot;&quot; prescription. The specific needling manipulations at different regions involved in the triple needling procedure were explained in detail. It is proposed that the acupoints are combined and the correct needling manipulations selected rationally in compliance with the illness condition and the syndrome characteristics to ensure maximally the clinical effects of &quot;&quot;&lt;i&gt;Wei&lt;/i&gt; \&apos;s triple nine needling therapy&quot;&quot;. &quot;</field>
