<field name="content">A new subset of small stem cells in bovine bone marrow stromal cell populations.,&quot;SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF Related Matrix Associated Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin Subfamily B Member 1), also known as integrase interactor 1 (INI1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma, is a rare entity that was first described in 2014 (1). Since then, there have been 39 cases published in the literature, with basaloid or plasmacytoid/rhabdoid morphology being the most common pathological subtype (2). We report a patient with SMARCB1 (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma who had permanent vision loss after valsalva-induced acute hemorrhage and resultant orbital compartment syndrome. &quot;</field>
