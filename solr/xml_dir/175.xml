<field name="content">Implementations of 3D printing in ophthalmology.,&quot;Vitreomacular traction (VMT) is a disease in which the vitreous exerts abnormally strong traction on the macula, the area of the eye responsible for detailed central vision. If this traction significantly distorts the macula then VMT can lead to troublesome distorted vision (metamorphopsia), sometimes occurring despite relatively preserved visual acuity. Ocriplasmin, administered as a single intravitreal injection, aims to release VMT and improve vision. While the effect of ocriplasmin on traction release and visual acuity is well characterized, the effect of symptoms like metamorphopsia is not. A systematic review and synthesis of the literature on patient reported outcomes (PRO) in relation to the use of ocriplasmin for the treatment of VMT was undertaken using MED-LINE and Embase databases, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL). The review identified PRO data from 870 patients across three randomized controlled trials. The most commonly reported PROs were the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25), a broad measure of vision-related quality of life, and Visual Function Response (VFR), an outcome combining quality of life and visual acuity outcomes. Treatment with ocriplasmin produced significant patient benefit vs control (sham or placebo-injection). Ocriplasmin was associated with a higher proportion of patients experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in visual functioning with a difference of 11.8% for VFQ-25 and 23.2% for VFR responder analyses, respectively. Patients with VMT have material impairment in visual functioning and quality of life, relative to their reduction in visual acuity. Ocriplasmin results in a significant improvement in visual functioning. Future research could include the development of new PROs specific to VMT. &quot;</field>
