<field name="content">Late Ophthalmologic Referral of Anisometropic Amblyopia: A Retrospective Study of Different Amblyopia Subtypes.,&quot;The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the parafoveal cone density changes in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO). A total of 14 eyes of RP patients and 10 eyes of control subjects were examined. High-resolution images of cone photoreceptor cells were obtained with a Canon AO-SLO system in the four retinal regions of the superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal areas located 1.0mm from the central fovea. The relationships of cone density with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and the visual sensitivity of the static perimetry tests were analyzed in RP patients. The averaged cone densities in RP patients were decreased at 1.0mm eccentricity from the fovea (11,899cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) compared with those in control subjects (16,647cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; P&lt;0.01). The cone density was substantially decreased even in RP patients with an intact interdigitation zone at the examined area (12,865cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; P&lt;0.01 vs. controls) and preserved visual sensitivity with &gt;35dB (13,019cells/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; P&lt;0.001 vs. controls). In RP, cone photoreceptor cell loss occurred in the parafoveal region with a preserved EZ/IZ or visual sensitivity. AO-SLO may be a useful modality to detect early changes of cone photoreceptor cells in RP patients. &quot;</field>
