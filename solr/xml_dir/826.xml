<field name="content">Long-term outcome of full tendon vertical rectus transposition with Foster suture in unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy.,&quot;The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography (ERG) describes a minimum protocol for clinical testing but encourages additional ERG testing when appropriate. This ISCEV extended protocol describes methods to record and evaluate a light-adapted (LA) ERG stimulus-response series with increasing flash strengths. The LA ERG stimulus-response series (also referred to as the luminance-response or intensity-response series in the published literature) can characterise generalised cone system function more comprehensively than the ISCEV standard LA ERGs alone. The amplitude of LA ERG a-waves, arising from cones and cone off-bipolar cells, typically shows a saturating function. The LA ERG b-wave amplitudes, which arise primarily from activity of retinal bipolar cells, show an amplitude peak followed by a nonzero plateau (the &quot;&quot;photopic hill&quot;&quot; phenomenon). This ISCEV extended protocol specifies a stimulus-response series suitable to evaluate generalised dysfunction affecting the LA retina, to aid in distinguishing between the on- and off-responses of the cone system and to monitor ERG changes in these characteristics. The LA ERG stimulus-response series for a- and b-waves is recorded to a sequence of nine flash stimuli ranging from 0.03 to 300cdsm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, superimposed on a standard background of 30cdm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. A shorter protocol is also presented to measure the mid-range of the function (the &quot;&quot;photopic hill&quot;&quot;) using 5 flash stimuli. &quot;</field>
