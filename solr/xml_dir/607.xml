<field name="content">Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography for Evaluating the Lamina Cribrosa A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.,&quot;The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vitreous reflux and its amount on short-term intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. The study included 316 eyes of 276 patients. Intraocular pressures were measured before intravitreal injection (preIOP), immediately after intravitreal injection (postIOP0), and 30min after intravitreal injection (postIOP30). The amount of vitreous reflux was evaluated by measuring conjunctival bleb diameter, and patients were grouped as; group 1: no vitreous reflux, group 2: less vitreous reflux, and group 3: more vitreous reflux. The data were analyzed using variance analysis, chi-square test, and regression analysis. PostIOP0 values were highest in group 1, followed by group 2 and group 3 (all p values&lt;0.001). PostIOP30 values were similar in group 1 and group 2 (p=0.261), but were lower in group 3 than other two groups (p&lt;0.001, p=0.001, respectively). Vitreous reflux was identified as the only factor affecting postinjection intraocular pressure changes (p&lt;0.001), and a negative correlation was found between the total number of intravitreal injection and vitreous reflux (p=0.032). The major factor affecting short-term postinjection intraocular pressure elevation was vitreous reflux, and intraocular pressure levels increased as the amount of vitreous reflux decreased. Vitreous reflux and its amount decreased as the total number of intravitreal injection increased. &quot;</field>
