<field name="content">[Can Big Data change our practices?],&quot;To report a case of ocular cystinosis diagnosed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and histopathology. A 67-year-old man who presented with eye pain was found to have unilateral corneal crystal deposition. Ocular cystinosis was diagnosed by histopathology, AS-OCT, and lack of renal involvement of the disease. AS-OCT showed hyperreflective densities in the corneal epithelium. The patient underwent superficial keratectomy given irregular astigmatism prior to cataract surgery. Electron microscopy of the corneal scrapings revealed epithelial cells with intracystoplasmic membrane-bound crystals confirming the diagnosis of cystinosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ocular cystinosis involving strictly the epithelial layer of the cornea that has been imaged by AS-OCT. &quot;</field>
