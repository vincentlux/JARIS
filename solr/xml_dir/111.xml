<field name="content">Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 14Patients with Congenital Oculomotor Nerve Palsy.,&quot;To test the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the outer retina (OR = distance from external limiting membrane to the retinal pigment epithelium-choroid boundary) can be detected by using antioxidants (AOs) to correct an impaired light-evoked response as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). C57BL/6J mice were maintained in the dark for 20 hours and studied by OCT before and after 1 hour of light exposure. OR thickness in dark or light was measured, and the light-dark difference (i.e., the photoresponse) was calculated. Subgroups of mice were given either saline or d-cis-diltiazem (an inducer of transient and nondamaging OR oxidative stress)  methylene blue (24 hours before examination) and -lipoic acid (1 hour before examination); one group was kept only in the dark and given only AOs. In uninjected or saline-injected control mice, the OR showed a similar and reproducible light-induced expansion; dark-adapted mice given AOs did not increase dark-adapted OR thickness. The d-cis-diltiazem-treated mice had no photoresponse (P &gt; 0.05). The d-cis-diltiazem-treated mice given AOs corrected (P &lt; 0.05) the suppressed OR photoresponse, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. QUEnch-assiSTed (QUEST) OCT reproduced results from previous gold standard assays, showing that oxidative stress impairs the OR photoresponse and that d-cis-diltiazem produces OR oxidative stress. We envision future applications of QUEST OCT in a range of oxidative stress-based retinopathies. &quot;</field>
