<field name="content">Five-year outcomes of retinal vein occlusion treated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors.,&quot;We investigate morphologic and physiologic alterations of ganglion cells (GCs) in a streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. Experiments were conducted in flat-mount retinas of mice 3 months after the induction of diabetes. Changes in morphology of four subtypes of GCs (ON-type RGA2 [ON-RGA2], OFF-type RGA2 [OFF-RGA2], ON-type RGC1 [ON-RGC1], and ON-OFF type RGD2 [ON-OFF RGD2]) were characterized in Thy1-YFP transgenic mice. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, passive membrane properties and action potential (AP) firing properties were further investigated in transient ON- and OFF-RGA2 cells. Morphologic parameters were significantly altered in the dendrites branching in the ON sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) for ON-RGA2 cells and ON-OFF RGD2 cells. Much less significant changes, if any, were seen in those arborizing in the OFF sublamina of the IPL for OFF-RGA2 and ON-OFF RGD2 cells. No detectable changes in morphology were seen in RGC1 cells. Electrophysiologically, increased resting membrane potentials and decreased membrane capacitance were found in transient ON-RGA2 cells, but not in transient OFF-RGA2 cells. Similar alterations in AP firing properties, such as an increase in AP width and reduction in maximum spiking rate, were shared by these two subtypes. Furthermore, in response to depolarizing current injections, both cells generated more APs suggesting an enhanced excitability of these cells in diabetic conditions. These differential changes in morphology and electrophysiology in subtypes of GCs may be responsible for reduced contrast sensitivity known to occur during the early stage of diabetic retinopathy. &quot;</field>
