<field name="content">&quot;The route of the visual receptor, rhodopsin, along the cilium.&quot;,&quot;Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) may occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, little is known about its incidence, strategies for ophthalmic surveillance, and timely implementation of adequate antiviral treatment in pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. We provide a retrospective analysis of the epidemiology and clinical features of CMVR in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients transplanted at our center over a 16-year period. Two patients of this cohort with leukemia are presented. Our analysis is supplemented by a systematic review on pediatric patients with leukemia and CMVR in the setting of allogeneic HSCT. The overall incidence of CMVR in our cohort was 1% (4/338) and 14.2% (3/21) in leukemic patients. In published cases, CMVR occurred at a median of 143 days after transplantation, and, in the majority of patients, was preceded by CMV detection in blood by a median of 93 days. Continued immune suppression following engraftment likely triggers CMVR. Pre-emptive treatment with ganciclovir as standard is usually successful. Foscarnet is used in case of resistance to ganciclovir or drug-induced granulocytopenia. Overall, CMVR after HSCT in pediatric leukemic patients is rare, but a potentially higher vulnerability of this population for involvement of the eye warrants a standardized ophthalmological examination plan.
