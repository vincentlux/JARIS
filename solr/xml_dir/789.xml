<field name="content">Positive allosteric modulation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor reduces the signs and symptoms of Huntington&apos;s disease in the R6/2 mouse model.,&quot;Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common causes of blindness in developed countries. Due to its asymptomatic onset and progressive disease course, DR is typically diagnosed at a late stage when treatment options are limited and therefore often results in irreversible blindness. Studies have demonstrated that carnosine may prevent and treat DR. In a previous study, the positive effect of carnosine on DR was determined and it was revealed that there may be an association between carnosine and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. To assess the interaction between carnosine and the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, changes in PKC, ERK and p-ERK expression was assessed in diabetic rats following treatment with carnosine, PD98059 or U46619 via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results demonstrated that the expression of ERK and p-ERK were significantly suppressed following treatment with carnosine, but no significant effect on the expression of PKC was identified, which indicates that suppressing the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway may serve an important role in carnosine-induced DR prevention and treatment. &quot;</field>
