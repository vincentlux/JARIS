<field name="content">Temporal changes in MRI appearance of the prostate after focal ablation.,&quot;The present report describes a case of cryotherapy ablation in a 35-year-old woman with a 1.5cm painful venous malformation (VM) in the right vastus lateralis muscle. After the patient had failed sclerotherapy, a single session of cryotherapy was performed that resulted in both technical and clinical success. At 8-month follow-up, there was no residual pain. The use of cryotherapy ablation for the treatment of an intramuscular VM has only been previously described on 1 occasion. Based on our results, cryotherapy is a promising therapy for fast and safe treatment for patients with venous vascular malformations.&quot;</field>
