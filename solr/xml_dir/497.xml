<field name="content">Comparison of cytokine/chemokine levels in aqueous humor of primary open-angle glaucoma patients with positive or negative outcome following trabeculectomy.,&quot;We aimed to compare clinical and pathological reactions towards locally synthesized bovine bone derived from hydroxyapatite (bonedocosahexaenoic acid (dHA)) and commercially available porous polyethylene (Medpor, Porex SurgicalIncorporation, Georgia, USA) orbital implants in animal models. An experimental study was performed on 14 New Zealand white rabbits. Group A (n=7) was implanted with bovine bone dHA and group B (n=7) was implanted with Medpor. Clinical examinations were performed on Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 post-implantation. The implanted eyes were enucleated on Day 42 and were sent for pathological evaluation. Serial clinical examinations included urine color and odor; feeding and physical activity demonstrated normal wellbeing in all the subjects. Localized minimal infection was observed in both groups during the first two weeks following implantation, and the subjects responded well to topical moxifloxacin. Both groups exhibited evidence of wound breakdown. No signs of implant migration or extrusion were observed in either group. The histopathological examination revealed no statistically significant difference in inflammatory cell reactions and fibrovascular tissue maturation between both types of implants. However, all (100%) of the bovine bone dHA implants displayed complete fibrovascular ingrowth compared to Medpor implants (57.1%) at six weeks post-implantation (p=0.001). In conclusion, bovine bone dHA and Medpor orbital implants were well-tolerated clinically and displayed similar inflammatory reactions and fibrovascular tissue maturation. Locally synthesized bovine bone dHA orbital implants displayed significantly greater complete fibrovascular ingrowth in comparison with Medpor implants. &quot;</field>
