<field name="content">Diagnostic test accuracy of diabetic retinopathy screening by physician graders using a hand-held non-mydriatic retinal camera at a tertiary level medical clinic.,&quot;Hirayama disease is a rare neurological disease affecting primarily men in the second to third decades. To date there are only few reports from Italy. We report the case of three young basketball players who presented with clinical, electrophysiological and MRI findings suggestive for Hirayama disease. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, several hypotheses have been suggested and two of these are the disproportionate growth of cervical spine and cervical cord/roots during adolescence and the chronic traumatism. We think that, in our cases, the height of basketball players combined with the constant stress caused by the sport, could have contributed to the development of the Hirayama disease. With this report we would stress the importance to be careful to consider this pathology in order to avoid misdiagnosis predictive of poor prognosis in young patients. &quot;</field>
