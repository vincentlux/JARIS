<field name="content">MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF THE RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM AND ASSOCIATED CHORIORETINAL CHARACTERISTICS IN EYES WITH EARLY AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION AND SUBRETINAL DRUSENOID DEPOSITS.,&quot;To analyze features of the choriocapillaris in eyes with earlier stages of pachychoroid spectrum, this study included 46 eyes with PPE, 32 age-matched eyes with pachychoroid without epitheliopathy, and 30 normal controls. Macular 33 mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomography. Vascular density and signal void area in the choriocapillaris were analyzed. Topographical correlation of signal voids with the dilated choroidal large vessel (pachyvessel) was assessed. Choriocapillaris vascular density was significantly lower in eyes with PPE compared with controls (p=0.003). The number, the total area and the average size of signal voids was the highest in the PPE group followed by the pachychoroid without epitheliopathy and then controls (all p0.001). 89.0% signal void area colocalized with pachyvessels. The average size of the signal void was higher if it was colocalized with pachyvessel (p&lt;0.001). In conclusion, the area of flow impairment in the choriocapillaris was increased in eyes with pachychoroid and even greater when epitheliopathy was present. Pachyvessel was associated with choriocapillaris flow impairment by location and size. &quot;</field>
