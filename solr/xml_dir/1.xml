<field name="content">Cryotherapy for nodal metastasis in NSCLC with acquired resistance to immunotherapy.,"Novel approaches with checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapy continue to be essential in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the low rate of primary response and the development of acquired resistance during the immunotherapy limit their long-term effectiveness. The underlying cause of acquired resistance is poorly understood; potential management strategies for patients with acquired resistance are even less clear. Here, we report the case of a 75-year-old female smoker with cough, fatigue, and weight loss that was found to have an 8.6cm right upper lobe lung lesion with local invasion, adenopathy, and a malignant pericardial effusion. This lesion was biopsied and identified to be cT3N3M1b squamous cell cancer of the lung without any recognizable PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. For her metastatic NSCLC, the patient underwent two lines of conventional chemotherapy before initiation of combination immunotherapy with an anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Though she initially achieved a response, she thereafter progressed and developed immunotherapy resistant lymph nodal metastasis. While cervical lymph nodes could be surgically removed, another metastasis in an aortocaval area required a more sensitive therapy like thermal ablation. The aortocaval node was partially treated with a single treatment of cryotherapy and demonstrated durable complete response. Cryotherapy for checkpoint immunotherapy resistant metastasis appears to be a safe and feasible treatment for treating metastatic disease in non-small cell lung cancer. The prospect of cryotherapy adjuvancy may enable local control of metastatic disease after initial response to immune checkpoint immunotherapy and may impact on overall outcomes."
