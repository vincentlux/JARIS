<field name="content">A case of X-linked retinoschisis with atypical fundus appearance.,&quot;Mutations in the RS1 gene are known to cause retinoschisis, an X-linked hereditary retinal degeneration. Here, we present a case of atypical retinoschisis with clinical findings of retinoschisis and retinitis pigmentosa. This report is an observational case report. The detailed ophthalmological examinations included visual field determination, multimodal imaging and electrophysiological recordings. Targeted next-generation sequencing of a retinal disease gene panel was performed. The 55-year-old male, highly hyperopic patient, presented with a best-corrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/100 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. In the kinetic visual field, there was a superior scotoma, as well as a ring scotoma in the inferior hemisphere in the right eye and a concentric visual field constriction to 10 in the left eye. Funduscopy revealed marked pigmentary changes (i.e. bone spicules) in the mid-periphery bilaterally and symmetrically, as well as two small intra-retinal haemorrhages in the left eye. Full-field electroretinography recordings showed extinguished rod and cone responses. Diagnostic-genetic testing revealed a hemizygous missense mutation in the RS1 gene (c.305G&gt;A; p.Arg102Gln) was identified. We present a case of atypical retinoschisis with clinical findings of retinitis pigmentosa. &quot;</field>
