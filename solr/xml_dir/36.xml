<field name="content">Morphometric analysis in mouse scleral fibroblasts using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy.,&quot;Idiopathic full-thickness macular hole is a severe visual impairment disease. Pars plana vitrectomy remains the primary treatment option for idiopathic full-thickness macular holes, and over 90% idiopathic full-thickness macular holes are closed by vitrectomy surgery. However, the full-thickness macular hole may close spontaneously, with a good visual acuity progress. Since recent studies are small-sample studies and case reports, the characteristics for spontaneous closure of idiopathic full-thickness macular holes are not fully understood. Here, we review the articles in PubMed database from 1999 to 2018 and discuss the characteristic and the risk factors, especially OCT structure features, for spontaneous closure of idiopathic full-thickness macular holes. &quot;</field>
