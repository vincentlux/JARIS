<field name="content">Incidence of Post-ablation Syndrome Following Image-Guided Percutaneous Cryoablation of Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Prospective Study.,&quot;Image-guided percutaneous, minimally invasive ablation techniques offer a wide variety of new modalities to treat tumors in some of the most medically complicated patients coming to our hospitals. The use of computed tomography, PET, ultrasound imaging, and MRI to guide radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation techniques now makes it possible to treat patients on a short stay or outpatient basis with very good immediate outcomes. This rapid expansion of new tumor ablation techniques often presents challenges for the non-operating room anesthesia team. Collaboration and communication between the radiologist and anesthesiologist are key to safety and excellent patient outcomes. &quot;</field>
