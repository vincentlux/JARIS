<field name="content">Considerations Regarding The Relationship Between Anticoagulants Intake And Glaucoma Prognosis In Eyes With Optic Disc Hemorrhages.,&quot;To evaluate the effect of autologous serum eyedrops treatment on corneal expression of the MUC5AC in patients with limbal deficiency. A prospective and comparative interventional case series study of 42 eyes of 21 patients was performed before and 8 weeks after treatment with autologous serum. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic assessment of the tear film and ocular surface, corneal impression cytology (IC) and MUC5AC detection by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-one of the 42 eyes studied were available for both conventional cytology and MUC5AC analysis prior to and after treatment. Differences between outcomes obtained by impression cytology and MUC5AC detection were found in 9 of 82 samples (11%). We found changes in the corneal expression of MUC5AC after treatment in 19 of 41 eyes (46.3%): 18 of them (94.7%) changed from positive to negative expression, and 1 eye (5.3%) changed from negative to positive MUC5AC expression after autologous serum eyedrops. These changes were related with the corneal involvement prior to treatment (15 of them (78.9%) occurred in patients with slight corneal involvement), and with the improvement in the degree of squamous metaplasia after treatment (P=0.001 and P=0.003 respectively). The treatment significantly improved tear stability, squamous metaplasia and subjective patient perception. Autologous serum eyedrops treatment diminished the corneal expression of MUC5AC mainly in patients with slight corneal involvement before treatment. &quot;</field>
