<field name="content">Decision Making: Thermal Ablation Options for Small Renal Masses.,"The management of small renal masses has become an important public health topic. The increased use of cross-sectional imaging and ultrasound has led to a downward stage migration for the detection of small renal masses. Cancer-specific survival, however, has not reflected this trend accordingly. Although partial nephrectomy has been the mainstay of treatment of small renal masses less than 4cm, there is growing interest in ablative therapies, such as cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation, due to decreased morbidity. Oncologic outcomes are limited by methodology and length of follow-up, but short-term recurrence rates are low."
