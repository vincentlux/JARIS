<field name="content">Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study: Intraocular Pressure Measurements Found in a Population at High Risk for Glaucoma.,&quot;Along with the wide investigation activities in developing carbon-based, metal-free catalysts to replace precious metal (e.g., Pt) catalysts for various green energy devices, carbon nanomaterials have also shown great potential for biorelated applications. This article provides a focused, critical review on the recent advances in these emerging research areas. The structure-property relationship and mechanistic understanding of recently developed carbon-based, metal-free catalysts for chemical/biocatalytic reactions will be discussed along with the challenges and perspectives in this exciting field, providing a look forward for the rational design and fabrication of new carbon-based, metal-free catalysts with high activities, remarkable selectivity, and outstanding durability for various energy-related/biocatalytic processes. &quot;</field>
