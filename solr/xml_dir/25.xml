<field name="content">Novel variants and phenotypes widen the phenotypic spectrum of GABRG2-related disorders.,&quot;Nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with aptamers have been extensively in recent years, which can efficiently target cancer cells that improve the therapeutic effect. Aptamers (Apt) are small oligonucleotide molecule ligands have specific high-affinity. In this work, we developed a PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with doxorubicin. The NPs were modified with C2NP , a ssDNA aptamer specifically binding to CD30 protein which was over expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells. PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were formed by nanoprecipitation and loaded with doxorubicin, further conjugated C2NP aptamer via an EDC/NHS technique. Obtained results demonstrated that the targeted agent was successfully conjugated confirming by Urea PAGE and XPS. The physicochemical properties of Apt-DOX-NPs like particle size at 168.072.72 nm and zeta potential at -30.760.153 mV. The time of the release drugs was efficiently increased in targeted formulations and showed higher accumulation in ALCL cells than non-targeted system. Findings from this work demonstrated the potential efficacy of C2NP-functionalized nanoparticles for a therapy in ALCL. &quot;</field>
