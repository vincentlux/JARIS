<field name="content">Orthokeratology With a New Contact Lens Design in Hyperopia: A Pilot Study.,&quot;An increasing number of surgical strabismus patients are taking oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, with more diverse mechanisms of action than those used in the past. The decision as to whether to continue these drugs throughout the perioperative period is difficult and must be based on the balance between hemorrhagic and thrombotic risk. To help guide strabismus surgeons with clinical management in these cases, we review potential hemorrhagic complications of strabismus surgery and examine the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during the perioperative period. Surgical strategies that might help minimize intraoperative hemorrhage in patients on anticoagulant therapy are also discussed. &quot;</field>
