<field name="content">Tyrosinase (TYR) gene sequencing and literature review reveals recurrent mutations and multiple population founder gene mutations as causative of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in Pakistani families.,&quot;Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a multifaceted cytokine that functions in both angiogenesis and inflammation. A proangiogenic state has been found in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), mainly because of elevated Ang-2 levels. We determined Ang-2 level in 40 children and adolescents with SCD compared with 40 healthy controls and assessed its relation to retinopathy as well as carotid intimamedia thickness (CIMT). Hematological profile, serum ferritin, and serum Ang-2 were measured. CIMT was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound. Fundus examination was performed followed by fundus fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to find small vascular changes not clinically manifested. Ang-2 levels and CIMT were significantly higher in SCD patients compared with controls. The incidence of nonproliferative retinopathy was 45%. SCD patients with retinopathy were older in age with a history of sickling crisis of &gt;3 attacks per year and had a higher incidence of sickle cell anemia than sickle -thalassemia. Ang-2 cutoff value 9000pg/mL could significantly detect the presence of retinopathy among SCD patients with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Serum Ang-2 levels were positively correlated with HbS and CIMT. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Ang-2 and HbS significantly contribute to retinopathy among patients with SCD. Elevated Ang-2 highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of SCD and may be considered a promising marker for screening of patients at risk of sickle retinopathy and vascular dysfunction. &quot;</field>
