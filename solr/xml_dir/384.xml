<field name="content">Diagnostic occlusion test for acquired esotropia.,&quot;Optic nerve injury is a severe complication of traumatic brain injury, which may lead to permanent and potentially loss of vision. Arbutin (ARB) is a natural hydroquinone glycoside, has been widely utilized to treat pigmented disorders. However, the role of ARB in optic nerve injury is still unclear. The study attempted to explore the effect of ARB on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced oxidative injury in RGCs. RGCs were treated with different concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to construct a cell oxidative injury model. Subsequently, the effects of ARB on these injured cells were examined through testing cell viability, apoptosis and their associated factors. MicroRNA-29a (miR-29a) inhibitor was transfected into RGCs, and the regulatory effect of miR-29a inhibition on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-injured cells was detected. Further, the important signaling pathways of MEK/ERK and p38MAPK were determined to uncover the underlying mechanism. We firstly used H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to induce RGCs injury, and subsequent experiments found that ARB significantly alleviated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-induced cell injury in RGCs by promoting cell viability, reducing apoptosis, and regulating the protein levels of cell growth-associated factors. Increasing expression of miR-29a was observed in ARB and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; treated cells. Moreover, miR-29a inhibition significantly abrogated the protective effect of ARB on H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-injured RGCs. NRAS was predicated as a direct target gene of miR-29a. Mechanistically, ARB blocked MEK/ERK and p38MAPK pathways by up-regulating miR-29a. These data demonstrated that ARB protected RGCs against oxidative injury induced by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through blocking MEK/ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways by up-regulation of miR-29a. &quot;</field>
