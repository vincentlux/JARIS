<field name="content">Ocular surface evaluation in pediatric Hashimoto&apos;s thyroiditis without thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.,&quot;The main inconvenience of conventional eye drops is the rapid washout of the drugs due to nasolacrimal drainage or ophthalmic barriers. The ocular drug bioavailability can be improved by either prolonging retention time in the cul-de-sac or by increasing the ocular permeability. The focus of this review is to highlight some chitosan-based drug delivery approaches that proved to have good clinical efficacy and high potential for use in ophthalmology. They are exemplified by recent studies exploring in-depth the techniques and mechanisms in order to improve ocular bioavailability of the active substances. Used alone or in combination with other compounds with synergistic action, chitosan enables ocular retention time and corneal permeability. Associated with other stimuli-responsive polymers, it enhances the mechanical strength of the gels. Chitosan and its derivatives increase drug permeability through the cornea by temporarily opening tight junctions between epithelial cells. Different types of chitosan-based colloidal systems have the potential to overcome the ocular barriers without disturbing the vision process. Chitosan also plays a key role in improving corneal wound healing by stimulating the migration of keratinocytes when it is used alone or in combination with other compounds with synergistic action. &quot;</field>
