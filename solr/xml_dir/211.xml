<field name="content">Identification of prothymosin alpha (PTMA) as a biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by label-free quantitative proteomics and Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB).,&quot;Optical coherence tomography angiography is a relatively new, noninvasive technology that has revolutionized imaging of the retinal and choroidal microvasculature. This technology is based on the detection of movement or changes that represent moving red cells in sequential optical coherence tomography scans. As with other established imaging technologies, it has unique benefits as well as certain disadvantages, which include a limited field of view and vulnerability to imaging artifacts. However, software and hardware improvements are continually evolving to mitigate these limitations. Optical coherence tomography angiography has been used to gain a better understanding of microvascular changes across a spectrum of ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinal vein occlusions. In this article, we review algorithms and techniques commonly utilized in optical coherence tomography angiography systems and compare optical coherence tomography angiography to fluorescein angiography, the current gold standard for imaging the retinal vasculature. In addition, we provide an overview of important optical coherence tomography angiography findings in a variety of ocular diseases. Although the clinical role of this technology is still poorly defined, optical coherence tomography angiography has the potential to become an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of vascular pathologies. &quot;</field>
