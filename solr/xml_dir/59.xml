<field name="content">Freezing Fort Knox: Mesenteric Carcinoid Cryoablation.,"Here, we report our experience in treating painful plantar fibromas with percutaneous cryoablation. We retrospectively identified patients with symptomatic plantar fibromas who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation between June 2014 and June 2015. In total, four patients (two male, two female) with five plantar fibromas undergoing a total of seven ablation procedures were identified. Each procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a single freeze-thaw cycle. The electronic medical record, procedure reports, and pain scores from a brief pain inventory administered before and after treatment were reviewed. Average and worst pain in 24h, and time to peak symptom improvement post-procedure were compared. Complications were reviewed using the SIR classification. Five plantar fibromas were treated (mean size 2.21.6cm). Four of five lesions were present for more than 6years, and 1/5 was present for less than 1year. Surgical excision was previously performed on 3/5 lesions, all with short-term recurrence. Mean worst pain score in 24h and average pain score in 24h (scale of 10) at initial evaluation were 7.11.8 and 5.81.9, reduced after cryoablation to 0.80.8 and 0.40.6, respectively. Average time to symptom improvement was 2.80.98weeks (range 2-4weeks). All patients reported improved ambulation and weight-bearing, and complete cessation of pain medication after treatment. The improvement was sustained on follow-up at 12months. No major complications occurred. Minor complications occurred in 3/5 patients. Early experience with percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation to treat painful plantar fibromas suggests that it is a safe and effective treatment option, with early and near-complete symptom improvement."
