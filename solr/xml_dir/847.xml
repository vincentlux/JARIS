<field name="content">Short-term anterior chamber inflammation in phacoemulsification with and without Ex-Press glaucoma implant.,&quot;Variants in the ABCA4 gene are causal for a variety of retinal dystrophy phenotypes, including Stargardt disease (STGD1). However, 15% of patients who present with symptoms compatible with STGD1/ABCA4 disease do not have identifiable causal ABCA4 variants. We hypothesized that a case-control collapsing analysis in ABCA4-negative patients with compatible symptoms would provide an objective measure to identify additional disease genes. We performed a genome-wide enrichment analysis of &quot;&quot;qualifying variants&quot;&quot;-ultrarare variants predicted to impact protein function-in protein-coding genes in 79 unrelated cases and 9028 unrelated controls. Despite modest sample size, two known retinal dystrophy genes, PRPH2 and CRX, achieved study-wide significance (p&lt;1.3310&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt;) under a dominant disease model, and eight additional known retinal dystrophy genes achieved nominal significance (p&lt;0.05). Across these ten genes, the excess of qualifying variants explained up to 36.8% of affected individuals. Furthermore, under a recessive model, the cone-rod dystrophy gene CERKL approached study-wide significance. Our results indicate that case-control collapsing analyses can efficiently identify pathogenic variants in genes in non-ABCA4 retinal dystrophies. The genome-wide collapsing analysis framework is an objective discovery method particularly suitable in settings with overlapping disease phenotypes. &quot;</field>
