<field name="content">Post-Concussion: Receded Near Point of Convergence is Not Diagnostic of Convergence Insufficiency.,&quot;Corneal neovascularization (CNV), a pathological process of angiogenesis, can lead to serious consequences in the cornea. CNV is generally proved to associate with inflammation in the cornea closely, which is mainly elicited by the disruption of equilibrium between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. Angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGFs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are vital factors in the formation of CNV. Especially VEGFs are convinced to be the core angiogenic factors in CNV, and MMPs are proved to exert dual effects on the process. Strikingly, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are determined to play key roles in the formation of CNV, while the mechanism is still vague. In this review, the latest researches are reviewed to discuss the role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CNV respectively and some inhibitors of them are presented. We hope to provide a new direction of drug research for CNV. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. &quot;</field>
