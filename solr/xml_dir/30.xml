<field name="content">Current Technique and Application of Percutaneous Cryotherapy.,"To investigate the effects of pirfenidone (PFD) on post-cryoablation inflammation in a mouse model. In this IACUC-approved study, eighty Balb/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (20/group): sham+vehicle, sham+PFD, cryoablation+vehicle, and cryoablation+PFD. For cryoablation groups, a 20% freeze rate cryoablation (20s to less than -100C) was used to ablate normal muscle in the right flank. For sham groups, the cryoprobe was advanced into the flank and maintained for 20s without ablation. PFD or vehicle solution was intraperitoneally injected (5mg/kg) at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and then every other day until day 13 after cryoablation. Mice were euthanized at days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Blood samples were used for serum IL-6, IL-10, and TGF1 analysis using electrochemiluminescence and ELISA assays, respectively. Immunohistochemistry-stained ablated tissues were used to analyze macrophage infiltration and local TGF1 expression in the border region surrounding the cryoablation-induced coagulation zone. Cryoablation induced macrophage infiltration and increased TGF1 expression in the border of the necrotic zone, and high levels of serum IL-6, peaking at days 7 (70.58.46/HPF), 14 (22818.36/HPF), and 7 (298.6792.63), respectively. Animals receiving PFD showed reduced macrophage infiltration (35.516.93/HPF at day 7, p<0.01) and cytokine levels (60.27.6/HPF at day 14, p<0.01). PFD also significantly reduced serum IL-6 levels (p<0.001 vs. all non-PFD groups). PFD mitigates cryoablation induced muscle tissue macrophage infiltration, increased IL-6 levels, and local TGF1 expression in a small animal model."
