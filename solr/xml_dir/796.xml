<field name="content">&quot;Influence of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine on postoperative quality of recovery following a single bolus dose of rocuronium: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study.&quot;,&quot;Unwanted hair is an important aesthetic problem in many cultures. Laser epilation devices have become commonly available at the present time. Nowadays, laser hair removal is widely practiced as a cosmetic procedure, however, some ocular complications may occur. The retina is the most vulnerable to laser-related injury which can lead to serious visual impairment. Laser epilation can cause serious complications and medical costs if not performed carefully and appropriately. The use of laser hair removal devices by unskilled aestheticians who is untrained and do not have the proper protective equipment at the beauty centers, can cause serious ophthalmological and psychological disorders and thus substantial labour productivity loss and economic loss. Therefore, the protective eyewear must be used by both the aesthetician and the patient during the procedure of laser epilation. In this way, we can improve the safety of both patients and aestheticians and at the same time ensure their healths. I reported the case of a 49-year-old female with a unilateral maculopathy responsible for an acute visual field defect and consecutive psychological depression secondary to Alexandrite laser epilation. This report is important to raise the awareness of ophthalmology and dermatology society and public about risks of their misuse. &quot;</field>
