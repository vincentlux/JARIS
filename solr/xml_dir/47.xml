<field name="content">Trans-rectal Ultrasound-Guided Autologous Blood Injection in the Interprostatorectal Space Prior to Percutaneous MRI-Guided Cryoablation of the Prostate.,"To prospectively evaluate the incidence of post-ablation syndrome (fever and flu-like symptoms) and impact on the quality of life in the first 10days following percutaneous image-guided cryoablation for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A prospective study of all cryoablation procedures with biopsy proven RCC was conducted with institutional review board approval between 08/2012 and 04/2016. Sixty-four patients (43 males and 21 females) underwent cryoablation. Mean age was 68 (range 24-86). A telephone questionnaire survey was conducted on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 following cryoablation, and complications were recorded. Data collected included temperature, degree of flu-like symptoms, severity of pain, percentage of pain relief with analgesics, interference with general activity and with work (graded on a 0-10 Numeric Intensity Scale). Following cryoablation, six patients (9%) out of 64 developed post-ablation syndrome. Thirty-three patients (52%) developed flu-like symptoms only, which completely resolved by day 10 in 25 patients (39%). One patient had pyrexia only, which was self- limiting by day 10. Twenty-four patients (38%) were asymptomatic. Pain (mean score=2.1) and interference on general activities (mean score=1.8) and work (mean score=2) following cryoablation peaked on day 3 and improved subsequently. Forty-six patients (72%) had 90-100% pain relief by day 10. No major complications were observed. The full spectrum of post-ablation syndrome following cryoablation occurs in approximately 9% of patients; however, 61% of patients experience flu-like symptoms in the first 10days, which are self-limiting."
