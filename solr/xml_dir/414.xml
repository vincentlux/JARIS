<field name="content">&quot;Sensitivity and Specificity of Potential Diagnostic Features Detected Using Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography, and Fluorescein Angiography for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.&quot;,&quot;von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in formation of multiple systemic tumors. Juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma (JRCH) is one of the major manifestations in VHL disease; however, treatments are challenging, especially in children. The present study reports the case of a 6-year-old girl with suspected VHL disease presenting with JRCH. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated marked dye leakage from the tumor. Retinal hemorrhage occurred around the tumor 7 months later. Laser photocoagulation of the tumor tissue was safely and successfully conducted without general anesthesia. The hemorrhage diminished after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated mild resolution of an elevated lesion in JRCH with contraction of the vitreoretinal interface over the tumor. Laser photocoagulation may be considered the first-line treatment for young patients with JRCH, although the primary physicians must have the necessary skills and be able to establish good doctor-patient relationships, even with children. &quot;</field>
