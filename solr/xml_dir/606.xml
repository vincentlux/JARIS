<field name="content">Unbiased Pathogen Detection and Host Gene Profiling for Conjunctivitis.,&quot;Purpose/Aim: This study evaluated the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension for treating chronic allergic conjunctival disease with and without atopic dermatitis. This study was conducted as a prospective observational post-market survey. Our large-scale study protocol was accepted by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan and included patients who were prescribed topical tacrolimus for the treatment of chronic allergic conjunctival disease from May 2008 to Aug 2010 in Japan. Topical tacrolimus was instilled 2 times daily for 6months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in papillae-limbus-cornea clinical signs score (based on the presence of papillae, giant papillae, Trantas&apos; dots, limbal swelling, and corneal epithelial signs). Remission rate following topical tacrolimus treatment was investigated using generalized estimating equations. A total of 1821 subjects were included in the analyses. Six months into treatment, 83.0% and 87.7% of subjects with and without atopic dermatitis, respectively, were in remission (based on the papillae-limbus-cornea grading score). Topical tacrolimus treatment was equally effective in improving papillae-limbus-cornea grading scores from baseline in both study groups after 6months of treatment. Additionally, the odds ratio for remission increased over time. The concomitant use of topical steroids improved papillae-limbus-cornea grading scores, including papillary signs with a statistically significant, but low odds ratio. Tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension is useful for treating chronic allergic conjunctival disease with and without atopic dermatitis. Clinical response to local tacrolimus therapy is dependent upon treatment duration. &quot;</field>
