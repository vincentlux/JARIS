<field name="content">Pupil cerclage technique for treatment of traumatic mydriasis.,&quot;Interferon alpha (IFN-) is a glycoprotein with antitumor, antiviral, and immunomodulatory activity, used widely in the treatment of viral infections (hepatitis B and C, condylomata acuminata, herpes zoster, etc.), hematological disorders (leukemia, multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma, and essential thrombocythemia), and solid tumors (clear cell carcinoma in the metastatic stage, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cervical neoplasia). Studies have proven the effectiveness of IFN- in the treatment of ophthalmic disorders involving the anterior segment of the eye (conjunctival papilloma, squamous neoplasia, conjunctival mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, Mooren&apos;s ulcer, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis) and the posterior segment of the eye (serpiginous choroidopathy, posterior uveitis, pseudophakic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The therapy with IFN- remains a promising alternative in cases of a failing response to conventional therapy, helping to maintain or improve visual acuity, prevent vision loss, and ameliorate the prognosis of the patient. However, clinicians who decide to use IFN- in their patients must be aware of general and ophthalmological side effects and inform their patients to undergo a systemic evaluation such as a physical examination, blood and serological tests, and a chest X-ray before the beginning of treatment. This review presents the current knowledge of the use of IFN-, its efficacy, and properties in ophthalmological diseases, and thus may encourage clinicians to administer this drug as a treatment modality in ophthalmological diseases in the future. &quot;</field>
