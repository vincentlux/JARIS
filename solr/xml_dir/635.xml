<field name="content">Factors Predictive of Double Anterior Chamber Formation Following Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.,&quot;The aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmological characteristics and genotypes of patients with congenital retinal pathologies, who display a bull&apos;s-eye maculopathy in the fundus, along with a negative scotopic electroretinogram. We analysed the results of five patients showing both a bull&apos;s-eye maculopathy, as well as a negative scotopic ERG evoked by a bright flash. Their median age was 39years (range 11-63years): three males and two females. All underwent a comprehensive examination with determination of distant visual acuity (ETDRS) and recording of the full-field ERG (scotopic and photopic). Fundus, OCT, and FAF images were obtained, the kinetic visual field was determined, and colour vision (D-15) was tested in most patients. Targeted gene panel sequencing was performed on peripheral blood. One patient carried a homozygous ABCA4 mutation and an additional heterozygous variant in CRX. Two of the five patients were shown to have a heterozygous mutation in the CRX gene, one of whom had an additional heterozygous ABCA4 mutation. Two patients had the common heterozygous mutation c.2413G&gt;A;p.Arg838His in GUCY2D. In all of the patients, there was a reduction in the amplitude of the b-wave with a regular a-wave amplitude in the scotopic bright-flash ERG. The five patients with bull&apos;s-eye maculopathy along with a negative ERG had differing genotypes. Mutations were found in the CRX gene (2 patients), the ABCA4 gene (1 patient), and the GUCY2D gene (2 patients). &quot;</field>
