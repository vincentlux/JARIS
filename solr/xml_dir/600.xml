<field name="content">Choroidal Vascular Changes in Arteritic and Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.,&quot;A 17-year-old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of retro-orbital pain of the left eye and an altitudinal visual field defect for 2 weeks. Fundus examination revealed ipsilateral hyperaemic optic disc oedema, and the patient was admitted with the presumptive diagnosis of left optic neuritis. Subsequently, during follow-up, the patient developed a retinal granulomatous lesion in the superior temporal arcade with vitritis and fibrotic strands extending to the mid-periphery. Serum antibodies detection by ELISA and aqueous humour immunoblot were positive for &lt;i&gt;Toxocara canis&lt;/i&gt; Medical therapy with albendazole and oral steroids was instituted with satisfactory results. One year later, a new macular lesion developed with consequent vision loss. &quot;</field>
