<field name="content">Absence of Therapeutic Benefit of the Anti-Inflammatory Protein TSG-6 for Corneal Alkali Injury in a Rat Model.,&quot;To determine if changes in OCT parameters including peripapillary RNFL thickness and GCC thickness in Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder exist, and to correlate them with disease severity and clinical characteristics. A case-control study conducted on 40 patients with bipolar disorder were compared to 40 matched healthy controls. Both patients and controls were subjected to ophthalmic examination including: BCVA, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, and OCT imaging. Patients were also subjected to Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Thinning of average (RNFL) and average (GCC) thickness of right and left eye in patients with BPD (whether received electroconvulsive therapy or not) when compared with control subjects. Number of episodes, age at onset and severity of disease showed insignificant correlation with OCT parameters. Significant degenerative changes were detected by OCT in patients with bipolar disorder that were not affected by receiving ECT and not related to disease severity or duration. &quot;</field>
