<field name="content">Artificial Intelligence and Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging.,&quot;To correlate cone- and rod-mediated function with morphology of the macula in preterm-born children without and with spontaneously regressed retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We performed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) single scans in the macular center of preterm-born children aged 6 to 12 years (mean  SD, 7.4  1.8) without ROP (noROP; n = 59) and with spontaneously regressed ROP (srROP; n = 34), documented with wide-angle digital imaging during routine screening for acute ROP, and compared the data from 14 age-matched term-born children. SD-OCT data were compared to functional cone- and rod-mediated results of scotopic and photopic chromatic pupillometry (cP) and two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (2C-FCP). SD-OCT showed a shallowed foveal pit with significantly reduced outer nuclear layer to inner retinal layer ratio, indicating macular developmental arrest (MDA). MDA was present in 44% of the srROP and 27% of the noROP children. Pupil reaction to photopic red stimuli on blue background showed significantly lower values in all preterm-born children with MDA. In accordance, photopic light increment sensitivity (LIS) to red stimuli in the foveal center on the 2C-FCP was also significantly reduced in children with MDA. Under scotopic conditions, no significant differences were apparent in both pupil reaction with cP and LIS with 2C-FCP. Both objective pupillary response to cone-mediated photopic red stimuli and subjective central cone-mediated results in fundus-controlled perimetry were reduced in preterm-born children with MDA. MDA was present in a significant number of patients with srROP, but also without ROP. &quot;</field>
