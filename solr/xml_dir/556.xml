<field name="content">Classification of Regions of Nonperfusion on Ultra-widefield Fluorescein Angiography in patients with Diabetic Macular Edema.,&quot;We report a case of restrictive strabismus caused by early scleral buckle (SB) migration within 1month of surgery after successful medical management of SB infection. A 24 year-old man underwent scleral buckling surgery for left eye inferior retinal detachment (RD). A solid silicone buckle element was placed inferiorly along with an encircling silicone band. Two days after surgery, he presented with SB infection. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the exudate at conjunctival suture sites. Since the retina was well attached and it was only the second postoperative day, it was decided to retain the buckle. SB infection was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and topical fortified cefazolin and successfully eradicated. One month thereafter, anterior SB migration was noted on slit lamp biomicroscopy. Restrictive strabismus and diplopia were also noted. Eventually, SB removal was performed at 2months. This case report highlights the role of infection and subsequent inflammation as a cause for buckle migration and restrictive strabismus in the early post-operative period. These changes can be seen as early as 1month after primary surgery and may occur even after successful medical management of the SB infection. &quot;</field>
