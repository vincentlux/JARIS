<field name="content">Design and fabrication of drug-eluting polymeric thin films for applications in ophthalmology.,&quot;To examine the outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract surgery in eyes with herpes zoster-related keratitis and/or uveitis and evaluate the risks for recurrent disease. Public ophthalmology service, Auckland, New Zealand. Retrospective case series. Patients with herpes zoster-related keratitis and/or uveitis who had cataract surgery in the ipsilateral eye were reviewed. Outcome measures were intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative visual acuity, and recurrent disease. Fifty-seven eyes of 57 patients were included. Thirty-eight patients (66.7%) had recurrent disease before cataract surgery. Intraoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (14.0%) and included posterior capsule tear in 2 patients (3.5%). Postoperative complications included intraocular pressure of 30mm Hg or higher in 2 patients (3.5%) and central corneal edema in 8 patients (14.0%); all resolved by 1month. Cystoid macular edema occurred in 2 patients (3.5%). The median corrected distance visual acuity at 12months was 20/40 (interquartile range, 20/30-20/50). Corneal scarring was associated with poorer vision (P=.003). Herpes zoster recurred in 23 patients (40.4%) after surgery. An increased risk for recurrence was associated with shorter periods of quiescence (P=.029) and greater number of recurrences before surgery (P=.039). One eye was eviscerated because of the severity of the disease. Phacoemulsification in eyes with previous herpes zoster-related keratitis or uveitis posed a mildly increased risk for intraoperative and postoperative complications; however, herpes zoster disease recurrence after surgery was common and was severe in some cases. Consideration should be given to maximizing the period of quiescence before surgery and the potential role of antiviral prophylaxis. &quot;</field>
