<field name="content">REVERSE SUTURE TECHNIQUE FOR INTRAOCULAR LENS REFIXATION.,&quot;To study glycemic control, mortality and long-term complications in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Cross-sectional study. Referral centre at a government teaching hospital. Patients with T1D with age 18 years at onset. We retrospectively collected demographic data from computer records from 1991 to 2015. Prospective study for outcomes was conducted between 2012 and 2016. Mortality rate, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and microvascular complication rate. The proportion of T1D patients (n=512) &lt;5 years of age at onset was 18.6% between 1995 and 2004, and 24.2% in 2005-2014 (P&lt;0.001). Twenty eight patients had died out of 334 whose living status was known (mortality 1.1 per 100 patient-years over 2549 patient-years follow up). Median (range) HbA1c (n=257) was 8.3% (5.1-15.0%). At least one episode of severe hypoglycemia (coma/seizure/inability to assist self) had occurred in 22.8% patients over two years. Hypertension was present in 11.7% patients. Microvascular complications screen in 164 eligible patients [median (range) age 20 (8-45) y and duration of diabetes 9.1 (5-30) y] showed diabetic nephropathy in 3.0%, proliferative retinopathy in 3.6% and LDL cholesterol &gt;100 mg/dL in 34% patients. The mortality rate and prevalence of hypertension were high, given the short duration of diabetes of the patients. The proportion of patients with age 5 years at onset of diabetes has increased at our center. &quot;</field>
