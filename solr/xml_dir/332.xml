<field name="content">Measurement of Contrast Sensitivity in Patients with Behet&apos;s Disease without Ocular Involvement.,&quot;To assess the impact of presenting visual impairment (PVI) on the utilization of formal home care services in Canada. Formal home care services were defined as services provided by professionals. Presenting visual impairment was self-reported impaired vision. Cross-sectional survey. Respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging 2008/2009 (n = 30 865). Self-reported utilization of formal home care services were compared by PVI status and sociodemographic groups. Overall, 23.9% of Canadians aged 45+ years with PVI utilized home care services versus 4.8% of those without (p &lt; 0.0001). Canadians aged 65+ years (11.5%) used home care services more frequently than those aged 45-64 years (2.3%; p &lt; 0.001). Among Canadians aged 65+ years, Caucasians (11.8%) were more frequent users than non-Caucasians (2.9%; p = 0.0002). Among Caucasians aged 65+ years, higher levels of utilization were documented in seniors with PVI (32.3%) versus those without (11.0%; p &lt; 0.0001), females (14.5%) versus males (8.5%; p &lt; 0.0001), seniors without a partner (18.6%) versus those with a partner (7.9%; p &lt; 0.001), and seniors with incomes under the 20th percentile (14.7%) versus their peers with incomes 20th percentile (9.8%; p &lt; 0.0001). Seniors with PVI were 30% more likely than those without to utilize home care services after adjusting for confounding effects (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Among nonusers of home care services, unmet needs for home care services were reported by 10.0% of Caucasian seniors with PVI versus 3.1% of those without PVI (p &lt; 0.0001). Canadians with visual impairment are more likely to utilize formal home care services compared to those without. &quot;</field>
