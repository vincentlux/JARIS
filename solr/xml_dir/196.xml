<field name="content">Neuro-Behet&apos;s syndrome with a severe ocular lesion.,To assess the efficacy and safety of systemic interferon alpha-2a (IFN) for refractory pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (PCME). Retrospective observational study. The primary outcome was the decrease of central retinal thickness (CRT). Secondary endpoints were the improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the assessment of IFN-related side effects. Twenty-four eyes of 20 patients were included. The median CRT was 513 m (range 220-980 m) at baseline and decreased to 190 m (range 140-520 m) at the last follow-up visit (p &lt; 0.001). Reduction of CRT greater than 100 m was observed in 22 eyes (92%). The median BCVA (logMAR) increased statistically significant from 0.5 (range 0.2-1.5) at baseline to 0.3 (0-0.8) at the last follow-up (p &lt; 0.001). The BCVA improved in 18 eyes (75%) and remained stable in five eyes (21%). No severe treatment-related side effects occurred. IFN is a very effective agent for treatment of refractory PCME.</field>
