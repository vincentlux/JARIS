<field name="content">Long-Term Outcome of Punctate Inner Choroidopathy or Multifocal Choroiditis with Active Choroidal Neovascularization Managed with Intravitreal Bevacizumab.,&quot;To describe multimodal imaging findings, including fundus autofluorescence, in a patient with a growing choroidal osteoma. Case report. A 13-year-old girl presented with an asymptomatic lesion in the superonasal macula of her left eye. Vision was correctable to 20/20 in both eyes, and the only significant finding on examination was the yellow flat lesion in the left macula. It measured 0.8-disk areas in size. Ocular coherence tomography showed a space occupying lesion in the choroid that had horizontal hyper-reflective lines consistent with cancellous bone. Re-examination in a year showed enlargement. Fundus autofluorescence showed no abnormalities in either eye. Ultrasonography showed a hyper-reflective lesion with associated shadowing that was consistent with a choroidal osteoma. Normal fundus autofluorescence was seen in this young girl with a growing choroidal osteoma. Fundus autofluorescence is a proxy for the health of the retinal pigment epithelium. Normal retinal pigment epithelium is the only factor found to be predictive of future growth of a choroidal osteoma. This noninvasive test may prove useful as a guide to determine frequency of examinations especially in younger patients who might be prone to more rapid growth.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.
