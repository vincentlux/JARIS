<field name="content">Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation of Hepatic Tumors: Single-Center Experience With Intermediate to Long-Term Outcomes.,"Interventional radiology has revolutionized the local management of bone tumours, offering new minimal invasive alternatives to surgery and radiotherapy. Its role has continuously increased over the past years for the treatment of benign tumors and also of some malignant ones, especially in palliative situations. The development of protective techniques and new ablative technologies, such as cryoablation, contributes to expand the role of the interventional radiologist to new fields of applications in musculoskeletal oncology.
