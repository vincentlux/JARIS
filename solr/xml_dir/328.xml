<field name="content">Recurrent &lt;i&gt;Enterococcus faecalis&lt;/i&gt; Endophthalmitis.,&quot;Little is known about how low vision services by ophthalmologists are being provided. Here, we analyze the patterns of provision and utilization of vision rehabilitation services in Ontario, Canada. Retrospective population-based study between 2009 and 2015. Ophthalmologists (n = 92) who billed for vision rehabilitation services through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan in Ontario and the patients (n = 8949) who received these services. Billing data for low vision services (2009-2015) was received from Ontario Health Insurance Plan. Data were analyzed to describe patient demographics (age, sex, geographic distribution, number, and type of visits) and service provider information (geographic location, number of years providing services, and number of services per year). It is estimated that  5% of patients with low vision in Ontario accessed these vision rehabilitation services by ophthalmologists. The majority of these patients were females (61%) and &gt; 60 years old (79%). While patient and provider geographic distributions overlapped in the areas with largest patient populations, many regions lacked services. The majority of patients (71%) made only one vision rehabilitation visit. Nine providers practiced low vision for 7 years, while 43 provided services for only 1 year. In 2015, the most common diagnostic service provided to low vision patients was Optical Coherence Tomography of the retina and the most common therapeutic service was intravitreal for wet age-related macular degeneration. Although low vision services increased between 2009 and 2015, there were differences in ability to access care based on age, sex, and geographic location. &quot;</field>
