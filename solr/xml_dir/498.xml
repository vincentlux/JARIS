<field name="content">Spectrum of the neurologic manifestations in childhood-onset cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.,&quot;Although chebulic acid isolated from &lt;i&gt;Terminalia chebular&lt;/i&gt; has diverse biological effects, its effects on the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the expression of downstream genes have not been elucidated. The purpose of this research is to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanism of chebulic acid against oxidative stress produced by &lt;i&gt;tert&lt;/i&gt;-butyl hydroperoxide (&lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BHP) in liver cells. The treatment with chebulic acid attenuated cell death in &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BHP-induced HepG2 liver cells and increased intracellular glutathione content, upregulated the activity of heme oxygenase-1, and also increased the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and Nrf2 target gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The exposure of chebulic acid activated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The overall result is that chebulic acid has cytoprotective effect on &lt;i&gt;t&lt;/i&gt;-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes. &quot;</field>
