<field name="content">[Be cautious to treat retinopathy of prematurity with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy].,&quot;To compare parameters of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph [HRT] II) in high myopia with age- and sex-matched emmetropes. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese subjects aged 18 to 35 years at BP Koirala Lions Centre for Ophthalmic Studies, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu from November 2015 to October 2016. Fifty consecutive subjects with high myopia (spherical equivalent ranging from -6.00 to -12.00 diopters) and age- and sex-matched emmetropic subjects were enrolled for comparison. Correlations between disc area and other HRT parameters, asymmetry between the right and left eyes, and comparisons between male and female subjects in both high myopic and emmetropic groups were evaluated. Disc area was not significantly (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.11) larger in high myopic eyes than in emmetropic eyes. HRT parameters in highly myopic eyes involved smaller cup parameters and greater rim parameters compared with emmetropic eyes. Disc area was found to be significantly positively correlated with inter disc parameters and significantly negatively correlated with rim to disc area ratio in the high myopia group. Disc area and other intra-disc parameters showed significant correlations between right and left eyes in both high myopia and emmetropia, and no significant differences between males and females from a Nepalese population. Characteristics of HRT parameters in high myopic eyes involved smaller cup parameters and greater rim parameters compared with emmetropic eyes in a Nepalese population. The effect of disc area on HRT parameters differed significantly only in height variation contour by emmetropic eyes. &quot;</field>
