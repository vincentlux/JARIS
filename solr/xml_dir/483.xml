<field name="content">Aerobic exercise and Orexin A: role of sympathetic activity and redox system.,&quot;Visual disorders like double vision, dry eyes, and visual field deficits are common but frequently missed in Parkinson&apos;s disease. Here, we aim to increase awareness for these visual disorders in Parkinson patients by discussing several common problems that can be easily diagnosed using comprehensive history taking and a basic neuro-ophthalmological examination. We offer practical guidance for the patient interview and physical exam that can facilitate a timelier recognition of visual disorders. Such recognition has immediate therapeutic relevance, because Parkinson patients are strongly dependent on an adequate vision, for example to optimally benefit from visual cueing strategies. &quot;</field>
