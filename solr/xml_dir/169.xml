A review.,&quot;Rett syndrome (RS) is a severe neurological developmental disorder characterised by stereotypical hand movements, epileptic seizures, craniofacial dysmorphism and digestive dysfunction. This study aimed to examine the correlation between the severity of malocclusion and &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; in patients with RS. This preliminary study was conducted at the Ear, Nose &amp; Throat Clinic of the University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy, from January 2014 to December 2017. A total of 56 patients with RS were examined and grouped according to the severity of &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; (absent, mild, moderate or severe) and malocclusion (&lt;2 mm, 2-3 mm, 3-4 mm or &gt;4 mm). All of the patients were female and the mean age was 11.3 years. Eight (14.3%) patients had mild, 18 (32.1%) had moderate and 30 (53.6%) had severe &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt;. Four (7.1%) patients had &lt;2 mm occlusion, 10 (17.9%) had 2-3 mm occlusion, 26 (46.4%) had 3-4 mm occlusion and 16 (28.6%) had &gt;4 mm occlusion. Mild &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; was observed in 100% and 40% of patients with &lt;2 and 2-3 mm malocclusion, respectively, while moderate &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; was present in 60% and 38.5% of patients with 2-3 and 3-4 mm malocclusion, respectively. Severe &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; was observed in 28.6% and 87.5% of patients with 3-4 and &gt;4 mm malocclusion, respectively. There was a significant correlation between &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; and malocclusion severity (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &lt;0.001). A higher degree of malocclusion was associated with more severe &lt;i&gt;dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; among a cohort of patients with RS. &quot;</field>
