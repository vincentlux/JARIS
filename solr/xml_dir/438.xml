<field name="content">Separate Gene Transfers into Pre- and Postsynaptic Neocortical Neurons Connected by mGluR5-Containing Synapses.,&quot;Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Ribosomal inactivating proteins derived from plants specifically target ribosomes and irreversibly inhibit protein synthesis. EpCAM antibody and saporin were conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The mass of the conjugates were characterised using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI). The saporin-EpCAM (SAP-EpAB) conjugates were tested &lt;i&gt;in-vitro&lt;/i&gt; against MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), WERI-Rb1 (retinoblastoma) cells. The flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were performed to show the binding efficiency of SAP-EpAB conjugate. Whole transcriptome changes of sap-conjugate treated cells were studied using affymetrix microarrays. MALDI-TOF analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the conjugation of SAP with EpCAM antibody. Flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy analysis revealed the binding of SAP-EpAB conjugates to the MCF-7, WERI-Rb1 cells. Apoptosis assay by annexin-V has shown an increased apoptotic and necrotic population in conjugate treated cells. MTT assay confirmed the tumour cell death and had shown the IC&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; value of 0.8g for conjugate in MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), and 1g for WERI-Rb1 (retinoblastoma) cells. The microarray analysis revealed downregulation of the tumourigenic genes and upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes leading to apoptosis of tumour cells. &quot;</field>
