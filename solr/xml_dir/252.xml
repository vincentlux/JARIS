<field name="content">An overview of optical coherence tomography angiography and the posterior pole.,&quot;In a study published last year we showed the Barrett was the single most accurate IOL formula overall. Herein we report on the outcomes of new or updated formulas when run against the same datasets. Achievement of a target refractive outcome has become an integral part of cataract surgery. Fortunately, the advent of optical biometry and introduction of newer generation intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas has improved our ability to accurately predict cataract surgery refractive outcomes, as we showed in a study published in Ophthalmology last year.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Since that report, several new or updated formulas have become available. We evaluated the latest formulas using the same dataset to determine whether they offer the potential for even more accurate prediction of refractive outcomes. The study was performed under a Kaiser Permanente IRB approval which did not require individual informed consent. &quot;</field>
