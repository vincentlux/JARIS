<field name="content">Low-Intensity Exercise in Mice Is Sufficient to Protect Retinal Function During Light-Induced Retinal Degeneration.,&quot;MicroRNA-182 (miR-182) is abundantly expressed in mammalian retinas; however, the association between miR-182 and retinal function remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether miR-182 contributes to functional decline in retinas using a miR-182 depleted mouse. Electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes at different ages were measured in miR-182 knockout (KO) mice. The thickness and lamination of retinas were assessed using a color fundus camera and high-resolution optical coherence tomography. Expression levels of key photoreceptor-specific genes and the miR-183/96/182 cluster (miR-183C) were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. RNA sequencing and light-induced damage were carried out to observe the changes in the retinal transcriptome and sensitivity to light damage in the miR-182 KO mice. The ERG recording reveals that the ERG response amplitude decreased both at early and later ages when compared with control littermates. The expression of some key photoreceptor-specific genes was down-regulated with deletion of miR-182 in retina. RNA sequencing indicated that some biological processes of visual system were affected, and the numbers of potential target genes of miR-182 were presented in the mouse retina using bioinformatics analysis. The miR-182 KO mice were characterized by progressively losing the outer segment after being treated with light-damage exposure. The thickness and lamination of retina as well as compensatory expression of miR-183C showed no apparent changes in retina of miR-182 KO mice under normal laboratory lighting condition. Our findings provided new insights into the relationship between the miR-182 and retinal development and revealed that miR-182 may play a critical role in maintaining retinal function. &quot;</field>
