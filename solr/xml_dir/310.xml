<field name="content">Widespread gene transfer to malignant gliomas with In vitro-to-In vivo correlation.,Cataract is an opacification of the lens. Pediatric cataracts can be congenital or acquired. Acquired cataract including the one caused by corticosteroid used. It occurred as bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts and tended to be progressive. Treatment of choice is lens extraction with or without intraocular lens (IOL). We present a case of posterior subcapsular cataract that occurs in a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis that was using corticosteroid therapy. The routine ophthalmologic examination should be performed in children who received treatment with corticosteroids in the long term so that with early detection it can be given early treatment.</field>
