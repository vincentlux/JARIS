<field name="content">[Imaging Diagnosis and Interventional Radiology for Thoracic Surgery].,&quot;Percutaneous image-guided cryo- (CA) and radiofrequency- (RFA) ablations have been widely used in the treatment of painful bone metastases (BM). However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N=37; 75,5%) or RFA (N=12; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N=11, 22.5%), breast (N=21; 42.9%), lung (N=8; 16.3%) and other (N=9; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N=10). Mean follow-up was 34.122months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N=14); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (&gt;2cm) predicted local tumor progression (p=.002). Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies used in the radical treatment of BM in oligometastatic patients demonstrate significant rates of LPFS providing the size of BM 2cm.&quot;</field>
