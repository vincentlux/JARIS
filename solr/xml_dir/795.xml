<field name="content">Management of Type 2 Bubble Formed During Big-Bubble Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.,&quot;We present a rare case of infected pyogenic conjunctival granuloma mimicking a conjunctival abscess as complication of strabismus surgery in a Saudi girl with exotropia. Despite administration of local antibiotics following strabismus surgery, a patient presented with localised redness and discharge after three weeks. The patient was afebrile with no signs of pre-septal or orbital cellulitis. After culture (&lt;i&gt;Staphylococcus aureus&lt;/i&gt;) sensitivity testing the patient was prescribed oral Amoxicillin and Clavulanate and reviewed under general anaesthesia. A 55mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; conjunctival pyogenic granuloma was noted. A punch biopsy specimen indicated inflammatory and histiocytic cells. The addition of steroid to the medical therapy resulted in a quiet eye after three weeks. &quot;</field>
