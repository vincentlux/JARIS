<field name="content">Longitudinal Clinical Follow-up and Genetic Spectrum of Patients With Rod-Cone Dystrophy Associated With Mutations in PDE6A and PDE6B.,&quot;To investigate eight previously unreported Pakistani families with genetically undefined OCA for mutations in TYR. Sanger sequencing of TYR has been performed in eight families with OCA phenotype. Mutation analysis was performed to establish the pathogenic role of novel mutation. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict the structural and functional impacts on protein due to the mutation. In this study, we identified six likely pathogenic variants of TYR (c.272 G&gt;A, c.308 G&gt;A, c.346C&gt;T, c.715 C&gt;T, c.832 C&gt;T and c.1255 G&gt;A), including one novel variant (c.308 G&gt;A; p.Cys103Tyr), segregating as appropriate in each family. Cys103 lies in the highly conserved region of the tyrosinase enzyme, and p.Cys103Tyr is predicted to disturb enzymatic function via alteration of the configurational orientation of TYR leading to a more rigid polypeptide structure. We have also reviewed the mutation spectrum of TYR in Pakistani ethnicity. Published data on OCA families proposed that ~40% have been associated with genetic variations in the TYR gene. The mutations reported in this study have now been described with varying frequencies in Pakistani families, including very rare/unique mutations. A literature review of TYR gene mutations in Pakistani populations, combined with our genetic data, identified a number of gene mutations likely to represent regional ancestral founder mutations of relevance to Pakistani populations, in addition to sporadic and recurrent &apos;hotspot&apos; mutations present repeatedly in other regions worldwide. &quot;</field>
