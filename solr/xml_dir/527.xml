<field name="content">Effect of 21-gene recurrence score in decision-making for surgery in early stage breast cancer.,&quot;An 84-year-old woman with a history of dry age-related macular degeneration presented with an acute inability to read but intact writing ability (pure alexia or alexia without agraphia). She denied any difficulty speaking, paresthesias, or hemiparesis. Her visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Macular examination, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein angiography demonstrated the previously diagnosed macular drusen and geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium consistent with the dry form of age-related macular degeneration OU. Automated perimetry revealed a right homonymous hemianopsia. Neuroimaging confirmed a left occipital ischemic infarction with involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum producing the classic disconnection syndrome of alexia without agraphia. &quot;</field>
