<field name="content">Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy Treated with Acupuncture: A Case Report.,&quot;To study the development, characterisation, and drug release of one- and two-layered thin films based on organic polymers [poly(D,L-lactide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolide) lactide:glycolide (65:35), poly(D,L-lactide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-glycolide) lactide:glycolide (75:25), and polycaprolactone] and dexamethasone. To examine their applicability for intraocular lenses (IOLs) and function in intraocular drug delivery systems. Four series of thin films, single and double-layer, were prepared by the spin-coating method on a silicon substrate. The films were studied using atomic force microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The release rate of dexamethasone was studied for a period of ten weeks. Series A and C demonstrated the formation of large dexamethasone aggregates. The monolayer films of series C and D formed pores, in agreement with previous findings. The spectroscopic ellipsometry study demonstrated that the samples were transparent. The drug release study demonstrated that dexamethasone was released during the first 6 weeks at a desirable rate. The films exhibited properties suitable for use in intraocular drug delivery systems. The single-layer thin films demonstrated a sufficient encapsulation of dexamethasone and appropriate release of the therapeutic substance. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility of developing the films directly on the surface of the IOL. &quot;</field>
