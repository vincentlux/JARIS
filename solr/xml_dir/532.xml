<field name="content">The potential and value of objective eye tracking in the ophthalmology clinic.,&quot;In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) allows non-invasive imaging of the living human cornea, specifically enabling the detection of immune cells in the healthy and diseased ocular anterior segment. Studies using IVCM have provided insight into the effects of contact lens wear on corneal Langerhans cell density and morphology, and the effects of eye drops on conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue. IVCM has also been shown to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in distinguishing infective and non-infective uveitis and in diagnosing atypical infective keratitis. In the research setting, this technology has enhanced our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in corneal neuropathy and angiogenesis. In vivo - ex vivo correlation using animal models has helped overcome some of the difficulties in identifying cell type on IVCM images. As highlighted in this review, currently there are multiple established, and emerging, clinical and research applications for IVCM in the inflamed anterior segment. &quot;</field>
