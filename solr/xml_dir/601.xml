<field name="content">Retrospective Validation of the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity (G-ROP) Criteria in a Japanese Cohort.,&quot;To assess the effects of decentration and tilt at different orientations on the optical quality of a rotationally asymmetric multifocal intraocular lens (IOL). Shandong Eye Institute, Qingdao, China. Experimental study. A rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOL (SBL-3) was tested using standardized optical bench testing. The optical quality was quantified using the modulation transfer function (MTF), through-focus MTF, and images of the United States Air Force Target test at apertures of 3.0mm and 4.5mm. The multifocal IOL was measured while it was centered, decentered by 0.3mm and 0.5mm, and then tilted by 3 degrees and 5 degrees at near-horizontal (near vision zone), distance-horizontal (distance vision zone), and vertical orientations of the long axis of the multifocal IOL. The optical performance was better at the aperture of 4.5mm than at 3.0mm for the centered multifocal IOL. The optical quality was improved at near focus and decreased at distance focus for the near-horizontal decentration, contrary to the status for the distance-horizontal decentration, with a more obvious tendency at the 3.0mm aperture than at 4.5mm. For the near-horizontal tilting, the optical quality at near focus was more significantly deteriorated than distance focus, opposite to that for the distance-horizontal tilting, with a more distinct tendency at a 4.5mm aperture than at 3.0mm. The optical quality of the asymmetric multifocal IOL was sensitive to and varied significantly after decentration and tilt at specific directions. The decentration induced increased or decreased optical quality, whereas tilt just yielded decreased optical quality. &quot;</field>
