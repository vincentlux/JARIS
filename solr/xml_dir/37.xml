<field name="content">Thermal ablation versus surgical resection for localized hepatocellular carcinoma: a population study using the SEER database.,&quot;In the last decade, the spectrum of interventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-guided procedures, including percutaneous ablation, has substantially grown, and among the available MRI-compatible ablative techniques, cryoablation is progressively gaining a predominant position.The aim of the present narrative review is to discuss the technical requirements necessary to perform a percutaneous MRI-guided cryoablation in a closed-bore machine; to highlight the relative advantages and drawbacks; and to briefly summarize the results available in the literature. &quot;</field>
