<field name="content">Comparison of the efficacy of different cell sources for transplantation in total limbal stem cell deficiency.,&quot;To evaluate the anatomic versus functional changes in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by studying the correlation of retinal vascular perfusion density and dark adaptation (DA). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and DA tests were performed in diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls. DA was measured using AdaptDx dark adaptometer and the rod intercept was recorded. Macular OCTA images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue. Eighty-six eyes from 57 patients with diabetes (19 with no DR, 19 with non-proliferative DR [NPDR], and 19 with proliferative DR [PDR] who had undergone photocoagulation) and 10 eyes from 10 patients without diabetes were recruited. A significant decrease in vascular density and a prolonged rod intercept were found as DR progressed (P&lt;.01). A negative trend was found between vascular density and the rod intercept. The negative trend in the deep layer (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.28) was more substantial than that in the superficial layer (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.14). A prolonged rod intercept was associated with elevated HbA1c (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;=0.08). The vascular density of the macula could be assessed by OCTA and the functional change in the outer retina could be measured non-invasively by DA. The severity of decreasing vascular density and prolongation of DA are proportional to progression of DR. Decreased deep retinal vascular perfusion density and impaired DA response are correlated and show a negative trend according to the severity of DR. &quot;</field>
