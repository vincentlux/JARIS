<field name="content">Pulmonary Cryoablation Zones: More Aggressive Ablation Is Warranted In Vivo.,"This report describes the technical aspects of trans-arterial embolization (TAE) of renal cell carcinoma prior to percutaneous ablation. All patients (n = 11) had a single renal mass (mean tumor diameter = 50.2 mm; range: 28-84 mm). Selective TAE was performed via the common femoral artery. Embolic materials included: particles alone (n = 4), coils alone (n = 1), particles + ethiodized oil (n = 2), particles + coils (n = 1), ethiodized oil + ethanol (n = 2), and particles + ethanol (n = 1). All embolizations were technically successful and no complications have been reported. After embolization, 10 patients underwent cryoablation while 1 patient underwent microwave ablation. Ablations were technically successful in 10 of the 11 patients. Only 3 minor complications were identified but none required treatment. No adverse effect on the patient's glomerular filtration rate was seen from the additional procedure (p = 0.84). TAE of renal cell carcinoma prior to percutaneous ablation is safe and technically-feasible."
