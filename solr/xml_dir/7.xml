<field name="content">[Panorama of limbal alterations].,&quot;The corneal limbus is a privileged region on the border between two quite different microenvironments, where corneal epithelial stem cells, numerous melanocytes, and antigen-presenting cells are all concentrated within a richly vascularized and innervated stroma. This situation within the ocular surface confers on it the key functions of barrier, epithelial renewal and defense of the cornea. As an immunological crossroads and since the corneoscleral limbus is directly exposed to external insults such as caustic agents, ultraviolet radiation, microbial agents, and allergens, it is the potential site of many tumoral, degenerative or inflammatory pathologies and may progress under certain conditions to limbal stem cell deficiency. &quot;</field>
