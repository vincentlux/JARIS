<field name="content">LncRNA NKILA inhibits retinoblastoma by downregulating lncRNA XIST.,&quot;We analyzed two siblings in a Japanese family with delayed onset cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) using whole-exome sequencing. A novel frameshift c.1106dup (p.H370Afs*17) variant and a known missense c.2027T&gt;A (p.I676N) variant in &lt;i&gt;CDHR1&lt;/i&gt; were identified. Both patients shared the same variants, although they displayed a significant difference in disease severity. A meta-analysis of the relationship between the severity and the variant type was performed using the reported cases in the literature and did not reveal a definitive correlation. &quot;</field>
