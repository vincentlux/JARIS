<field name="content">Prevalence and Phenotypes of Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Eyes With High Myopia.,&quot;Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) is a rare ocular lymphoid malignancy, which consists a subset of primary central system lymphoma (PCNSL) and the most common type of intraocular lymphoma. The involvement of eyes is estimated to be approximately 20% of PCNSL, but the brain involvement may be up to 80% of PVRL. Typically, PVRL is a high grade B-cell malignancy of the retina and needs to be assorted from choroidal low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Very often PVRL masquerades and can be erroneously diagnosed as chronic uveitis, white dot syndromes or other neoplasms. Establishing an accurate diagnosis may involve cytology/pathology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, molecular pathology and cytokine profile analysis. There is inadequate information about PVRL&apos;s true incidence, ethnic/geographical variation and pathogenetic mechanisms. The therapeutic approach of PVRL involves aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although PVRL tends to have a good response to the initial treatment, the prognosis is poor and the survival restricted due to the high relapse rates and CNS involvement. &quot;</field>
