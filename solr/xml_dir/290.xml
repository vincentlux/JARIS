<field name="content">Google searches and detection of conjunctivitis epidemics worldwide.,&quot;To evaluate the efficacy of switching to aflibercept in diabetic macular edema (DME) with suboptimal response to previous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. A prospective interventional case series study recruited patients from a single center diagnosed with DME with suboptimal response to anti-VEGF injections. Three consecutive monthly injections of aflibercept were performed. The primary outcome measure was mean change in visual acuity after switching to aflibercept. Forty-two patients (42 eyes) were included. Baseline logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity was 0.87  0.23 and improved significantly to 0.62  0.29, 0.56  0.34, and 0.46  0.35 at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively, after the first injection. Mean baseline retinal thickness was 451.57  107.09 m and decreased significantly at 1, 2, and 3 months after switching to aflibercept (346.52  79.03, 328.24  81.98, and 313.71  85.79 m, respectively). Both visual improvement and mean change in retinal thickness were significant in patients with pre-aflibercept best-corrected visual acuity less than 1.0 logMAR but were not significant in patients with best-corrected visual acuity more than 1.0 logMAR. Switching to aflibercept in DME patients with an unsatisfactory response to previous anti-VEGF injections provided acceptable short-term visual and retinal architectural improvement. &quot;</field>
