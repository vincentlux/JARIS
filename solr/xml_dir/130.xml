<field name="content">A glycopolymer improves vascoelasticity and mucociliary transport of abnormal cystic fibrosis mucus.,&quot;To evaluate the long-term outcome of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) or multifocal choroiditis (MFC) after intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. Retrospective study of consecutive patients of PIC/MFC complicated with active CNV. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), total number of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and recurrence of CNV. Correlation analysis was performed to find the correlation of various clinical factors and final BCVA. There were 23 eyes in 22 patients with a mean age of 33.22years included in this study. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.48years. Improvement of BCVA was noted through the first 3 years and at the final follow-up. BCVA at 1, 6, 12months and recurrence of CNV were correlated with final BCVA. Most patients of PIC/MFC complicated with CNV managed with intravitreal bevacizumab had improved BCVA over 4 years. &quot;</field>
