<field name="content">Extraciliary roles of the ciliopathy protein JBTS17 in mitosis and neurogenesis.,&quot;To determine whether geodemographic factors, specifically age, gender or commuting distance, affect the attendance rates of patients referred to a Diabetic Retinopathy Treatment (DRT) Centre from the Irish National Diabetic Retinal Screening (DRS) Programme. A retrospective analysis of the first 1200 patients who were referred for ophthalmic assessment between November 2013 and June 2015 to Cork University Hospital&apos;s (CUH) DRT clinic from the DRS was completed. A total of 972 (81%) patients attended all their scheduled DRT appointments. The attendance rates for those living in counties Cork and Kerry were 83.9% and 72.5%, respectively. Fifty-seven (4.75%) patients failed to attend any of their clinic appointments (2.2% of Cork and 11.8% of Kerry referrals). Patients living within 60km of the treatment centre were more likely to attend (p=0.013). Both age and gender were also shown to have a statistically significant impact on attendance, with those under 40years of age (p&lt;0.001) and male patients (p=0.02) less likely to attend their scheduled appointments. This study suggests a correlation between geodemographic factors (age, gender and commuting distance) and attendance at a DRT Centre. The longer commuting distance for Kerry patients contributes to their higher non-attendance rates indicating a need to provide a Kerry-based satellite treatment centre to improve accessibility. &quot;</field>
