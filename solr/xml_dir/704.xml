<field name="content">Protective effect of glycine in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract through aldose reductase inhibitory activity.,&quot;Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is an unexpected complication after penetrating keratoplasty during childhood. We report the case of delayed suprachoroidal hemorrhage after penetrating keratoplasty in a neonate as the first manifestation of hemophilia. A 4-day-old neonate was referred to our hospital because of bilateral corneal opacities present since birth. A diagnosis of bilateral Peter&apos;s anomaly type 2 with right eye corneal perforation was made after examination. Appropriate treatment was commenced, and later, right eye therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty combined with lensectomy, and anterior vitrectomy was performed. This was complicated postoperatively with suprachoroidal hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Conservative management was advised due to poor visual prognosis. Threemonths later, the patient was found to have high intraocular pressure in the left eye and glaucoma surgery was recommended. Proper hematological investigations before glaucoma surgery in the left eye revealed a low level of factor VIII with normal levels of factor IX and von Willebrand&apos;s factor antigen. Therefore, a diagnosis of hemophilia type A was established. This case serves as a reminder that the occurrence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage, especially in the absence of other predisposing risk factors, should warrant detailed systemic assessment to exclude underlying bleeding disorders. &quot;</field>
