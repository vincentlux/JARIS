<field name="content">Update on the Clinical Approach to Spatial Neglect.,&quot;Current outcome measures do not adequately address the esthetic aspect of the surgical outcome of anterior blepharotomy for Graves&apos; ophthalmopathy. This study aims to highlight the role of tarsal platform show (TPS) in optimizing the esthetic outcome of graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy for dysthyroid upper eyelid retraction in an ethnic Chinese population. The records of patients with Graves&apos; ophthalmopathy who underwent anterior blepharotomy for upper eyelid retraction over a period of 30months were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-five patients (77 eyelids) with upper eyelid retraction underwent anterior blepharotomy. A statistically significant decrease in marginal reflex distance (MRD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and lagophthalmos and significant increase in TPS following anterior blepharotomy was observed. A significantly higher proportion of patients who underwent unilateral anterior blepharotomy had TPS asymmetry post-operatively as compared to the bilateral group (p&lt;0.001). Using logistic regression, the study found that for every 1-mm change in MRD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there was approximately a 1.045-mm change in TPS. The mean percentage increase in TPS observed in our study was 303.1191% due to the low pre-operative TPS seen in Asian patients. To achieve the most ideal surgical outcome in graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy, the surgeon will need to consider not only eyelid height but also the subsequent TPS change. The surgeon needs to be mindful of the relationship between MRD&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; change and TPS change to optimize esthetic outcome as well as symmetry. Special considerations need to be taken in unilateral cases as well as patients with low pre-operative TPS. &quot;</field>
