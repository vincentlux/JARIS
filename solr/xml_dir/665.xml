<field name="content">&quot;Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, a Nuclear factor-B Inhibitor, on Endotoxin-Induced Uveitis in Rats In vivo and In vitro.&quot;,&quot;NanceHoran syndrome (NHS) is a rare Xlinked disorder with various clinical manifestations. The present study aimed to identify the pathogenic mutation causing NHS in a threegeneration Chinese family with 4 individuals presenting primarily with congenital cataracts. The genomic DNA of 5 individuals was collected, and family history and clinical information were recorded. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband, and candidate mutations were filtered by a series of screening processes and validated by Sanger sequencing. The identified pathogenic mutation was confirmed by cosegregation analysis. Finally, a novel frameshift mutation (NM_001291867.1: c.302dupA; p.Ala102fs) was identified in the NHS actin remodeling regulator (NHS) gene, which cosegregated with congenital cataracts in this family. Carrier females exhibited similar but milder clinical symptoms compared with the affected male. These clinical symptoms were consistent with the phenotypic features of the NHSassociated disease, NHS. In summary, the present study identified a novel NHS mutation in a Chinese family with atypical NHS; the results broaden the known pathogenic mutation spectrum of NHS and will aid in the genetic counseling of patients with NHS. The data from the present study also suggest that genetic analysis may be required for the diagnosis of this disease. &quot;</field>
