<field name="content">Adjunctive Thermoprotection During Percutaneous Thermal Ablation Procedures: Review of Current Techniques.,"Recent introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography(MDCT) with more than 64 scanners enabled high-speed scanning in wide range of the body. Electrocardiogram (ECG) gated scanning and 4-dimensional imaging provides precise evaluation of cardiac and vascular diseases. Fine vascular structures such as the artery of Adamkiewicz can be visualized due to improved spatial and temporal resolution of CT and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Interventional radiology also plays important roles in combination with surgical treatment. Complicated vascular embolization before and after surgery can be performed more safely using current microcatheters with increased flexibility and trackability and various kinds of detachable coils. Chylothorax also come to be treated by interventional radiology. Transnodal lymphography can visualize lymphatic leak followed by thoracic duct embolization. Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation for thoracic tumors, which is usually performed by real-time CT fluoroscopy, is expected to be officially approved. Newly developed techniques will further improve thoracic imaging diagnosis. Dual energy CT technology and new reconstruction technique can decrease the radiation dose without deteriorating image quality. Iodine imaging by dual energy CT can visualize vascular perfusion. Four-dimensional flow image of MRI can image vascular flow-dynamics without using contrast material."
