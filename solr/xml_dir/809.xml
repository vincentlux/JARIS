<field name="content">Two different initial treatment regimens of ranibizumab in myopic choroidal neovascularization: 12-Month results from a randomized controlled study-Response.,&quot;The main purpose of the study was to examine and identify factors that influence the future practice pattern of Saudi Board of Ophthalmology residents as well as their academic goals. This study also aimed to compare the plans and career goals of the current Saudi ophthalmology residents with a former cohort of Saudi ophthalmology residents. All current residents of Saudi Board of Ophthalmology were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in March 2017. Residents were contacted by email. The survey contained questions on demographics, plans and factors influencing career choice of the residents in their future. Data were categorized by gender. Chi-square was used to assess the effect of gender on outcomes where appropriate. Of 150 residents surveyed, 91 (61%) responded to the survey. Having the ability to combine medicine and surgery was the most motivating factor for pursuing an ophthalmology residency training program (81% of respondents). Most residents expressed an interest in providing refractive surgery (62%), being involved in research activities (85%) and working part-time in the private sector (73%). The majority (81%) expressed a desire to practice in an urban setting as well as pursuing fellowship training (81%). Anterior segment (31%) and surgical retina (15%) were the most popular choices for fellowship training. Increasing interest in joining fellowship training programs (mostly in surgical subspecialties) and being involved in research activities among current generation of ophthalmology residents have been observed compared to a previous cohort study in the same country. &quot;</field>
