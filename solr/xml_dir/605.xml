<field name="content">Hexahistidine-metal assemblies: A promising drug delivery system.,&quot;Two hundred twenty-two nanometers ultraviolet (UV) light produced by a krypton-chlorine excimer lamp is harmful to bacterial cells but not skin. However, the effects of 222-nm UV light exposure to the eye are not fully known. We evaluated acute corneal damage induced by 222- and 254-nm UV light in albino rats. Under deep anesthesia, 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley albino rats were exposed to UV light. The exposure levels of corneal radiation were 30, 150, and 600mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Epithelial defects were detected by staining with uorescein. Superficial punctate keratitis developed in corneas exposed to more than 50mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of UV light, and erosion was observed in corneas exposed to 600mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of UV light. Hematoxylin and eosin staining also showed corneal epithelial defects in eyes exposed to 254-nm UV light. However, no damage developed in corneas exposed to 222-nm UV light. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-positive cells were observed only in normal corneas and those exposed to 254-nm UV light. Although some epithelial cells were stained weakly in normal corneas, squamous epithelial cells were stained moderately, and the epithelial layer that was detached from the cornea exposed to 600mJ/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of light was stained intensely in corneas exposed to 254-nm UV light. In the current study, no corneal damage was induced by 222-nm UV light, which suggested that 222-nm UV light may not harm rat eyes within the energy range and may be useful for sterilizing or preventing infection in the future. &quot;</field>
