<field name="content">Reply.,&quot;Pathologic myopia (PM) is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide and especially in East Asian countries. The complications of PM include myopic maculopathy, myopic macular retinoschisis, dome-shaped macula, and myopic optic neuropathy. Posterior staphyloma is an important component of the diagnosis of PM and one of the hallmarks of PM. The photographic classification and grading system for myopic maculopathy has already been determined. Conventionally optical coherence tomography (OCT) was commonly used in PM and enabled investigators to image deeper tissue such as choroid and sclera. Today, the technological advances in OCT imaging including ultra-widefield OCT and 3-dimensional construction of OCT have given clinicians a novel insight on variable morphology in the PM. &quot;</field>
