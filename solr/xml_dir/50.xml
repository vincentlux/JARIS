<field name="content">Cryoablation of Primary Breast Cancer in Patients with Metastatic Disease: Considerations Arising from a Single-Centre Data Analysis.,&quot;A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials was undertaken to compare percutaneous thermal ablation versus partial nephrectomy (PN) for stage T1 renal tumors. A comprehensive search of major databases was conducted from October 2000 to July 2016. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were followed. Incidences of all-cause mortality (ACM), cancer-specific mortality (CSM), local recurrence (LR), and metastases, as well as complication rates and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were evaluated. Inclusion criteria were met by 15 of 961 papers. These studies represented 3,974 patients who had undergone an ablative procedure (cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation; n= 1,455; 37%) or PN (n= 2,519; 63%). ACM and CSM rates were higher for ablation than for PN (hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-2.87 [P &lt; .05]; HR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.66-8.88 [P&lt;.05], respectively). No statistically significant difference in LR rate or risk of metastasis was seen between ablation and PN (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.79-2.22 [P= .22]; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.67-5.01 [P= 0.23], respectively). Complication rates were lower for ablation than for PN (13% vs 17.6%; odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.94; P &lt; .05). A significantly greater decrease in eGFR was observed after PN (13.09 mL/min/1.73 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) vs ablation therapy (4.47 mL/min/1.73 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Thermal ablation showed no significant difference in LR or metastases compared with PN. Thermal ablation was associated with a lower morbidity rate and a lesser reduction in eGFR compared with PN, but with higher ACM and CSM rates.&quot;</field>
