<field name="content">Effect of cytoglobin overexpression on extracellular matrix component synthesis in human tenon fibroblasts.,&quot;Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is a rare autoimmune condition that typically presents as progressive uveitis and vitreoretinal degeneration between the second and third decades of life. Though traditionally attributed to inherited mutations of the CAPN5 gene, few reports of de novo variants exist. This report of vision and hearing loss in a 3 year-old girl describes the youngest documented case of ADNIV due to a de novo pathogenic c.865C&gt;T (p.Arg289Trp) CAPN5 variant, illustrating the early stages of this enigmatic disease process. &quot;</field>
