<field name="content">Papilledema from gain-of-function mutations in the STAT3 gene.,&quot;To report patients who demonstrated an alteration in the clinical and optical coherence tomography features of neovascular age-related macular degeneration after resolution of endophthalmitis. Retrospective case series of the subsequent changes in the macula and need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who developed endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection. The study included seven eyes of seven patients with follow-up ranging between 3 months and 11 years. The vitreous cultures (n = 7) before intravitreal antibiotic injection were the following: culture-negative (4) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3). Initial treatment included vitreous tap and injection (4) and pars plana vitrectomy (3). In 5/7 eyes, the optical coherence tomography showed resolution of subretinal fluid and serous pigment epithelial detachment, and there was no additional anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment administered. After successful treatment of endophthalmitis in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, there was relative involution of the maculopathy and reduced anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment burden in this series. &quot;</field>
