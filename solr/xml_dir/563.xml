<field name="content">Efficiently Recording the Eye-Hand Coordination to Incoordination Spectrum.,&quot;To characterize reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and the need for IOP-lowering medications following phacoemulsification combined with Kahook Dual Blade (KDB)-assisted goniosynechialysis and excisional goniotomy in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma and cataract. In this retrospective, interventional case series, preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were collected through 6 months of follow-up from 42 eyes of 24 subjects. Outcomes included mean IOP reduction, reduction in IOP-lowering medications, and the proportion of patients achieving IOP reduction20%, IOP 18mmHg, and reduction of1 medication. Preoperatively, mean (standard error) IOP was 25.5 (0.7) mmHg and the mean number of IOP-lowering medications used was 2.3 (0.1) per eye. Through 6 months of follow-up, mean IOP reductions of 10.1-12.8mmHg (38.4-49.5%; P&lt;0.0001) and mean IOP medication reductions of -2.2 to -2.3 (91.7-98.4%; P&lt;0.0001) were seen. At Month 6, 92.9% of eyes (39/42) achieved IOP18mmHg, 100% (42/42) achieved IOP reduction of 20%, 100% (42/42) required1 fewer medications for IOP control, and 85.7% (36/42) were medication-free. Phacoemulsification combined with KDB-assisted goniosynechialysis and excisional goniotomy safely provides statistically and clinically meaningful reductions in both IOP and the need for IOP-lowering medications in eyes with angle closure glaucoma. &quot;</field>
