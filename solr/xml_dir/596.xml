<field name="content">Modified endoscopic diving technique without the traditional irrigation system in endoscopic cranial base surgery: Technical Note.,&quot;Aripiprazole is an interesting psychoactive compound acting as a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5-HT(1A) partial agonist and serotonin 5-HT(2A) antagonist. Aripiprazole possesses a well-documented efficacy in the treatment of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms. However, this medication may be rarely associated with the onset of hiccup. Here, we present the case of aripiprazole-induced hiccup in a young inpatient at his first psychiatric admission together with a review of the current literature about this topic. The possible etiology underlying the emergence of hiccups together with the clinical implications of this adverse event are discussed. &quot;</field>
