<field name="content">Changes in corneal expression of MUC5AC after autologous serum eyedrop treatment in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency.,&quot;To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel topical cyclosporin A 0.05% nanoemulsion in comparison with a conventional emulsion in primary Sjgren&apos;s syndrome dry eyes. Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted. Corneal and conjunctival staining score was improved in both groups, with a faster change noted in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05). Tear film break-up time was significantly improved in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p &lt; 0.05), while ocular surface disease index score was improved in both groups without a difference at 12 weeks. Schirmer I value and goblet cell grade did not change in both groups. IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased in both groups at 12 weeks. Both nanoemulsion and conventional cyclosporin A improved ocular signs, symptoms, and conjunctival inflammation. However, the novel cyclosporin A nanoemulsion showed faster improvement of ocular surface staining scores than the conventional emulsion. &quot;</field>
