<field name="content">The Relation of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio with High Axial Myopia.,&quot;To investigate the age-related course of best-corrected visual acuity in healthy eyes. Two hundred participants (400 eyes) 25 to 74years of age (114 females, 86 males) were investigated, 20 per 5-year age group. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured monocularly with the ETDRS 2000 charts at a distance of 4m (Precision Vision, Woodstock, IL, USA). Strict exclusion and termination criteria were used. Visual acuity did not change between ages 25 and 54years (mean of the better eyes, -0.180.05 logMAR). A significant age-related break-point in visual acuity was found at the ages of 55-59years. For all age groups, the overall mean visual acuity was -0.150.06 logMAR for the better eyes and -0.130.06 logMAR for the worse eyes. There was no difference between the right and left eyes (-0.140.06 logMAR). The visual acuity was better in the right eye in 29% (n=58) of the participants, better in the left eye in 32% (n=64), and the same in both eyes in 39% (n=78). From ages 25 to 64years, neither the better nor the worse eye had a visual acuity worse than 0.0 logMAR. Best-corrected visual acuity was constantly high until the age of 54years. An age-related break-point appeared at 55 to 59years of age. Until age 64, a minimal angle of resolution smaller than 1min of arc (visual acuity better 0.0 logMAR) can be expected in healthy eyes. &quot;</field>
