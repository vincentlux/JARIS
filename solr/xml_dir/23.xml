<field name="content">Describing Retinopathy of Prematurity: Current Limitations and New Challenges.,&quot;To study the effect of glistenings on the optical quality of a hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL). David J. Apple Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. An invitro laboratory study. An accelerated aging protocol was used to induce glistenings (microvacuoles) in 38 hydrophobic acrylic IOLs. The IOLs were warmed to 45C and then cooled to 37C. Image analysis of light-microcopy photographs determined the number and size of microvacuoles (MV). A classification was applied based on the glistening number per mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: grade 0 (none), grade 1 (1-100), grade 2 (101-200), grade 3 (201-500) and grade 4 (more than 500). An optical bench was used to measure each IOL&apos;s modulation transfer function (MTF) and Strehl ratio to evaluate the impact of glistenings on image quality. Glistenings were observed in all IOLs. The mean glistening numbersSD (MV/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in grades 1 through 4 were 7412.7, 14222.2, 29776.2, and 1509311.9, respectively. The mean glistening sizes in grades 1 through 4 were 13.283.85m, 15.882.08m, 16.853.23m, and 15.272.25m, respectively. Statistical analysis showed thatgrades 1 through 3 did not change the optical quality; however,in grade 4, the MTF and the Strehl ratio were significantly affected. A limited number of glistenings (&lt;500MV/mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) had no effect on the image quality. Although statistically significant deteriorations in the MTF and the Strehl ratio were observed in grade 4, the effects found were small and are unlikely to affect the visual quality. &quot;</field>
