<field name="content">&quot;Homozygous stop-gain variant in LRRC32, encoding a TGF receptor, associated with cleft palate, proliferative retinopathy, and developmental delay.&quot;,&quot;To assess the differences in cytokine levels in the aqueous humor (AH) of bilateral eyes receiving sequential phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. The levels of 33 cytokines in AH samples collected from separate single-eye operations of 26 age-related cataract patients who experiencing sequential cataract surgery were compared between the first-eye and second-eye groups. The AH level of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-2), an immunosuppression regulator, in the second-eye group was significantly higher than that in the first-eye group (p=0.002). No differences in the concentrations or detection rates of other cytokines were observed between the first- and second-eye groups. During bilateral sequential cataract surgery, the AH of the second eye had a higher level of TGF-2 but not of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines compared with those in the first eye, implying a protective mechanism preventing the sympathetic immune reaction induced by the first-eye cataract surgery. &quot;</field>
