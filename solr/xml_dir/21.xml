<field name="content">Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma in Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.,&quot;It is currently unclear if longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects bone mineral density (BMD). BMD measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and history of fragility fracture was determined in 75 T1D participants with 50years of diabetes duration and 75 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls. BMD T-scores were determined for the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN). T1D participants had median diabetes duration of 54 [52, 58] years, 41 (55%) were females, and mean A&lt;sub&gt;1c&lt;/sub&gt; was 7.30.8%. T1D females had higher LS T-scores compared to female controls (-0.31.2 vs. -1.11.4, p=0.014), lower FN T-scores (-1.51.0 vs. -1.20.9, p=0.042) and more fragility fractures (7 (17%) vs. 1 (2%), p=0.021). In T1D, higher A1c was associated with higher adjusted odds of fragility fracture (p=0.006). T1D males and controls showed no difference in BMD or fractures. There were no substantial differences in T-score between T1D and matched controls; however, T1D females showed higher BMD at the LS and possibly paradoxically higher fragility fractures compared to matched controls. These findings suggest that lower T-scores may not be associated with a history of fragility fracture in females with longstanding T1D and that other factors should be investigated. &quot;</field>
