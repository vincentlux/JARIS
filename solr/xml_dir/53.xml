<field name="content">Characterization of deeply embedded corneal foreign bodies with anterior segment optical coherence tomography.,&quot;To evaluate the efficacy of an intravitreal dexamethasone (IVD) implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) without macular edema (ME). A retrospective cohort study was designed, and 20 eyes of 20 patients diagnosed with non-ischemic CRVO without ME were included. A total of 10 CRVO eyes were observed without treatment, and another 10 CRVO eyes received a single IVD injection at baseline. Mean changes in pathomorphologic parameters of fundus and optical coherence tomography parameters were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12months. The decreases in venous tortuosity (p=0.014 for superior; 0.036 for inferior arcades) and width (p=0.024 for superior; 0.003 for inferior arcades) from baseline to 12months after injection were significantly greater in the treated group than the observed group. The improvements in RNFL swelling (p=0.010) and retinal hemorrhage (p=0.006) were also significantly greater in the treated group. Visual symptom improvement was significantly faster in the treated group (p=0.001). In two cases, IVD injection resulted in complete resolution of cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with the CRVO, leading to complete visual recovery in 1 week. None of the treated eyes showed signs of ME development, ischemia progression, or neovascularization. IVD implant was significantly effective in improving venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, RNFL swelling, and visual symptoms by presumed alleviation of disc swelling and venous outflow. This treatment may be a considerable treatment option in CRVO patients with no ME. &quot;</field>
