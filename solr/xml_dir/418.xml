<field name="content">Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of Retinal Arterial Macroaneurysm With Overlying Hemorrhage.,&quot;We investigated the characteristics of the choriocapillaris flow voids using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in 85 patients (164 eyes) with hypertension (meanSD age, 5611 years; 45% women; 20% poorly controlled BP; 16% diabetes) who are without ocular diseases and determined possible correlations with systemic vascular risk factors. Data on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, and urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (MCR) were collected. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation. OCTA imaging (66mm scans; AngioVue) with quantitative microvascular analysis of the choriocapillaris was performed. Linear regression was used to investigate the association of systemic risk factors with area (percentage), size (pixels) and number of choriocapillaris flow voids. Diabetes (=0.33; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.63) and daytime systolic BP (=-0.13; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.02) were associated with areas of flow voids. Age (=0.21; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.36) and daytime diastolic BP (=-0.18; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02) were associated with size of flow voids. Age (=-21.21; 95% CI, -31.79 to -10.63) and nighttime diastolic BP (=13.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 27.17) were associated with number of flow voids. Kidney parameters were not associated with any features of flow voids. In patients with hypertension, a higher BP appeared to increase blood flow in the choriocapillaris which needs to be considered when using the OCTA to study eye diseases in hypertensives. &quot;</field>
