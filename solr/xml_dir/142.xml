<field name="content">Outer Retinal Oxidative Stress Measured In Vivo Using QUEnch-assiSTed (QUEST) OCT.,&quot;Gout is a common arthritis caused by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Here we investigated loci influencing SUA in a genome-wide meta-analysis with 121,745 Japanese subjects. We identified 8948 variants at 36 genomic loci (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;&lt;510&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;) including eight novel loci. Of these, missense variants of &lt;i&gt;SESN2&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;PNPLA3&lt;/i&gt; were predicted to be damaging to the function of these proteins; another five loci-&lt;i&gt;TMEM18&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;TM4SF4&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;MXD3-LMAN2&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;PSORS1C1-PSORS1C2&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;HNF4A&lt;/i&gt;-are related to cell metabolism, proliferation, or oxidative stress; and the remaining locus, &lt;i&gt;LINC01578&lt;/i&gt;, is unknown. We also identified 132 correlated genes whose expression levels are associated with SUA-increasing alleles. These genes are enriched for the UniProt transport term, suggesting the importance of transport-related genes in SUA regulation. Furthermore, trans-ethnic meta-analysis across our own meta-analysis and the Global Urate Genetics Consortium has revealed 15 more novel loci associated with SUA. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of hyperuricemia/gout. &quot;</field>
