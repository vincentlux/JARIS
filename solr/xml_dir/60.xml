<field name="content">Elevated Plasma Levels of Drebrin in Glaucoma Patients With Neurodegeneration.,&quot;To identify the image modality allowing identification of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) complicating chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), including fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Patients diagnosed with chronic CSCR and secondary CNV were included in the study. The image modalities FA, ICGA, and OCT-A were reviewed for specific CNV signs permitting diagnosis. Patients with missing image modalities, poor image quality, previous laser treatment, or other confounding pathologies were excluded. CNV was identified on OCT-A in 32 of 33 eyes (97%), whereas ICGA revealed an abnormal vascular network in 23 eyes (70%), significantly less frequently than with OCT-A (p=0.003). FA allowed CNV identification in 10 eyes (30%), significantly less frequently than with OCT-A (p&lt;0.001). Type 1 CNV was detected by OCT-A in 29 of 30 eyes (97%), by ICGA in 20 eyes (67%; p=0.0027), and by FA in 8 eyes (27%; p&lt;0.001). OCTA is a useful diagnostic tool to detect occult CNV complicating chronic CSCR. This image modality might be important for adequate patient care. &quot;</field>
