<field name="content">Individualized penetrating keratoplasty using edge-trimmed glycerol-preserved donor corneas for perforated corneal ulcers.,&quot;There is an increasing interest in identifying non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in idiopathic Parkinson&apos;s disease (PD). Dopamine-transporter SPECT (DAT-SPECT), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) provide unique information about the brain&apos;s neurotransmitter and microstructural properties. In this study, we evaluate the relative and combined capability of these imaging modalities to predict symptom severity and clinical progression in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; PD patients. To this end, we used MRI, SPECT, and clinical data of &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; drug-nave PD patients (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 205, mean age 61  10) and age-, sex-matched healthy controls (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; = 105, mean age 58  12) acquired at baseline. Moreover, we employed clinical data acquired at 1 year follow-up for PD patients with or without L-Dopa treatment in order to predict the progression symptoms severity. Voxel-based group comparisons and covariance analyses were applied to characterize baseline disease-related alterations for DAT-SPECT, DTI, and sMRI. Cortical and subcortical alterations in &lt;i&gt;de novo&lt;/i&gt; PD patients were found in all evaluated imaging modalities, in line with previously reported midbrain-striato-cortical network alterations. The combination of these imaging alterations was reliably linked to clinical severity and disease progression at 1 year follow-up in this patient population, providing evidence for the potential use of these modalities as imaging biomarkers for disease severity and prognosis that can be integrated into clinical trials. &quot;</field>
