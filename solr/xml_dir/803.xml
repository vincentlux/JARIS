<field name="content">A Small Bite on the Eyelid,&quot;To report the initial misdiagnosis of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. The medical records of 76 consecutive patients diagnosed with VKH disease were reviewed retrospectively at The Eye Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients were referred to The Eye Center from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. The initial diagnosis was made by an ophthalmologist or neurologist. The main outcome measure was to evaluate cases with VKH disease who were initially misdiagnosed. In 7 (9.2%) out of the 76 patients the initial diagnosis was incorrect. Patients were initially misdiagnosed as optic neuritis (1.3%), intracranial hypertension (1.3%), brain tumor (1.3%), Susac disease (1.3%), migraine (1.3%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1.3%) or anterior granulomatous uveitis of unknown etiology (1.3%). Patients underwent unnecessary tests including MRI and invasive procedures including CSF analysis and anterior chamber paracentesis. The initial diagnosis of patients with VKH disease was incorrect in 9 % of the cases. Delay in the diagnosis of VKH disease may lead to delay in management and may cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors with poor visual outcome. &quot;</field>
