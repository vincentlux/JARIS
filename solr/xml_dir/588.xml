<field name="content">Long-term Clinical Results of Vitrectomy and Scleral Buckling in Treatment of Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.,&quot;Effective migration of dendritic cells into the lymphatic system organs is the prerequisite for a functional dendritic cell vaccine. We have previously developed a porous silicon microparticle (PSM)-based therapeutic dendritic cell vaccine (Nano-DC vaccine) where PSM serves both as the vehicle for antigen peptides and an adjuvant. Here, we analyzed parameters that determined dendritic cell uptake of PSM particles and Nano-DC vaccine accumulation in lymphatic tissues in a murine model of HER2-positive breast cancer. Our study revealed a positive correlation between sphericity of the PSM particles and their cellular uptake by circulating dendritic cells. In addition, the intravenously administered vaccines accumulated more in the spleens and inguinal lymph nodes, while the intradermally inoculated vaccines got enriched in the popliteal lymph nodes. Furthermore, mice with large tumors received more vaccines in the lymph nodes than those with small to medium size tumors. Information from this study will provide guidance on design and optimization of future therapeutic cancer vaccines. &quot;</field>
