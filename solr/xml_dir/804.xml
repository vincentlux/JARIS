<field name="content">Cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.,&quot;To report a critical case series of six patients with posterior microphthalmos (PM). Complete ophthalmologic examinations of all patients were performed using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), cycloplegic refraction, applanation tonometry, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, fundoscopy, A and B mode ultrasonography (USG), keratometry, and optic coherence tomography (OCT). The most significant clinical characteristics of male patients aged 10-25years was the presence of shorter posterior segments (mean: 15.27-18.91mm) accompanying high hyperopia (mean +9.00 - +18.50 diopter) despite the normal anterior segment findings. The BCVA ranged between 20/320 and 40/100. Retinal folds were detected bilaterally on the papillomacular band in all patients. Although neurosensory retina was included in the fold in OCT images, retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, and sclera were not included in the fold. Pigmentary retinopathy was detected in one patient. Despite normal anterior segment, posterior microphthalmos is characterized with high hyperopia, and shorter axial length and bilateral papillomacular retinal fold. Refractive amblyopia, uveal effusion syndrome, retinal detachment and macular hole are complications that can be corrected. Posterior microphthalmos must be kept in mind in patients with a normal anterior segment, and high hyperopia. &quot;</field>
