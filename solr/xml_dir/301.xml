<field name="content">Relation between Baseline Total Serum Cortisol Level and Outcome in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.,&quot;To report our 5-year experience with intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) in the intravitreal chemotherapy (IvitC) era. Retrospective review of retinoblastoma treated with primary unilateral IAC in the IvitC era (2012-2017). There were 34 eyes treated with IAC alone versus 20 eyes treated with IAC plus IvitC for vitreous seeds. IAC (IAC alone vs. IAC plus IvitC) consisted of melphalan (41 vs. 10%) or melphalan plus topotecan (59 vs. 90%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.03). IvitC consisted of melphalan (60%) or melphalan plus topotecan (40%). Tumor control and globe salvage were achieved in 100% of group B and C eyes without IvitC. Despite more extensive vitreous seeds in the IvitC group (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &lt; 0.01), comparison of IAC alone versus IAC plus IvitC revealed no difference in tumor control for group D (88 vs. 69%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.36) or group E (67 vs. 100%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.25) and no difference in globe salvage for group D (88 vs. 69%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.36) or group E (58 vs. 57%, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; = 0.39). IAC is effective as primary therapy for unilateral group B, C, D, and E retinoblastoma. IvitC is an important adjuvant therapy to achieve comparable globe salvage rates for group D and E eyes with persistent active vitreous seeds. &quot;</field>
