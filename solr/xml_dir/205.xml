<field name="content">Primary Acquired Toxoplasma Retinochoroiditis: Choroidal Neovascular Membrane as an Early Complication.,&quot;To evaluate the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and adverse reactions after the use of lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution for the treatment of patients with dry eye disease (DED). Retrospective chart review was performed in 121 patients seen at the Duke Eye Center with DED who were prescribed lifitegrast 5% and seen for follow-up after treatment initiation. Charts were reviewed for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading, conjunctival and corneal staining scores, and tear breakup time (TBUT), as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire scores and self-reported adverse reactions were also assessed. The average patient age was 60.5 years (range, 22-88 years); 87.6% were female, and 20.7% had a previous autoimmune disease diagnosis. Of the 54 eyes with an initial positive MMP-9, 21 eyes (38.9%) normalized after treatment. The ocular symptoms OSDI subscore demonstrated an improvement of -2.436.85 (P=0.011) after treatment. Corneal staining scores showed an average change of -0.15 (P=0.007). The average change in TBUT was 1.9 sec (P&lt;0.001). Self-reported adverse reactions were noted in 31.4% of patients. There was no statistically significant change in MGD grading. Patients with moderate-severe DED showed statistically significant improvements in conjunctival and corneal staining scores and TBUT (-0.170.66, P=0.0442; -0.540.65, P&lt;0.001; +2.022.63, P=0.004, respectively). Lifitegrast 5% is a useful therapeutic option for DED with a moderate proportion of self-reported adverse reactions, all of which were related to ocular discomfort. Treatment with lifitegrast was associated with statistically significant improvements in MMP-9 levels, ocular symptoms, corneal staining, and TBUT. &quot;</field>
