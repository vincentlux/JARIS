<field name="content">Behaviors Associated with Internet Use in Military Medical Students and Residents.,&quot;To compare the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) added the infusion fluid with a control group in the event of grade C PVR in recurrent retinal detachment (RD). The records of the patients with recurrent retinal detachment with grade C PVR who underwent vitrectomy for retinal detachment surgery between April 2003 and October 2004 were reviewed retrospectively for this comparative study. The recurrent retinal detachment patients with grade C PVR who underwent vitrectomy and had a minimum post-operative follow-up period of 12months were included. The patients were divided into two groups as study and control groups. 5-FU (200 microgram/ml) and low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) (5IU/ml) was added into the infusion solution of the study group. Primary outcome measure of this study was the single operation anatomical success at month 12. A total of 43 eyes of 43 patients were included. The control group was consisted of 26 eyes (60.5%) and the 5-FU group was consisted of 17 eyes (39.5%). At month 12, single operation anatomical success was obtained in 14 of the 26 patients (53.8%) in the control group and in 16 of the 17 patients (94.1%) in the 5-FU group (p=0.005). Favorable outcomes were obtained in the patients with recurrent RD and grade C PVR in whom 5-FU and LMWH added infusion fluid which was used during vitrectomy. &quot;</field>
