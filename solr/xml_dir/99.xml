<field name="content">Appearance of Polypoidal Lesions in Patients With Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomographic Angiography.,&quot;BACKGROUND lncRNA BANCR participates in the pathogenesis of various types of human diseases; however, its involvement in diabetic retinopathy is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the expression of lncRNA BANCR in plasma of patients with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic patients without complications, and healthy controls was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The accuracy plasma BANCR in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy was analyzed by ROC curve analysis. lncRNA BANCR expression vector and siRNA were transfected into the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay. RESULTS We found that lncRNA BANCR was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetic retinopathy compared to diabetic patients without complications and healthy controls. Upregulation of lncRNA BANCR effectively distinguished patients with diabetic retinopathy from diabetic patients without complications and healthy controls. High-glucose treatment led to upregulated expression of BANCR in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Overexpression of BANCR promoted and siRNA silencing inhibited the apoptosis of cells in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 in a high-glucose environment. CONCLUSIONS lncRNA BANCR is overexpressed in patients with diabetic retinopathy and can promote apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelial cells. &quot;</field>
