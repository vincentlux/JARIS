<field name="content">Evaluation of tear osmolarity and tear function in patients with Behet&apos;s syndrome.,&quot;G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the target for many drugs. Evidence continues to accumulate demonstrating that multiple receptors form homo- and heteromeric complexes, which in turn dynamically couple with G proteins, and other interacting proteins. Here, we describe a method to simultaneously determine the identity of up to four distinct constituents of GPCR complexes using a combination of sequential bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SRET&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The method is amenable to moderate throughput screening of changes in response to ligands and time-course analysis of protein-protein oligomerization. &quot;</field>
