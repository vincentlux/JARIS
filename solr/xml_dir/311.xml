<field name="content">Effect of somatostatin on human retinal pigment epithelial cells permeability.,&quot;Prevalence of many eye and ocular surface diseases increases with age. While the clinical characteristics and pathophysiologic mechanisms of these conditions are often either known or extensively studied, the effects of normal aging on tear film and ocular surface have not been as widely researched. In order to examine the effects of aging on tear fluid proteomics, tear fluid samples were collected preoperatively from 115 subjects undergoing strabismus or refractive surgery using glass microcapillary tubes. In addition to their refractive error or strabismus, the subjects did not have any other current, known eye diseases. The non-pooled samples were analysed using NanoLC-TripleTOF implementing a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry, resulting in quantified data of 849 proteins. According to correlation results, 17 tear proteins correlated significantly with increased age and many of these proteins were connected to inflammation, immune response and cell death. According to enrichment analysis, growth and survival of cells decreased while immune response and inflammation increased with aging. We also discovered several well-known, activated and inhibited upstream regulators, e.g. NF-B, which has been previously connected to aging in numerous previous studies. Overall, the results show the common age-dependent alterations in tear fluid protein profile, which demonstrate similar age-associated alterations of biological functions previously shown in other tissue and sample types. &quot;</field>
