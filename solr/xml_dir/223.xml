<field name="content">The protective variant rs7173049 at LOXL1 locus impacts on retinoic acid signaling pathway in pseudoexfoliation syndrome.,&quot;Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) usually presents as unilateral and has acute onset. In Arab population, the proportion of open- and closed-angle glaucoma is similar. To the best of our knowledge, chronic PACG in very young age is rare. We share a case report of a teenage girl with advanced glaucomatous changes and, on gonioscopy, had synechia and closed angle of anterior chamber. She was treated by bilateral laser iridotomy and topical glaucoma medication. The author concludes that, even at very young age, in the absence of predisposing factors for secondary glaucoma, the patient should be investigated for PACG and managed accordingly. &quot;</field>
