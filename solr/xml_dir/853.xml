<field name="content">Endometrial Vascularization Characterized by Optical Coherence Tomography and Immunohistochemistry in Women Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer Treatment.,&quot;Dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (AP) predisposes individuals to a number of diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and C3 glomerulopathy. Moreover, glomerular Ig deposits can lead to complement-driven nephropathies. Here we describe the discovery of a highly potent, reversible, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of factor B, a serine protease that drives the central amplification loop of the AP. Oral administration of the inhibitor prevents KRN-induced arthritis in mice and is effective upon prophylactic and therapeutic dosing in an experimental model of membranous nephropathy in rats. In addition, inhibition of factor B prevents complement activation in sera from C3 glomerulopathy patients and the hemolysis of human PNH erythrocytes. These data demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of using a factor B inhibitor for systemic treatment of complement-mediated diseases and provide a basis for its clinical development. &quot;</field>
