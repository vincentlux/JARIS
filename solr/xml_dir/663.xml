<field name="content">Comparative Study Between Topical Gatifloxacin 0.5% and Moxifloxacin 0.5% as a Prophylactic Measure Before Intraocular Surgery.,&quot;The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (GOL) and certolizumab pegol (CZP) as additional treatment options for the treatment of uveitis. Patients with longstanding uveitis receiving either GOL or CZP were retrospectively evaluated in terms of frequency of ocular flares, drug survival, changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and steroid-sparing effect. Twenty-one patients (30 eyes), 17 of whom being female, were enrolled in the study; 16 out of 21 patients had been previously treated with other tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- blockers. A significant reduction in ocular flares (from 128.6 bouts for 100 patients-year to 42.9 events for 100 patients-year) was observed between the 12 months prior to the start of GOL or CZP and the 12 months thereafter (p=0.01). The 36-month drug survival was 54.5% for CZP and 50.0% for GOL with no statistically significant differences between the two biologic agents. No differences were detected concerning BCVA values and the mean corticosteroid intake between baseline and the last follow-up. The safety profile was excellent. GOL and CZP represent effective and safe treatment choices for patients with uveitis also when unsuccessfully treated with other anti-TNF- drugs, permitting a significant reduction in the frequency of ocular flares and preserving visual function with a good long-term retention rate. &quot;</field>
