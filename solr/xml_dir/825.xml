<field name="content">&quot;A preliminary validation of the Arabic version of the &quot;&quot;Profile of Emotional Competence&quot;&quot; questionnaire among Tunisian adolescent athletes and nonathletes: insights and implications for sports psychology.&quot;,&quot;The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography (ERG) describes a minimum protocol for clinical testing but encourages more extensive testing where appropriate. This ISCEV extended protocol describes an extension of the ISCEV full-field ERG standard, in which methods to record and evaluate the growth of the dark-adapted (DA) ERG b-wave with increasing stimulus energy are described. The flashes span a range that includes the weakest flash required to generate a reliable DA ERG b-wave and that required to generate a maximal b-wave amplitude. The DA ERG b-wave stimulus-response series (also known historically as the &quot;&quot;intensity-response&quot;&quot; or &quot;&quot;luminance-response&quot;&quot; series) can more comprehensively characterize generalized rod system function than the ISCEV standard ERG protocol and may be of diagnostic or prognostic value in disorders that cause generalized rod system dysfunction. &quot;</field>
