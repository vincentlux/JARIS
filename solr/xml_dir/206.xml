<field name="content">Correlation Between &lt;i&gt;Dysphagia&lt;/i&gt; and Malocclusion in Rett Syndrome: A preliminary study.,&quot;To report a patient with chronic ocular graft versus host disease who achieved long-term stability of a descemetocele using prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) treatment. Case report and literature review. A 60-year-old white man, who underwent PROSE treatment 4 years earlier to address severe dry eyes secondary to ocular graft versus host disease, developed a central corneal ulcer that resulted in descemetocele formation. Because of the risks of surgical intervention in an immunocompromised patient with severe ocular surface disease, the descemetocele was monitored closely as the patient continued PROSE device wear. After 1 year with continued PROSE therapy, the patient&apos;s descemetocele remained stable without perforation and corrected visual acuity stabilized at 20/50 in the affected eye. This is the first case that reports stabilization of a descemetocele with a PROSE device. For patients at high risk for postsurgical complications, PROSE treatment could be considered as an alternative to corneal transplantation and as an adjunct to other ocular therapies in patients with descemetocele formation. &quot;</field>
