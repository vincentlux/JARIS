<field name="content">TIMP-1 Mediates Inflammatory and Immune Response to IL-6 in Adult Orbital Xanthogranulomatous Disease.,&quot;To describe the occurrence of epiretinal membrane (ERM) in eyes with vitreomacular traction and to correlate the presence of ERM with retinal structural alterations detected using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. In this retrospective observational cross-sectional study, we collected data from 502 eyes (307 patients) with diagnosis of vitreomacular traction. The presence of ERM and retinal lesions (cystoid cavities, neuroepithelial detachment, external limiting membrane, and ellipsoid zone discontinuity) was determined by standardized grading of macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans. The occurrence of ERM in eyes with vitreomacular traction was 37.5%. The mean  SD central foveal thickness was 411  60 m in eyes with ERM and 380  148 m in eyes without ERM (P &lt; 0.05). The occurrence of cystoid cavities (38.3% vs. 23.2%, P &lt; 0.05), neuroepithelial detachment (24.5% vs. 9.9%, P &lt; 0.0001), external limiting membrane discontinuity (16.5% vs. 5.1%, P &lt; 0.0001), and ellipsoid zone discontinuity (13.3% vs. 6.7%, P &lt; 0.05) was higher in eyes with ERM. The mean  SD best-corrected visual acuity was 0.45  0.16 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/50) in eyes with ERM and 0.37  0.09 in eyes without ERM (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/40, P &lt; 0.0001). Symptoms of metamorphopsia were present in 55 of 188 eyes with ERM (29.3%) and 40 of 314 eyes without ERM (12.7%, P &lt; 0.0001). This study reported the occurrence of ERM in eyes with vitreomacular traction and demonstrated that ERM is significantly associated with an increased occurrence of other structural changes of the neuroretina and a negative effect on quantity and quality of vision. &quot;</field>
