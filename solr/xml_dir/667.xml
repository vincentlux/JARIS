<field name="content">Morbidity in a longitudinal cohort of children residing in villages randomized to 6 monthly treatment with azithromycin versus placebo.,&quot;In recent years, gut microbiota (GM) has emerged as a key factor in shaping the pathogenesis of a vast array of immune-mediated diseases, as well as in the response to immune-based treatments such as anti PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy or influenza vaccination. In addition, GM has a significant role in the immune system development and is fundamental in developing mucosal immunity. Recent data suggest that GM plays an important role in the immune system of immune deficient patients. GM status has a remarkable impact on the immune system and in immune deficient patients; this can lead to important consequences. Prebiotics are indeed a promising candidate in restoring GM homeostasis and improving immunity. Antibiotics are also capable of altering the microbial equilibrium. &quot;</field>
