<field name="content">Survival of retinal ganglion cells after damage to the occipital lobe in humans is activity dependent.,&quot;Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor with affinity for the trace amines. TAAR1 agonists have pro-cognitive, antidepressant-, and antipsychotic-like properties in both rodents and non-human primates (NHPs). TAAR1 agonism also increases wakefulness and suppresses rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in mice and rats and reduces cataplexy in two mouse models of narcolepsy. We investigated the effects of TAAR1 agonism in Cynomolgus macaques, a diurnal species that exhibits consolidated night-time sleep, and evaluated the effects of TAAR1 agonists on cognition using a working memory (WM) paradigm in this species. Adult male Cynomolgus macaques (n=6) were surgically implanted to record the electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram, and locomotor activity (LMA) and the efficacy of the TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 (0.1,1,10mg/kg, p.o.) on sleep/wake, EEG spectra, and LMA was determined. In a second experiment, the acute effects of RO5263397 (0.1,1,10mg/kg, p.o.) were assessed on a delayed-match-to-sample test of WM in adult male macaques (n=7). RO5263397 (10mg/kg) administered at lights off, when sleep pressure was high, promoted wakefulness and reduced both REM and non-REM sleep without inducing hyperlocomotion. RO5263397 (10mg/kg) also increased delta/theta activity during all vigilance states. RO5263397 had no effect on WM at either short (2sec) or long (10sec) delay intervals. The wake-enhancing and REM-suppressing effects of R05263397 shown here in a diurnal primate are consistent with previous results in nocturnal rodents. These effects and the associated alterations in EEG spectra occurred without inducing hyperlocomotion or affecting WM, encouraging further study of TAAR1 agonists as potential narcolepsy therapeutics. &quot;</field>
