<field name="content">Unilateral Papilledema as the Presenting Sign of Spinal Metastases.,&quot;The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of persistent postoperative cystoid macular edema (pCME) in patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (ERM) only versus those with ERM peel combined with internal limiting membrane peel (ILM). Secondary endpoints of the study were to review both the central macular thickness (CMT) and visual acuity. The patients were divided in two groups, one group in which only the ERM was peeled (n=36 patients) and another group in which both the ERM and the ILM were removed (n=62 patients). The results were analyzed retrospectively. Each patient received a complete ophthalmological examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an ETDRS chart and spectral domain optical coherence tomography, at three time points: prior to surgery and 3 weeks and 3 months after surgery. A total 98 eyes of 98 patients were included in this study. The mean follow-up time was 7.7months. CMT decreased significantly after surgery in all patients, and none of these changes differed significantly between the two groups. The BCVA increased significantly after surgery across all patients, and there were no significant changes between the two treatment groups. Postoperative pCME occurred in eight patients in each group, representing 22.2% of the 36 patients in the ERM only group and 12.9% of the 62 patients in the ERM/ILM peel group. However, this difference was not statistically significant. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of incidence of pCME. Both groups experienced had similar decrease in the CMT and improvement in the BCVA postoperatively. &quot;</field>
