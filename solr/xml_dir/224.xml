<field name="content">SARILUMAB FOR RECALCITRANT CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA IN NON-PARANEOPLASTIC AUTOIMMUNE RETINOPATHY.,&quot;Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of combination ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine (ICEV) in advanced-stage pediatric retinoblastoma [International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) group D or E], and in ICRB group C in the second eye in simultaneously treated bilateral retinoblastoma. The medical records of retinoblastoma patients treated with concurrent ICEV regimen and focal therapy were retrospectively reviewed. The ICEV treatment protocol was, as follows: ifosfamide 1800mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Days 1-3; MESNA 600mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Days 1-3; carboplatin 560mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Day 1; etoposide 150mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Days 1-3; and vincristine 1.5mg/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on Day 1. Of 16 retinoblastoma patients, 13 had bilateral disease. Seven first eyes in bilateral disease that were enucleated prior to ICEV therapy were excluded. Twenty-two eyes were finally included (six group C, six group D, and ten group E). Median follow-up was 3.4years, and the median number of ICEV courses was 7. Fifteen globes could be salvaged, 12 responded to ICEV (six group C, five group D, and one group E), and three unresponsive eyes could be salvaged with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Enucleation-free and relapse-free survival was 68.2 and 54.5%, respectively. The results of this study suggest ICEV as an alternative therapeutic approach for globe salvage in pediatric retinoblastoma, especially in ICRB groups C and D with manageable acute toxicity. Further study in larger cohort is needed to confirm the effectiveness of treatment. &quot;</field>
