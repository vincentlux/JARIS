<field name="content">&quot;Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Following Intravitreal Bevacizumab Therapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity: a prospective, case-control study.&quot;,&quot;Long non-coding RNA H19 has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis. However, whether H19 regulates the progression of corneal neovascularization (CNV) is unclear. This study aimed to determine the function of H19 in CNV and its possible molecular mechanism. Here, we found that the H19 levels were remarkably increased in vascularized corneas and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). &lt;i&gt;In vitro&lt;/i&gt; , H19 upregulation promoted proliferation, migration, tube formation and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in HUVECs, and it was found to downregulate microRNA-29c (miR-29c) expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that H19 mediated the above effects by binding directly to miR-29c. In addition, miR-29c expression was markedly reduced in vascularized corneas and its expression also decreased in bFGF-treated HUVECs &lt;i&gt;in vitro&lt;/i&gt; MiR-29c targeted the 3&apos; untranslated region (3&apos;-UTR) of VEGFA and decreased its expression. These data suggest that H19 can enhance CNV progression by inhibiting miR-29c, which negatively regulates VEGFA. This novel regulatory axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CNV. &quot;</field>
