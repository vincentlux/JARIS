<field name="content">Blindness and acute pancreatitis: Purtscher-like retinopathy.,&quot;The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature on simulator-based training in vitreoretinal surgery (VRS). We examined the results regarding simulated VRS and provided an overview of how the current results may be employed in VRS training. Lastly, we evaluated the quality of these results. The databases of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for articles in English involving simulated VRS training. A qualitative analysis was performed, since the studies which met our inclusion criteria did not allow for a quantitative meta-analysis. We identified 203 articles of which seven met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six studies investigated simulation with EyeSi Surgical (VRMagic, Mannheim, Germany). Six studies reported positive performance curves. Four studies showed construct validity. One study attempted to show skill transfer from simulator to vitrectomies performed on cadavers. Methodological quality of the included studies was moderate but lacking in instrument validation. Simulator-based training in VRS can assess and possibly assist acquisition of a variety of VRS skills. Further research is needed to support transfer from simulator to operating room. Future studies should strive to follow established validation frameworks and streamline study designs. &quot;</field>
