<field name="content">Comparison of head-mounted perimeter (imo&lt;sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;) and Humphrey Field Analyzer.,&quot;Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of infections in humans. Photodynamic therapy using blue light (450nm) could possibly be used to reduce MRSA on different human tissue surfaces without killing the human cells. It could be less harmful than 300-400nm light or common disinfectants. We applied blue light  riboflavin (RF) to MRSA and keratinocytes, in an in vitro liquid layer model, and compared the effect to elimination using common disinfection fluids. MRSA dilutions (810&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;/mL) in wells were exposed to blue light (450nm)  RF at four separate doses (15, 30, 56, and 84J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Treated samples were cultivated on blood agar plates and the colony forming units (CFU) determined. Adherent human cells were cultivated (110&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;/mL) and treated in the same way. The cell activity was then measured by Cell Titer Blue assay after 24- and 48-h growth. The tested disinfectants were chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide. Blue light alone (84J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) eliminated 70% of MRSA. This dose and riboflavin eradicated 99-100% of MRSA. Keratinocytes were not affected by blue light alone at any dose. A dose of 30J/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in riboflavin solution inactivated keratinocytes completely. Disinfectants inactivated all cells. Blue light alone at 450nm can eliminate MRSA without inactivation of human keratinocytes. Hence, a high dose of blue light could perhaps be used to treat bacterial infections without loss of human skin cells. Photodynamic therapy using riboflavin and blue light should be explored further as it may perhaps be possible to exploit in treatment of skin diseases associated with keratinocyte hyperproliferation. &quot;</field>
