<field name="content">Higher TGF-2 Level in the Aqueous Humor of the Second Eye Versus the First Eye in the Course of Sequential Cataract Surgery.,&quot;To describe a novel reverse suture approach to safely and securely refixate dislocated intraocular lenses (IOLs). We describe two cases herein where we use a reverse suture technique to refixate dislocated IOLs. By reversing the needle-holder grasp on a Gore-Tex suture needle, we can safely insert the base of the needle through the pars plana. This allows for looping of the suture around the haptic of subluxated or dislocated IOL. We use the technique in a case with a subluxed plate haptic IOL and a subluxed three-piece IOL with an encircling capsular tension ring. The reverse suture technique allows for safe and effective looping of a subluxed IOL haptic or capsular tension ring. This technique can be performed without an assistant and prevents excessive manipulation and unnecessary explantation of dislocated IOL. The reverse suture technique is a safe, effective, and easily reproducible maneuver to refixate dislocated IOLs. &quot;</field>
