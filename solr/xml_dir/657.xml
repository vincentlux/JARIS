<field name="content">&quot;The Correlation Between Dry Eyes, Anxiety and Depression: The Sicca, Anxiety and Depression Study.&quot;,&quot;Physiological function and metabolic regulation are the most important outputs of circadian clock controls in mammals. Mitochondrial respiration and ROS production show rhythmic activity. Mitochondrial carriers, which are responsible for mitochondrial substance transfer, are vital for mitochondrial metabolism. Clock (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is the first core circadian gene identified in mammalian animals. However, whether CLOCK protein can regulate mitochondrial functions via mitochondrial carriers is unclear. Here, we showed that CLOCK can bind to the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10. For further analysis, we established a Slc25a10&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;-Hepa1-6 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Slc25a10&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;-Hepa1-6 cells showed disordered glucose homeostasis, increased oxidative stress levels, and damaged electron transport chains. Next, using an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that amino acids 43-84 and 169-210 in SLC25A10 are key sites that respond to CLOCK binding. Finally, forced expression of wild-type SLC25A10 in Slc25a10&lt;sup&gt;-/-&lt;/sup&gt;-Hepa1-6 cells could compensate for the loss of SLC25A10; the decreased glucose metabolism, severe oxidative stress and damaged electron transport chain were recovered. In addition, a mutant Slc25a10 with changes in two key sites did not show a rescue effect. In conclusion, we identified a new protein-protein interaction mechanism in which CLOCK can directly regulate cell metabolism via the mitochondrial membrane transporter SLC25A10. Our study might provide some new insights into the relationship between circadian clock and mitochondrial metabolism. &quot;</field>
