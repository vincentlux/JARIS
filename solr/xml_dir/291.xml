<field name="content">Anticoagulation: a practical guide for strabismus surgeons.,&quot;To evaluate laser &lt;i&gt;in situ&lt;/i&gt; keratomileusis (LASIK) flap thickness predictability and morphology by femtosecond (FS) laser and microkeratome (MK) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Fifty-two candidates for the LASIK procedure were stratified into two groups: FS laser-assisted (Allegretto FS-200) and MK flap creation (Moria 2). Flap thickness was determined at five points. The side-cut angle was measured in three directions at the margin interface. LASIK flap assessment was performed one month postoperatively by Spectralis anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Fifty-two patients (93 eyes) were recruited; 49 eyes were stratified to the FS group and 44 eyes to the MK group. The FS group had relatively even flap configurations, and the MK group had meniscus-shaped flaps. Mean differences between planned and actual flap thickness were 12.93  8.89 and 19.91  5.77 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively. In thin flaps (100 to 110 m), there was a significant disparity between the two groups (7.80  4.71 and 19.44  4.46 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively). However, in thicker flaps (130 m), comparable flap thickness disparity was achieved (18.54  9.52 and 20.83  5.99 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively). Mean side-cut angle was 74.29  5.79 degrees and 32.34  4.94 degrees in the FS and MK groups, respectively. Comparable flap thickness predictability was achieved in thicker flaps (130 m), while the FS laser technique yielded a more predictable result in thinner flaps (100 to 110 m). Different flap morphology was observed in meniscus flaps in MK-LASIK and flap morphology in FS-LASIK. &quot;</field>
