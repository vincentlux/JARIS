<field name="content">CANOMAD Presenting as Bilateral Sixth Nerve Palsies.,&quot;To assess the relationship between the meibomian gland loss (MGL) and relevant ocular surface clinical parameters as well as the influence of age in this relationship. A total of 161 participants (mean age; 4217 years) were enrolled in this study. Infrared meibography was performed using Keratograph 5M (K5M; Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar). Participants were divided into five groups according to total meiboscore and the ocular surface parameters of each MGL group were studied. In addition, the relationship between MGL and the ocular surface parameters was established including age as covariant. Both eyelids were taken into account since no association between the MGL from upper and lower eyelid was found (k value=0.2; p=0.3) despite they were significantly correlated (r= 0.3; p&lt;0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in symptomatology among different MGL groups. Statistically significant differences were found among MGL groups in tear osmolarity (p=0.02), bulbar redness (p=0.04), corneal and conjunctival staining (p=0.01 and p=0.004, respectively). Despite this, only corneal staining showed a significant correlation with MGL when age was covariant (r=0.2; p=0.04). MGL higher than 50% seems to be accompanied by signs on the ocular surface. Furthermore, age demonstrated to be a relevant factor when assessing MGL. For this reason, future studies should compare age-matched groups in order to know the contribution of the MGL on the ocular surface and establish valid cut-off values for dry eye diagnosis. &quot;</field>
