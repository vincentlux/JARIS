<field name="content">Outcomes of resident-performed small incision cataract surgery in a university-based practice in the USA.,&quot;Early diagnosis of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) is vital to improving outcomes in immunocompromised patients. This study evaluated the impact of a systematic protocol with nasal endoscopy and biopsies to early detect AIFRS in immunocompromised patients. Additionally, we compared the accuracy of frozen-section biopsy and culture with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy. Retrospective cohort in a Tertiary Referral Hospital. Patients with the suspected diagnosis of AIFRS were evaluated following a standardized protocol, including serial nasal endoscopies and biopsies when necessary. The sensitivity and specificity of frozen-section biopsy and culture were also compared with FFPE. The mortality rate related to AIFRS of this standardized cohort (13/43) was 30.2%. Better outcomes were observed in patients with disease limited to the turbinates and in those with higher peripheral neutrophils count. Frozen-section biopsy positivity correlated with FFPE findings for fungi detection (p-value&lt;0.0001), with a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 72.7%, and accuracy of 86.0%. Implementation of this standardized protocol was related to a considerably low mortality rate among patients with suspected AIFRS at our Institution. Frozen-section biopsy revealed high accuracy to diagnose AIFRS. The current protocol including frozen-tissue biopsy improved the evaluation and survival rates of immunocompromised patients with presumed AIFRS. &quot;</field>
