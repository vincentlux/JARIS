<field name="content">Purtscher&apos;s retinopathy in scleroderma.,&quot;To investigate changes in ocular perfusion following three consecutive intravitreal injections with aflibercept for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The study included 20 eyes from 20 Caucasian patients with unilateral nAMD and 20 fellow eyes. All nAMD eyes were treated with standard intravitreal injection of aflibercept (IVA; 2 mg). Measurements of ocular perfusion at the optic nerve head (ONH) and the choroid were performed with laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). Measurements were conducted at baseline, 1week after the first injection, at the time point of the second and third injection as well as 1 month after the third injection. In treated eyes, mean blur rate (the main output parameter of LSFG) in the ONH microvasculature and in the choroid was significantly reduced 1 week after the first IVA treatment. The effect persisted throughout the entire follow-up period (p&lt;0.001). No change in ocular perfusion was observed in fellow eyes. IVA for treatment of nAMD leads to a reduction in perfusion of the ONH and the choroid in the treated eye with no apparent effect on the fellow eye. &quot;</field>
