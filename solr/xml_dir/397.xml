<field name="content">Defunding preoperative histories and physical exams: putting the cart before the evidence?,&quot;To report the 52-week treatment outcomes with intravitreal injections of aflibercept using a treat-and-extend regimen for treating macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). A retrospective analysis of patients newly diagnosed with CRVO was performed. Patients receiving aflibercept between 1 December 2016 and 31 March 2017 were included in the analysis. Data on age, gender, visual acuity measured on Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, presence of macular and peripheral ischemia, anatomical changes observed on spectral domain-optical coherence tomography examination and the number of injections needed were recorded. The mean gain in vision was 17.8  19.1 ( standard deviation) letters and 15.1  20.2 letters at weeks 24 and 52 of follow-up, respectively. The proportion of patients who gained  15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity was 52.9% at week 24 and 50% at week 52. The mean reduction in central subfield macular thickness was 331.5 and 311.6 at weeks 24 and week 52, respectively. For the patients completing 52weeks of follow-up, the mean number of treatments was 4.91.3 injections in the first 26weeks and 3.22.0 injections in the second 26weeks. The Moorfields protocol for treating macula edema in CRVO achieves a quick response to treatment without over- or under-treating patients with a fixed protocol. Overall, our individualized treat-and-extend protocol achieved real-life outcomes approaching those of clinical trials. As there are currently no such trials using this practically useful regimen, our study provides real-world evidence for using a treat-and-extend protocol for aflibercept in CRVO. &quot;</field>
