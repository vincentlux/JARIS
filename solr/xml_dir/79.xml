<field name="content">Decision Making in Interventional Oncology: Ablative Options in the Lung.,"To evaluate the changes in T-cell balance in peripheral blood following percutaneous tumor ablation. Patients underwent thermal ablation including radiofrequency (n=9) and microwave ablation (n=5), or cryoablation (n=5). Target tumors were located in the lung (n=7), soft tissue (n=5), liver (n=4), and bone (n=3). Patient peripheral blood samples were collected before and within 14days after ablation. Peripheral blood populations of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL), type-1 (T<sub>h</sub>1) and type-2 helper T-cells (T<sub>h</sub>2), and regulatory T-cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) were measured using flow cytometry. Changes in CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 ratios before and after ablation therapy were compared using paired t-tests. Peripheral blood CTL population (27.52.1% to 30.22.5%, p<.03) and CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> ratios (18.83.7% to 21.63.6%, p<.05) increased significantly after ablation. Although a significant increase in CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> ratios was found after heat-based ablation (18.04.4% to 21.64.7%, p<.02), it remained unchanged after cryoablation (21.07.0% to 21.54.3%, p=.92). T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 ratio (13.73.0% to 17.23.5%, p=.12) remained unchanged after ablation. Ablation therapy alters the T-cell balance by increasing the systemic CTL/T<sub>reg,</sub> ratio. Heat-based ablation might be a more effective approach than cryoablation to enhance systemic anti-tumor immunity."
