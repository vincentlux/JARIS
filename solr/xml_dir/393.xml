<field name="content">Canadians with visual impairment utilize home care services more frequently.,&quot;The aim of this study was to perform an updated meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the association between G20210A polymorphism of Prothrombin gene and the risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), based on the available publications with inconsistent results. We utilized the Stata software to perform the heterogeneity test, association test, Begg&apos;s and Egger&apos;s tests, and sensitivity analysis. We searched three on-line databases (PubMed, Embase, and WOS) and obtained a total of 422 articles. Based on our selection criteria, 24 case-control studies were finally enrolled in this overall meta-analysis; a subgroup analysis by the factors ethnicity, control source, and RVO type was done. Through the association test of overall meta-analysis, we did not observe a significant difference between RVO cases and controls under the A vs G (allele) (z=1.49, P=0.137), A vs G (carrier) (z=1.42, P =0.155), GA vs GG (z=1.50, P=0.135), and GA+AA vs GG (z=1.50, P=0.135). Furthermore, we observed similar negative results in the association test of subgroup analysis (all P&gt;0.05). Heterogeneity, Begg&apos;s, and Egger&apos;s tests excluded the presence of high heterogeneity and publication bias. Statistically stable results were observed in the sensitivity analyses. Based on integrated analysis of the current evidence, Prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism is likely unrelated to the risk of RVO. &quot;</field>
