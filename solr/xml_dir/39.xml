<field name="content">&quot;Image-guided percutaneous renal cryoablation: Five years experience, results and follow-up.&quot;,&quot;To investigate the midterm safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous gallbladder cryoablation in swine. Three swine underwent gallbladder cryoablation. Cryoprobes were positioned percutaneously at the gallbladder margins or within the gallbladder lumen under CT guidance. Two freeze/thaw cycles were performed. One animal was euthanized on postprocedure day 4 as a result of hematemesis unrelated to the ablation. The other 2 animals were euthanized at postprocedure days 30 and 48, respectively. The gallbladder and bile ducts were resected and examined microscopically. Gallbladder cryoablation was completed with freeze/thaw cycle durations of 7.5-10 minutes (mean, 9.4 min  1.3) and ablation margins of 5.8-11.5 mm (mean, 7.8 mm  1.9). No nontarget ablation was observed. Laboratory values at postprocedure day 4 and the time of euthanasia were within normal limits. Two of 3 animals thrived and exhibited appropriate activity and weight gain. Contrast-enhanced CT immediately before euthanasia demonstrated delayed linear enhancement of the gallbladder wall. Gross inspection at autopsy revealed fibrotic-appearing gallbladders. Cholecystography revealed no communication to the biliary tree. Histologic examination demonstrated complete gallbladder wall fibrosis. Autopsy of the animal euthanized on day 4 revealed a gastric mucosal ulcer distant from the ablation site with no gastric serosal injury. Gallbladder cryoablation is a promising alternative to surgical cholecystectomy, with complete transmural gallbladder wall fibrosis and cystic duct occlusion seen at 30 and 48 days in swine. Further studies are required to establish procedural safety and long-term efficacy.&quot;</field>
