<field name="content">Focal and diffuse chronic central serous chorioretinopathy treated with half-dose photodynamic therapy or subthreshold micropulse laser.,&quot;To establish the extent of anterior chamber angle circumference needed to maintain a physiological outflow facility (C). This could create a model to investigate focal outflow regulation. Twenty anterior segments of porcine eyes were assigned to five groups, each with a different degree of cyanoacrylate-mediated angle closure: 90 (n=4), 180 (n=4), 270 (n=4), 360 (n=4), and four unoccluded control eyes. The outflow facility was measured at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36h after angle closure. Outflow patterns were evaluated with canalograms and the histomorphology was compared. Baseline outflow facilities of the five groups were similar (F=0.922, p=0.477). Occlusion of 360 induced a significant decrease in facility from baseline at all time-points (p0.023 at 3, 12, 24, and 36h). However, no difference from baseline was found in any of the partially occluded (0-270) groups (F0.067, p0.296 at 3, 12, 24, and 36h). The canalograms confirmed the extent of occlusion with flow through the unblocked regions. Histology revealed no adverse effects of blockage on the TM or aqueous plexus in the unoccluded angle portions. The unoccluded TM appeared normal. Cyanoacrylate-mediated angle occlusion created a reproducible angle closure model. Ninety degrees of unoccluded anterior chamber angle circumference was sufficient to maintain physiological outflow. This model may help understand how outflow can be regulated in healthy, nonglaucomatous TM. &quot;</field>
