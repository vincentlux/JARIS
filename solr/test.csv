Adherence to Optical Safety Guidelines for Laser-Assisted Hair Removal.,"In recent years, there was a rise in ocular injuries secondary to cosmetic laser-assisted hair removal. To assess the level of adherence to optical safety guidelines during laser-assisted hair removal performed by nurses or physicians in private practice. A cross-sectional study was conducted at thirty-one private laser-assisted hair removal clinics. An electronic random number generator using a cluster random sampling technique was used to select the clinics. The Alexlazr<sup>TM</sup> (Candela Corp., Wayland, MA, United States) device operator's manual checklist was modified to collect data from laser device operators and patients by surveying the laser rooms, interviewing the patients, and observing the treatments. Ninety-four patients treated by different service providers were included from 31 private centers. All treatment sessions were delivered by trained nurses. Only 9.5% had acceptable adherence to optical safety guidelines during hair removal treatment, while the majority (90.5%) of service providers were poorly adherent. None of the providers achieved excellent adherence to optical safety guidelines. The item with the least adherence was the lack of non-reflective floors inside laser rooms in 72.3% of centers. All service providers were familiar with the laser system controls and emergency shut down (100% adherence). There is a significant deficiency in the safety precautions at laser-assisted hair removal centers that can result in devastating ophthalmic injuries. Companies providing laser-assisted hair removal machines should be involved in aiding these centers to implement safety procedures. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. "
A case of X-linked retinoschisis with atypical fundus appearance.,"Mutations in the RS1 gene are known to cause retinoschisis, an X-linked hereditary retinal degeneration. Here, we present a case of atypical retinoschisis with clinical findings of retinoschisis and retinitis pigmentosa. This report is an observational case report. The detailed ophthalmological examinations included visual field determination, multimodal imaging and electrophysiological recordings. Targeted next-generation sequencing of a retinal disease gene panel was performed. The 55-year-old male, highly hyperopic patient, presented with a best-corrected Snellen visual acuity of 20/100 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left eye. In the kinetic visual field, there was a superior scotoma, as well as a ring scotoma in the inferior hemisphere in the right eye and a concentric visual field constriction to 10 in the left eye. Funduscopy revealed marked pigmentary changes (i.e. bone spicules) in the mid-periphery bilaterally and symmetrically, as well as two small intra-retinal haemorrhages in the left eye. Full-field electroretinography recordings showed extinguished rod and cone responses. Diagnostic-genetic testing revealed a hemizygous missense mutation in the RS1 gene (c.305G>A; p.Arg102Gln) was identified. We present a case of atypical retinoschisis with clinical findings of retinitis pigmentosa. "
Idiopathic third and sixth cranial nerve neuritis.,"To present cases with idiopathic third and sixth cranial nerve neuritis. Retrospective observational study METHODS: The results of high resolution pre- and post- cranial nerve magnetic resonance images (MRI) with three-dimensional sequences for visualizing cranial nerves in patients with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsies who were treated at the Neuro-ophthalmology Department of Samsung Medical Center were reviewed. Patients with cranial nerve enhancement confirmed by experienced radiologists were identified. The medical records of these patients were reviewed, and their demographics, clinical presentations, laboratory results, and clinical outcomes were analyzed. Of 265 patients with third, fourth, and sixth cranial nerve palsy, 60 were identified by high resolution MRI as having enhancement of the corresponding cranial nerve. Among these, 17 patients with infiltrative, granulomatous, or tumorous lesions were excluded. In addition, 28 patients with identifiable causes of cranial nerve palsy, such as Miller-fisher syndrome, virus infection, or radiation-induced neuropathy, as well as patients with vasculopathic risk factors, were also excluded. Ultimately, a total of 15 patients with idiopathic third and sixth cranial nerve neuritis were included in this study. The mean age of these patients was 43  15 years. Eight patients had sixth cranial nerve palsy, six third cranial nerve palsy (two partial and four complete), and one patient with complete third and sixth cranial nerve palsy. Nine patients received steroid treatment. Eleven patients recovered fully within a period ranging from a few days to one year. Two patients were much improved up to 1month after initial presentation, but were then ultimately lost to follow-up. Another patient was lost to follow-up after the initial work-up. The other patient lost to follow-up had partially recovered during the first 6months. We present patients with idiopathic third and sixth cranial nerve neuritis. They tended to respond well to steroid treatment and to have good prognoses. In order to better understand the long-term prognosis of cranial nerve neuritis and possible association with other neurologic disorders, a larger scale and longer-term study is needed. "
Comparison between refractive outcomes between macula-on and macula-off retinal detachments after phaco-vitrectomy.,"To evaluate axial length (AL) measurements and refractive outcomes in vitrectomy combined with cataract operation for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) with wholly detached macula. Retrospective, consecutive, comparative, clinical study. We reviewed the data of patients treated by vitrectomy combined with cataract operation for RRD. The group ""Attach"" (n=31) consisted of eyes in which retina was not detached within 1.5 disc diameters from the foveal center, and the group ""Detach"" (n=33) consisted of eyes in which that area was detached entirely. Only those eyes inthe group ""Detach"", only the eyes (n=20) which AL were measured similar to those fellow eyes were compared to the group ""Attach"" (n=31). Refractive shift (RS) was defined as the average of the difference between postoperative spherical equivalent (SE) and predicted SE. AL was well measured by A-scan ultrasonography (A-scan) in all 31 eyes of the group ""Attach"" and their RS was 0.57 diopters (D). AL was measured by A-scan similar to the fellow eye in 20 of 33 eyes (60.6%) of the group ""Detach"", and the RS was 0.09 D. The AL difference as much as central subfield macular thickness (about 300um) can make this difference of RS (0.48 D, P=0.025) CONCLUSION: When AL can be measured by A-scan similar to its fellow eye in RRD with wholly detached macula, RS would be smaller than that of the wholly attached macula after phacovitrectomy. It assumed that AL was measured from the RPE under the detached macula in RRD with wholly detached macula. "
Systemically modeling the relationship between climate change and wheat aphid abundance.,"Climate change influences all living beings. Wheat aphids deplete the nutritional value of wheat and affect the production of wheat in changing climate. In this study, we attempt to explain the ecological mechanisms of how climate change affects wheat aphids by simulating the relationship between climate and the abundance of wheat aphids, which will not only aid in improving wheat aphid forecasting and the effectiveness of prevention and treatment, but also help mitigate food crises. Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCM) are an effective tool for portraying complex systems. Using Sitobion avenae and climatological data collected in China, we made use of differential evolution (DE) algorithms to construct FCM models that directly illustrate the effect of climate on wheat aphid abundance. The relationships among climate and wheat aphids at different growth stages (I-III instar larvae, IV instar larvae with wings, IV instar larvae without wings, adult with wings, adult without wings) were established. The analysis results from the FCM models show that temperature positively influences wheat aphids most. Moreover, these models can be used to determine the numerical value of each climate factor and the abundance of wheat aphids quantitatively. Furthermore, the two overall relationship models between climate and wheat aphids were constructed and the experimental results show that natural enemies and highest daily temperature affect wheat aphids most. Natural enemies and highest daily temperature exert negative and positive impacts on wheat aphids respectively. Some interrelationships among wheat aphids at all growth stages and the internal relationships among climate factors were also shown. "
Phenomenological tissue fracture modeling for an Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery training system based on experimental data.,"The ideal simulator for Endoscopic Sinus and Skull Base Surgery (ESSS) training must be supported by a physical model and provide repetitive behavior in a controlled environment. Development of realistic tissue models is a key part of ESSS virtual reality (VR)-based surgical simulation. Considerable research has been conducted to address haptic or force feedback and propose a phenomenological tissue fracture model for sino-nasal tissue during surgical tool indentation. Mechanical properties of specific sino-nasal regions of the sheep head have been studied in various indentation and relaxation experiments. Tool insertion at different indentation rates into coronal orbital floor (COF) tissue is modeled as a sequence of three events: deformation, fracture, and cutting. The behavior in the deformation phase can be characterized using a non-linear, rate-dependent modified Kelvin-Voigt model. A non-linear model for tissue behavior prior to the fracture point is presented. The overall model shows a non-positive dependency of maximum force on tool indentation rate, which indicates faster tool insertion velocity decreases the maximum final fracture force. The tissue cutting phase has been modeled to characterize the force necessary to slice through the COF. The proposed model in this study can help develop VR-based ESSS base simulators in otolaryngology and ophthalmology surgeries. Such simulators are useful in preoperative planning, accurate surgical simulation, intelligent robotic assistance, and treatment applications. "
Psychological and Psychosocial Interventions for Depression and Anxiety in Patients With Age-Related Macular Degeneration: A Systematic Review.,"To review the current literature on psychosocial and psychological interventions to prevent and treat depression and anxiety in patients with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). The authors conducted a systematic review of literature evaluating psychosocial and psychological interventions for depression and anxiety in patients with AMD. Primary searches of PubMed, Cochrane library, EMBASE, Global Health, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Science Direct were conducted to include all articles published up to April 21, 2018. Of a total of 398 citations retrieved, the authors selected 12 eligible studies published between 2002 and 2016. The authors found nine randomized controlled trials (RCT), and three non-randomized intervention (NRI) studies. RCT studies suggested that interventions using group self-management techniques and individual behavioral activation plus low vision rehabilitation can be effective to treat and prevent depression in patients with AMD, and one study suggested that a stepped-care intervention using cognitive-behavioral techniques can be effective to manage anxiety and depression over time. NRI studies highlighted a positive effect of self-help and emotion-focused interventions to reduce depression. Clinical practice with patients with AMD can rely on some tailored cognitive-behavioral therapeutic protocols to improve patients' mental health, but further clinical trials will generate the necessary evidence-based knowledge to improve those therapeutic techniques and offer additional tailored interventions for patients with AMD.

[Panorama of limbal alterations].,"The corneal limbus is a privileged region on the border between two quite different microenvironments, where corneal epithelial stem cells, numerous melanocytes, and antigen-presenting cells are all concentrated within a richly vascularized and innervated stroma. This situation within the ocular surface confers on it the key functions of barrier, epithelial renewal and defense of the cornea. As an immunological crossroads and since the corneoscleral limbus is directly exposed to external insults such as caustic agents, ultraviolet radiation, microbial agents, and allergens, it is the potential site of many tumoral, degenerative or inflammatory pathologies and may progress under certain conditions to limbal stem cell deficiency.

Cataract formation after application of intense focused ultrasound for facial rejuvenation.,"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has made genetic testing of patients with epileptic encephalopathies easier - novel variants are discovered and new phenotypes described. Variants in the same gene - even the same variant - can cause different types of epilepsy and neurodevelopmental disorders. Our aim was to identify the genetic causes of epileptic encephalopathies in paediatric patients with complex phenotypes. NGS was carried out for three patients with epileptic encephalopathies. Detailed clinical features, brain magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography were analysed. We searched the Human Gene Mutation Database for the published GABRG2 variants with clinical description of patients and composed a summary of the variants and their phenotypic features. We identified two novel de novo GABRG2 variants, p.P282T and p.S306F, with new phenotypes including neuroradiological evidence of neurodegeneration and epilepsy of infancy with migrating focal seizures (EIMFS). One patient carried previously reported p.P83S variant with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) phenotype that has not yet been described related to GABRG2 disorders and a more severe epilepsy phenotype than reported earlier. In all, the literature search yielded twenty-two articles describing 27 different variants that were divided into two categories: those with self-limiting epilepsies and febrile seizures and those with more severe drug-resistant epileptic encephalopathies. This study further expands the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of epilepsies associated with GABRG2 variants. More knowledge is still needed about the influence of the environment, genetic background and other epilepsy susceptibility genes on the phenotype of the specific GABRG2 variants. "
Reply.,"Adult strabismus is often characterized by surgical complexity. In recent years, several innovative techniques for the management of complex strabismus have been developed. Strabismus surgeons should understand the indications for various strabismus surgical techniques in the management of these difficult cases. This workshop describes several new surgical techniques to manage complex strabismus, including small-angle incomitant and very large-angle strabismus, torsional diplopia, and restrictive, paralytic, and secondary strabismus. Because strabismus surgery is an ever-evolving field, it is important to continue to refine our surgical armamentarium. Strabismus surgeons may wish to add these techniques to their surgical repertoire for select cases. "
Re: Keenan etal.: Progression of geographic atrophy in age-related macular degeneration (Ophthalmology. 2018;125:1913-1928).,"To investigate retinal microvascular findings detected by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in amblyopic eyes compared with normal eyes. A total of 23 amblyopic (strabismic, ametropic, anisometropic, and meridional amblyopia) and 22 normal eyes were included in this prospective observational, comparative study. All patients underwent complete ophthalmological examination and OCT-A imaging. Vessel density (VD) percentage in the superficial and deep retinal vessel plexus, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, flow area in the outer retina and choriocapillaris, and retinal thickness in m in a 6.00  6.00 mm scan size were measured and compared between groups. There were no statistically significant differences between groups in terms of age (P = 0.584) and sex (P = 0.661). Mean FAZ area was smaller in the amblyopic group; however, the difference was not statistically significant (P = 0.145). The outer retina flow area was significantly wider in the amblyopic group (P = 0.03). The fovea was thicker in the amblyopic group (P = 0.02). In addition, VD in both the superficial and deep retinal plexus was significantly lower in amblyopic eyes in all quadrants except the fovea. In amblyopic subgroups, VD of anisometropic amblyopic eyes was significantly higher than other subgroups in both superficial and deep retinal plexuses at all regions except the fovea. Other measures were similar in between groups. Microvascular retinal structural anomalies detectable on OCT-A could shed further light on the causes of amblyopia. "

Reply.,"To determine the frequency of receded near point of convergence (NPC) in patients with chronic concussion-related symptoms, and among those with receded NPC to enumerate the frequency of convergence insufficiency and other oculomotor disorders. Design: Retrospective cross-sectional study METHODS: Clinic charts were retrospectively reviewed for the prior 3.5 years to identify all patients <21 years old who were >28 days post-concussion, had chronic concussion-related symptoms, had normal visual acuity, and received a comprehensive sensorimotor examination. The frequency of receded NPC and oculomotor diagnoses were determined. Of the 83 eligible patients, 74 (89%) had receded NPC. Of these, 70 (95%) had oculomotor disorders; 30 (41%) had disorders of accommodation only, 21 (28%) had convergence insufficiency and accommodation deficits, and 6 (8%) had convergence insufficiency only. Six (8%) had a convergence deficit other than convergence insufficiency (all with concurrent accommodative disorders), 4 (5%) had both a non-specific vergence dysfunction and accommodation deficits, 2 (3%) had convergence excess only, and 1 (1%) had both convergence excess and accommodative deficits. A receded NPC was present in the majority of young patients with chronic post-concussion symptoms. Associated with numerous underlying oculomotor dysfunctions, the clinical finding of a receded NPC is not synonymous with the diagnosis of convergence insufficiency. Because treatment options for the various oculomotor dysfunctions differ, it is prudent that these patients undergo a thorough examination of their vergence and accommodative systems so that an accurate diagnosis can be made and appropriate treatment prescribed.

Reply.,"The pathophysiology of non-arteritic AION (N-AION) is not completely understood. Studies of the retinal vasculature phenotype in patients with N-AION could help us to understand vascular abnormalities associated with the disease. Retrospective case series with matched controls. Study population: 57 patients with N-AION and 57 controls matched to N-AION patients for sex, age, systemic hypertension, diabetes and obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, between September 2007 and July 2017. All patients and control subjects underwent a complete ocular examination and 45-degree funduscopic color photographs. The widths of the six largest arteries in zone B (between 0.5 and 1 optic disc diameter from the optic disc), summarized by the central retinal artery equivalent (CRAE), the widths of the six largest veins in zone B, summarized by the central retinal vein equivalent (CRVE), the arteriole-tovenule ratio (AVR), tortuosity and fractal dimension (FD) were measured on the two groups using VAMPIRE (Vessel Assessment and Measurement Platform for Images of the Retina), a software tool for efficient semi-automatic quantification of the retinal vasculature morphology in fundus camera images. Univariate analysis using the Student t-test and MacNemar Chi-squared test for paired sample and Generalized Estimated Equations for modeling the VAMPIRE parameters as dependent variables were used. CRVE and FD (D0a) were significantly higher in the N-AION group when compared with the control group, whereas the AVR and vascular tortuosity were significantly lower. In comparison with controls, acute N-AION yielded increased CRAE value (174 33 vs. 160 13 m) while resolution N-AION yielded decreased CRAE value (152 12 vs. 156 33 m). Acute N-AION yielded increased CRVE value (244 35 vs. 210 21 m) while resolution N-AION yielded unchanged CRVE value. We found no difference between groups for age, refraction, optic disc diameter, CRAE, and FD. Retinal vascular parameters were different in our sample between N-AION and control patients, especially at the acute stage of the disease. Our results suggest a normalization of the same parameters at the resolution stage. "
Re: Biousse etal.: Management of acute retinal ischemia: Follow the guidelines! (Ophthalmology. 2018;125:1597-1607).,"To compare the effect of age, sex and generation on physician practice patterns in Ontario, Canada. Retrospective cohort study. Physician and patient data from 1992-2013 were used to calculate yearly number of physicians, distinct patients seen, patient visits, government payments, physician age, sex, specialty and year of birth. Age-period-cohort models were used for analysis. There was a negligible change in the number of distinct patients for all physicians and family physicians and a 20.6% decrease for ophthalmologists. There were small declines in yearly visits for all physicians (14.2%) and family physicians (17.3%) and a 10.0% increase for ophthalmologists. There was a lower number of visits (and patients for ophthalmologists) in each succeeding recent birth cohort. For all groups and birth cohorts, male physicians had significantly greater number of visits and patients. Median payments increased over time in all groups and were less for women with an average women-to-men ratio of 0.64 for all physicians, 0.75 for family physicians and 0.59 for ophthalmologists. After adjusting for the number of visits and patients, sex differences in payments remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists but were no longer significant for family physicians. Younger cohorts of Ontario physicians have greater yearly payments compared to older cohorts at the same age despite similar or slightly less number of visits and patients. The sex gap of payments was mostly explained by differences in the number of patients and visits for family physicians however remained significant for all physicians and ophthalmologists. "
Re: Biousse etal.: Management of acute retinal ischemia (Ophthalmology. 2018;125:1597-1607).,"JBTS17 is a major gene mutated in ciliopathies such as Joubert syndrome and oral-facial-digital syndrome type VI. Most patients with loss of function mutations in JBTS17 exhibit cerebellar vermis hypoplasia and brain stem malformation. However, some patients with JBTS17 mutations show microcephaly and abnormal gyration. We examined potential roles of JBTS17 in neurogenesis to understand the pathological mechanism of JBTS17-related cortical abnormalities. We examined subcellular localization and cell cycle-dependent expression of JBTS17 proteins using anti-JBTS17 antibodies and JBTS17 expression vectors. We also performed knockdown experiments to determined roles of JBTS17 in human cells, and demonstrated mitotic functions of JBTS17 using immunostaining and live imaging. We examined the involvement of JBTS17 in cortical neurogenesis using mouse in utero electroporation technique. We found that JBTS17 localizes to the kinetochore and the level of JBTS17 is regulated by cell cycle-dependent proteolysis. Depletion of JBTS17 disrupts chromosome alignment and spindle pole orientation, resulting in mitotic delay. JBTS17 interacts with LIS1 and influences LIS1 localization. Depletion of Jbts17 in the developing mouse cortex interferes with the mitotic progression of neural progenitors and the migration of postmitotic neurons. LIS1 is implicated in lissencephaly, but altered dosage of LIS1 has been also associated with microcephaly syndromes. Our results suggest that JBTS17 contributes to mitotic progression by interacting with LIS1, and abnormal mitosis is an underlying mechanism of the microcephaly phenotype in JBTS17-related ciliopathies. We propose that understanding extraciliary roles of ciliopathy proteins is important to elucidate pathological mechanisms underlying diverse ciliopathy phenotypes.

Reply.,"Subretinal delivery of stem cell-derived retinal cells as a strategy to treat retinal degenerative blindness holds great promise. Currently, two clinical trials are underway in which human fetal retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) are being delivered to patients by intravitreal or subretinal injection to preserve or restore vision, respectively. With the advent of the induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC), and in turn three-dimensional derivation of retinal tissue, it is now possible to generate autologous RPCs for cell replacement. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of commonly used cell isolation and surgical manipulation strategies on donor cell viability. iPSC-RPCs were subjected to various conditions including different dissociation and isolation methods, injection cannula sizes, and preinjection storage temperatures and times. The effects of commonly used surgical techniques on both host and donor cell viability were evaluated in Yucatan mini-pigs (n=61 eyes). We found a significant increase in cell viability when papain was used for RPC isolation. In addition, a significant decrease in cell viability was detected when using the 41G cannula compared with 31G and at storage times of 4 hours compared with 30minutes. Although 96.4% of all eyes demonstrated spontaneous retinal reattachment following injection, retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) abnormalities were seen more frequently in eyes receiving injections via a 31G cannula; interestingly, eyes that received cell suspensions were relatively protected against such RPE changes. These findings indicate that optimization of donor cell isolation and delivery parameters should be considered when developing a subretinal cell replacement strategy.

Unilateral Papilledema as the Presenting Sign of Spinal Metastases.,"The aim of this study was to assess the incidence of persistent postoperative cystoid macular edema (pCME) in patients undergoing pars plana vitrectomy with epiretinal membrane peel (ERM) only versus those with ERM peel combined with internal limiting membrane peel (ILM). Secondary endpoints of the study were to review both the central macular thickness (CMT) and visual acuity. The patients were divided in two groups, one group in which only the ERM was peeled (n=36 patients) and another group in which both the ERM and the ILM were removed (n=62 patients). The results were analyzed retrospectively. Each patient received a complete ophthalmological examination, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) using an ETDRS chart and spectral domain optical coherence tomography, at three time points: prior to surgery and 3 weeks and 3 months after surgery. A total 98 eyes of 98 patients were included in this study. The mean follow-up time was 7.7months. CMT decreased significantly after surgery in all patients, and none of these changes differed significantly between the two groups. The BCVA increased significantly after surgery across all patients, and there were no significant changes between the two treatment groups. Postoperative pCME occurred in eight patients in each group, representing 22.2% of the 36 patients in the ERM only group and 12.9% of the 62 patients in the ERM/ILM peel group. However, this difference was not statistically significant. No difference was found between the two groups in terms of incidence of pCME. Both groups experienced had similar decrease in the CMT and improvement in the BCVA postoperatively. "
Breast Metastases Masquerading as Cellulitis.,"The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of allogeneic cultured limbal epithelial transplantation (ACLET) and cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET) in treating total limbal stem cell deficiency (LSCD). In this retrospective cohort study, 73 patients (76 eyes) with total LSCD, including 41 patients (42 eyes) treated with ACLET and 32 patients (34 eyes) receiving COMET, were evaluated. The age, gender and injury cause of all patients were recorded. The mean follow-up was 23.39.9months in the ACLET group and 16.15.8months in the COMET group. A higher incidence of persistent epithelial defect was observed after COMET (P=0.023). The overall ocular surface grading scores were all lower in the ACLET group than in the COMET group at 3, 6, and 12months after surgery and the last follow-up. Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis demonstrated a significantly higher success rate of ACLET (71.4%), compared with that of COMET (52.9%; P=0.043). The risk of graft failure was higher in patients with entropion and trichiasis, incomplete eyelid closure and treated with COMET. The graft failure risk rate after COMET was 3.5 times higher than that of ACLET. For total LSCD patients, ACLET should be prioritized, since limbal epithelial cells have better ability to maintain corneal epithelial integrity and ocular surface stability and benefit the ocular surface when compared with oral mucosal epithelial cells. Preoperative and postoperative eyelid abnormalities should be corrected as early as possible. "
"Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Injections for Diabetic Retinopathy: Continued Progress, More Questions.","The sclera as well as the cornea forms the principal part of the outer fibrous coat of the eye, with a primary function of protecting the intraocular contents and maintaining the shape of the globe. However, the exact morphometric arrangement of scleral fibroblasts remains unclarified. The aim of this study was to observe the three-dimensional structure of the mouse scleral fibroblasts by focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy (FIB/SEM). Four eyes from C57BL/6J mice were fixed using a mixture of glutaraldehyde and formaldehyde. The sclera was cut out at the equatorial portion and the posterior pole, and postfixed with potassium ferrocyanide, osmium, thiocarbohydrazide, uranyl acetate and lead aspartate. Specimens were then dehydrated and embedded in an epoxy resin. Serial block face images were obtained using FIB/SEM. Three-dimensional image reconstruction and segmentation of the image stack were created using computer software (Amira v6.0.1, FEI). Scleral fibroblasts were arranged in collagenous layers. The cells frequently showed a cellular junction with the neighboring cells and formed cellular networks. Compared with equatorial fibroblasts, there was a more complicated cellular arrangement of the posterior scleral fibroblasts. "
Sectoral Choroidal Hypopigmentation.,"We present an objective and quantitative approach for diagnosing internuclear ophthalmoplegia (INO) in multiple sclerosis (MS). A validated standardized infrared oculography protocol (DEMoNS [Demonstrate Eye Movement Networks with Saccades]) was used for quantifying prosaccades in patients with MS and healthy controls (HCs). The versional dysconjugacy index (VDI) was calculated, which describes the ratio between the abducting and adducting eye. The VDI was determined for peak velocity, peak acceleration, peak velocity divided by amplitude, and area under the curve (AUC) of the saccadic trajectory. We calculated the diagnostic accuracy for the several VDI parameters by a receiver operating characteristic analysis comparing HCs and patients with MS. The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire-25 was used to investigate vision-related quality of life of MS patients with INO. Two hundred ten patients with MS and 58 HCs were included. The highest diagnostic accuracy was achieved by the VDI AUC of 15 horizontal prosaccades. Based on a combined VDI AUC and peak velocity divided by amplitude detection, the prevalence of an INO in MS calculated to 34%. In the INO group, 35.2% of the patients with MS reported any complaints of double vision, compared to 18.4% in the non-INO group (<i>p</i> = 0.010). MS patients with an INO had a lower overall vision-related quality of life (median 89.9, interquartile range 12.8) compared to patients without an INO (median 91.8, interquartile range 9.3, <i>p</i> = 0.011). This study provides an accurate quantitative and clinically relevant definition of an INO in MS. This infrared oculography-based INO standard will require prospective validation. The high prevalence of INO in MS provides an anatomically well described and accurately quantifiable model for treatment trials in MS. "
Acute Angle Closure Glaucoma in Von Hippel-Lindau Syndrome.,"It is currently unclear if longstanding type 1 diabetes (T1D) affects bone mineral density (BMD). BMD measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and history of fragility fracture was determined in 75 T1D participants with 50years of diabetes duration and 75 age- and sex-matched non-diabetic controls. BMD T-scores were determined for the lumbar spine (LS), total hip (TH) and femoral neck (FN). T1D participants had median diabetes duration of 54 [52, 58] years, 41 (55%) were females, and mean A<sub>1c</sub> was 7.30.8%. T1D females had higher LS T-scores compared to female controls (-0.31.2 vs. -1.11.4, p=0.014), lower FN T-scores (-1.51.0 vs. -1.20.9, p=0.042) and more fragility fractures (7 (17%) vs. 1 (2%), p=0.021). In T1D, higher A1c was associated with higher adjusted odds of fragility fracture (p=0.006). T1D males and controls showed no difference in BMD or fractures. There were no substantial differences in T-score between T1D and matched controls; however, T1D females showed higher BMD at the LS and possibly paradoxically higher fragility fractures compared to matched controls. These findings suggest that lower T-scores may not be associated with a history of fragility fracture in females with longstanding T1D and that other factors should be investigated. "
In Support of Ophthalmology-Specific Patient-Reported Outcome Measures.,"Children with conversion disorder experience neurological symptoms without a definable organic cause. Clinical presentation of conversion disorders is uncommon in the emergency department (ED). An 11-year-old previously healthy girl presented to the ED for management of lobar pneumonia. She developed acute visual loss subsequent to accidental placement of an intra-arterial cannula in her arm. Clinical assessments by the emergency physician, neurology, ophthalmology, and psychiatry services, and negative neuroimaging studies established the diagnosis of functional visual loss as a manifestation of conversion disorder. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: Conversion disorder symptoms are often without any specific markers and do not fit standard clinical guidelines. A comprehensive and step-wise evaluation of unusual clinical presentation by multiple specialties and ancillary test results should be considered to rule out organic causes and establish the diagnosis of conversion disorder, as seen in our patient.

Describing Retinopathy of Prematurity: Current Limitations and New Challenges.,"To study the effect of glistenings on the optical quality of a hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens (IOL). David J. Apple Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany. An invitro laboratory study. An accelerated aging protocol was used to induce glistenings (microvacuoles) in 38 hydrophobic acrylic IOLs. The IOLs were warmed to 45C and then cooled to 37C. Image analysis of light-microcopy photographs determined the number and size of microvacuoles (MV). A classification was applied based on the glistening number per mm<sup>2</sup>: grade 0 (none), grade 1 (1-100), grade 2 (101-200), grade 3 (201-500) and grade 4 (more than 500). An optical bench was used to measure each IOL's modulation transfer function (MTF) and Strehl ratio to evaluate the impact of glistenings on image quality. Glistenings were observed in all IOLs. The mean glistening numbersSD (MV/mm<sup>2</sup>) in grades 1 through 4 were 7412.7, 14222.2, 29776.2, and 1509311.9, respectively. The mean glistening sizes in grades 1 through 4 were 13.283.85m, 15.882.08m, 16.853.23m, and 15.272.25m, respectively. Statistical analysis showed thatgrades 1 through 3 did not change the optical quality; however,in grade 4, the MTF and the Strehl ratio were significantly affected. A limited number of glistenings (<500MV/mm<sup>2</sup>) had no effect on the image quality. Although statistically significant deteriorations in the MTF and the Strehl ratio were observed in grade 4, the effects found were small and are unlikely to affect the visual quality. "
Painful Dry Eye Symptoms: A Nerve Problem or a Tear Problem?,"To use ray-tracing analysis and simulated retinal illumination profiles to design an intraocular lens (IOL) that prevents or reduces negative dysphotopsia after cataract surgery. Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and Simpson Optics LLC, Arlington, Texas, USA. Experimental study. Ray-tracing software was used to simulate peripheral retina illumination from an extended light source for a pseudophakic eye with a biconvex high refractive index IOL. Ray intensities were adjusted to include the effects of the surface reflections and the energy reduction caused by pupil obliquity at high incident angles. The results were compared with similar optical modeling of a modified IOL design with a concave region on the peripheral posterior surface. For a standard biconvex high refractive index IOL, simulated retina illumination profiles showed an area of nonilluminated peripheral nasal retina at a relative visual angle of approximately 85 degrees to 93 degrees. Using a modified IOL optic with a peripheral concave posterior surface, ray-tracing diagrams showed that peripheral input rays were redirected anteriorly into the nonilluminated dark area of the peripheral retina. Simulated retina illumination images confirmed that the redirected input rays improved illumination to the peripheral retina, including the dark area. Optical modeling showed that the new IOL design provides more uniform illumination of the peripheral nasal retina and specifically illuminates the dark region of the nasal retina associated with negative dysphotopsia. This modified IOL design could prevent or reduce negative dysphotopsia after cataract surgery. "
Novel variants and phenotypes widen the phenotypic spectrum of GABRG2-related disorders.,"Nanoparticles (NPs) conjugated with aptamers have been extensively in recent years, which can efficiently target cancer cells that improve the therapeutic effect. Aptamers (Apt) are small oligonucleotide molecule ligands have specific high-affinity. In this work, we developed a PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated with doxorubicin. The NPs were modified with C2NP , a ssDNA aptamer specifically binding to CD30 protein which was over expressed in anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) cells. PEG-PLGA nanoparticles (NPs) were formed by nanoprecipitation and loaded with doxorubicin, further conjugated C2NP aptamer via an EDC/NHS technique. Obtained results demonstrated that the targeted agent was successfully conjugated confirming by Urea PAGE and XPS. The physicochemical properties of Apt-DOX-NPs like particle size at 168.072.72 nm and zeta potential at -30.760.153 mV. The time of the release drugs was efficiently increased in targeted formulations and showed higher accumulation in ALCL cells than non-targeted system. Findings from this work demonstrated the potential efficacy of C2NP-functionalized nanoparticles for a therapy in ALCL. "
Innovative techniques for the treatment of adult strabismus.,"To determine whether patient satisfaction with oral sedation is non-inferior to intravenous (IV) sedation for cataract surgery. A prospective, randomized, double-masked clinical trial. A volunteer sample of patients age 18 or older from diverse ethnic, racial, and socioeconomic backgrounds scheduled for cataract surgery. Patients were excluded if they were allergic to benzodiazepines, over the age of 70 and failed a delirium screening questionnaire, pregnant or nursing, using a medication inhibiting cytochrome 450 3A, or intoxicated on the day of surgery. Patients were randomized to receive either oral triazolam with IV placebo or IV midazolam with oral placebo preoperatively. The primary outcome was patient satisfaction, measured by a survey administered on postoperative day 1. Secondary outcomes included surgeon and anesthesia provider satisfaction, need for supplemental anesthesia, and surgical complications. Among the 85 patients (42 [49.4%] men; mean [SD] age, 65.8 [9.5]) completing the study, the mean patient satisfaction score was 5.34  0.63 (range 3.75 to 6) in the oral sedation group and 5.40  0.52 (range 4 to 6) in the IV group. With an a priori non-inferiority margin of 0.5 and a difference in mean scores between the two groups of 0.06 (one-tailed, 95% CI, -infinity to 0.27), our results demonstrate non-inferiority of oral sedation with a p-value of 0.0004. Surgeon and anesthesia provider satisfaction was similar between the two groups. Intraoperative complications occurred in 16.7% in the oral group and 9.3% in the IV group (difference 7.4%; 95% CI, -6.9% to 21.6%; p=0.31). The only major intraoperative complication - a posterior capsular tear - occurred in the IV group. Eight patients in the oral group (19.0%) and 3 in the IV group (7.0%) received supplemental IV sedation (difference 12.1%; 95% CI, -2.0% to 26.2%; p=0.097). The use of oral sedation in cataract surgery has been suggested as a cost- and space-saving measure, potentially allowing the transition of some cases from an operating to procedure room or office-based setting. We report the non-inferiority of oral compared with IV sedation for cataract surgery in a diverse patient population in terms of patient satisfaction. "
Microvascular changes in amblyopic eyes detected by optical coherence tomography angiography.,"Aim of the study was to compare optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) and conventional fluorescein angiography (FA) for quantitative analysis of the retinal and choroidal vasculature in the animal model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV). Therefore, Dark Agouti rats underwent argon laser photocoagulation to induce CNV at D0. In vivo imaging using combined confocal scanner laser ophthalmoscopy (cSLO)-based FA and OCT-A (Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was performed before and immediately after laser treatment as well as at day 2, 7, 14 and 21. OCT-A en-face images were compared to cSLO images obtained by conventional FA topographic uptake recorded using a series of different pre-defined focus settings. For a quantitative comparison of CNV imaging by OCT-A and FA, CNV area, vessel density, number of vessel junctions, total vessel length and number of vessel end points were analyzed. Subsequent ex vivo analyses of the CNV included immunofluorescence staining of vessels in retinal and RPE/choroidal/scleral flatmount preparations. We found, that OCT-A allowed for high-resolution non-invasive imaging of the superficial, intermediate and deep retinal capillary plexus as well as the choroidal blood vessels in rats. Compared with OCT-A, visualization of CNV progression by invasive FA was less accurate, in particular the deep vascular plexus was visualized in more detail by OCT-A. The area of neovascularization was mainly detected in the deep retinal vascular plexus, outer nuclear layer (ONL), ellipsoid zone (EZ) and the choroid. Within the laser lesions, signs of CNV formation occurred at day 7 with progression in size and number of small vessels until day 21. Due to leakage and staining effects, CNV areas appeared significantly larger in FA compared to OCT-A images (p0.0001 for all tested layers). Vessel density, number of vessel junctions, total vessel length and number of vessel end points were significantly higher in intermediate vascular plexus (IVP) and deep vascular plexus (DVP) in OCT-A compared to FA images. Overall, CNV area in flatmounts was similar to OCT-A results and much smaller compared to the area of dye leakage by FA. This study demonstrates that in vivo OCT-A imaging in small animals is feasible and allows for precise analysis of the formation of new blood vessel formation in the animal model of laser-induced CNV. Given its superior axial resolution, sensitivity and non-invasiveness compared to conventional FA imaging, OCT-A opens the door for a more detailed evaluation of CNV development in such a model and, thus, enables the analysis of the response to novel therapeutic interventions in longitudinal in vivo studies.

Strength of association between pentosan polysulfate and a novel maculopathy.,"A single pool of multipotent retinal progenitor cells give rise to the diverse cell types within the mammalian retina. Such cellular diversity is due to precise control of various cellular processes like cell specification, proliferation, differentiation, and maturation. Circadian clock genes can control the expression of key regulators of cell cycle progression and therefore can synchronize the cell cycle state of a heterogeneous population of cells. Here we show that the protein encoded by the circadian clock gene brain and muscle arnt-like protein-1 (<i>Bmal1</i>) is expressed in the embryonic retina and is required to regulate the timing of cell cycle exit. Accordingly, loss of <i>Bmal1</i> during retinal neurogenesis results in increased S-phase entry and delayed cell cycle exit. Disruption in cell cycle kinetics affects the timely generation of the appropriate neuronal population thus leading to an overall decrease in the number of retinal ganglion cells, amacrine cells, and an increase in the number of the late-born type II cone bipolar cells as well as the Mller glia. Additionally, the mislocalized Mller cells are observed in the photoreceptor layer in the <i>Bmal1</i> conditional mutants. These changes affect the functional integrity of the visual circuitry as we report a significant delay in visual evoked potential implicit time in the retina-specific <i>Bmal1</i> null animals. Our results demonstrate that <i>Bmal1</i> is required to maintain the balance between the neural and glial cells in the embryonic retina by coordinating the timing of cell cycle entry and exit. Thus, <i>Bmal1</i> plays an essential role during retinal neurogenesis affecting both development and function of the mature retina.-Sawant, O. B., Jidigam, V. K., Fuller, R. D., Zucaro, O. F., Kpegba, C., Yu, M., Peachey, N. S., Rao, S. The circadian clock gene <i>Bmal1</i> is required to control the timing of retinal neurogenesis and lamination of Mller glia in the mouse retina. "
Post-Concussion: Receded Near Point of Convergence is Not Diagnostic of Convergence Insufficiency.,"Corneal neovascularization (CNV), a pathological process of angiogenesis, can lead to serious consequences in the cornea. CNV is generally proved to associate with inflammation in the cornea closely, which is mainly elicited by the disruption of equilibrium between angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors. Angiogenic factors including vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs), basic fibroblast growth factors (bFGFs) and matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are vital factors in the formation of CNV. Especially VEGFs are convinced to be the core angiogenic factors in CNV, and MMPs are proved to exert dual effects on the process. Strikingly, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) are determined to play key roles in the formation of CNV, while the mechanism is still vague. In this review, the latest researches are reviewed to discuss the role of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in CNV respectively and some inhibitors of them are presented. We hope to provide a new direction of drug research for CNV. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. "
Retinal Vessel Phenotype in Patients with Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.,"This study was performed to evaluate the effect of topical 1% cyclopentolate hydrochloride on tear production (STT), intraocular pressure (IOP), and vertical pupil diameter (VPD) in healthy Turkman horses. Forty eyes of 20 clinically normal horses were used for this study, which were randomly assigned to two groups. Before instillation of 1% cyclopentolate, the baseline STT, IOP, and VPD of each group were recorded. Then, one drop of cyclopentolate was instilled randomly into one eye of each animal, and the contralateral eye served as control. Measurements were repeated at 20minutes, 60minutes, 90minutes, 120minutes, 12hours, and 24hours, and every 24hours up to 120hours post drug instillation in all animals. There was no significant effect on STT over the time course measured in both the treated and untreated eyes of the treatment groups after unilateral instillation of 1% cyclopentolate when compared to baseline values. A significant increase in the IOP was observed after 20minutes, which persisted for more than 90minutes; then, the IOP insignificantly decreased below the baseline values after 120minutes. Maximum VPD was recognized at 12hours post instillation in treated eyes (15.8  2.3mm), which was significantly different in comparison to the baseline (P= .07). Cyclopentolate could be considered as a long term and potent cycloplegic drug in horses when taking into account the possible side effect of atropine. "
"Influence Of Age, Sex And Generation On Physician Payments And Clinical Activity In Ontario, Canada: An Age-Period-Cohort Analysis.","Limited data exist on real-world treatment patterns for diabetic macular edema (DME) in Korea. In this study, we investigated DME treatment patterns from 2009 to 2014 and the impact of baseline treatment on healthcare resource utilization and visual acuity (VA) outcomes. A retrospective cohort chart review of DME patients treated at 11 hospital ophthalmology clinics between January 1, 2012 and December 31, 2013 was conducted. We collected data on demographics, healthcare resource utilization (clinic visits, treatment visits, and visits for ocular investigations), distribution of DME treatments, and VA. Overall, 522 DME patients (men, 55.2%; mean age, 59 years; mean HbA1c [n = 209], 8.4%) with 842 DME eyes were evaluated. For all treatments, healthcare resource utilization was significantly higher during the first 6 months versus months 7-12, year 2, or year 3 (<i>P</i>  0.001), but was highest for patients whose first treatment was an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) treatment (visits/quarter; anti-VEGF, 1.9; corticosteroids, 1.7; laser, 1.4). Use of macular laser therapy decreased (44% to 8%), whereas use of anti-VEGF injections increased (44% to 69%) during the study period. However, VA improvement was not commensurate with healthcare resource utilization of anti-VEGF treatment (mean VA gain, 2.7 letters). A trend toward increasing use of intravitreal anti-VEGF injections for DME treatment was observed in Korea. However, the frequency of dosing and monitoring was lower in clinical practice versus major clinical trials, which may have led to the less-than-favorable improvements in visual outcomes. "
Extraciliary roles of the ciliopathy protein JBTS17 in mitosis and neurogenesis.,"To determine whether geodemographic factors, specifically age, gender or commuting distance, affect the attendance rates of patients referred to a Diabetic Retinopathy Treatment (DRT) Centre from the Irish National Diabetic Retinal Screening (DRS) Programme. A retrospective analysis of the first 1200 patients who were referred for ophthalmic assessment between November 2013 and June 2015 to Cork University Hospital's (CUH) DRT clinic from the DRS was completed. A total of 972 (81%) patients attended all their scheduled DRT appointments. The attendance rates for those living in counties Cork and Kerry were 83.9% and 72.5%, respectively. Fifty-seven (4.75%) patients failed to attend any of their clinic appointments (2.2% of Cork and 11.8% of Kerry referrals). Patients living within 60km of the treatment centre were more likely to attend (p=0.013). Both age and gender were also shown to have a statistically significant impact on attendance, with those under 40years of age (p<0.001) and male patients (p=0.02) less likely to attend their scheduled appointments. This study suggests a correlation between geodemographic factors (age, gender and commuting distance) and attendance at a DRT Centre. The longer commuting distance for Kerry patients contributes to their higher non-attendance rates indicating a need to provide a Kerry-based satellite treatment centre to improve accessibility. "
Optimizing Donor Cellular Dissociation and Subretinal Injection Parameters for Stem Cell-Based Treatments.,"Cholesterol 24-hydroxylation is the major mechanism for cholesterol removal from the brain and the reaction catalyzed by cytochrome P450 46A1 (CYP46A1), a CNS-specific enzyme. This review describes CYP46A1 in the context of cholesterol homeostasis in the brain and summarizes available experimental data on CYP46A1 association with different neurologic diseases, including the mechanisms by which changes in the CYP46A1 activity in the brain could be beneficial for these diseases. The modulation of CYP46A1 activity by genetic and pharmacologic means is also presented along with a brief synopsis of the two clinical trials that evaluate CYP46A1 as a therapeutic target for Alzheimer's disease as well as Dravet and Lennox-Gastaut syndromes.

Outcomes after Epiretinal Membrane Surgery with or Without Internal Limiting Membrane Peeling.,"The purpose of the study was to describe findings demonstrated by anterior segment spectral domain optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in various types of deeply embedded corneal foreign bodies. In this experimental study, an ex vivo model of calf eyes was used and seven different foreign bodies were deeply embedded in the cornea, consisting of five different materials: glass, plastic, metal, wood, and pencil graphite. The eyes were photographed and then scanned by AS-OCT. The images were analyzed to determine distinguishing characteristics for each material. Various materials presented unique characteristics in AS-OCT. The opaque materials (pencil graphite, metals, and wood) demonstrated a hyper-reflective anterior border, whereas the posterior border signal could not be clearly identified due to the shadowing effect. Moreover, a chain of signals was characteristic of both pencil graphite and metals though a ""mirroring effect"" was unique for metals. Wood, as an opaque material, appears as a hyper-reflective mass with a spectrum of penetrability depending on the degree of concentration. Transparent materials demonstrated hyper-reflective sharp borders when surrounded by air or fluid, as opposed to when being embedded purely in the corneal stroma. This study shows that AS-OCT was used to systematically define a novel set of distinguishing characteristics specific to various materials extruding from the cornea, fully embedded in the cornea, and intruding into the anterior chamber. Hopefully, the described characteristics of each material can aid clinicians in diagnosing the type of the material embedded and the depth of its involvement in ocular injury. "
Comparison of the efficacy of different cell sources for transplantation in total limbal stem cell deficiency.,"To evaluate the anatomic versus functional changes in diabetic retinopathy (DR) by studying the correlation of retinal vascular perfusion density and dark adaptation (DA). Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and DA tests were performed in diabetic patients and nondiabetic controls. DA was measured using AdaptDx dark adaptometer and the rod intercept was recorded. Macular OCTA images were acquired using the RTVue XR Avanti with AngioVue. Eighty-six eyes from 57 patients with diabetes (19 with no DR, 19 with non-proliferative DR [NPDR], and 19 with proliferative DR [PDR] who had undergone photocoagulation) and 10 eyes from 10 patients without diabetes were recruited. A significant decrease in vascular density and a prolonged rod intercept were found as DR progressed (P<.01). A negative trend was found between vascular density and the rod intercept. The negative trend in the deep layer (R<sup>2</sup>=0.28) was more substantial than that in the superficial layer (R<sup>2</sup>=0.14). A prolonged rod intercept was associated with elevated HbA1c (R<sup>2</sup>=0.08). The vascular density of the macula could be assessed by OCTA and the functional change in the outer retina could be measured non-invasively by DA. The severity of decreasing vascular density and prolongation of DA are proportional to progression of DR. Decreased deep retinal vascular perfusion density and impaired DA response are correlated and show a negative trend according to the severity of DR. "
Morphometric analysis in mouse scleral fibroblasts using focused ion beam/scanning electron microscopy.,"Idiopathic full-thickness macular hole is a severe visual impairment disease. Pars plana vitrectomy remains the primary treatment option for idiopathic full-thickness macular holes, and over 90% idiopathic full-thickness macular holes are closed by vitrectomy surgery. However, the full-thickness macular hole may close spontaneously, with a good visual acuity progress. Since recent studies are small-sample studies and case reports, the characteristics for spontaneous closure of idiopathic full-thickness macular holes are not fully understood. Here, we review the articles in PubMed database from 1999 to 2018 and discuss the characteristic and the risk factors, especially OCT structure features, for spontaneous closure of idiopathic full-thickness macular holes.

Personalizing medical care for MS patients: Monitoring brainstem damage by infrared oculography.,"<b>Background:</b> Over the past few decades, there has been an increase in the number of open access (OA) journals in almost all disciplines. This increase in OA journals was accompanied an increase in funding to support such movements. Medical fields are among the highest funded fields, which further promoted its journals to move toward OA publishing. Here, we aim to compare OA and non-OA journals in terms of citation metrics and other indices. <b>Methods:</b> We collected data on the included journals from Scopus Source List on 1 <sup>st</sup> November 2018. We filtered the list for medical journals only. For each journal, we extracted data regarding citation metrics, scholarly output, and wither the journal is OA or non-OA. <b>Results:</b> On the 2017 Scopus list of journals, there was 5835 medical journals. Upon analyzing the difference between medical OA and non-OA journals, we found that OA journals had a significantly higher CiteScore (p< 0.001), percent cited (p< 0.001), and source normalized impact per paper (SNIP) (p< 0.001), whereas non-OA journals had higher scholarly output (p< 0.001). Among the five largest journal publishers, Springer Nature published the highest frequency of OA articles (31.5%), while Wiley-Blackwell had the lowest frequency among its medical journals (4.4%). <b>Conclusion:</b> Among medical journals, although non-OA journals still have higher output in terms of articles per year, OA journals have higher citation metrics.

Diagnosing and quantifying a common deficit in multiple sclerosis: Internuclear ophthalmoplegia.,"<b>Background:</b> The assessment of specific polysaccharide antibody production plays a pivotal role in the diagnosis of humoral primary immunodeficiencies (PID). The response to 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine (PPV) remains the gold standard for the diagnosis of polysaccharide antibodies. However, in Spain, the interpretation of pure polysaccharide 23-valent immunization is hampered by the high endemicity of pneumococcal disease and the generalization of the 13-valent adjuvant pneumococcal vaccination. Specific Typhim Vi vaccination (TV) immunoglobulin G IgG response to immunization is useful in adult PID, but there is no data regarding children. <b>Objectives:</b> To evaluate the clinical utility of TV IgG production as a diagnostic tool to determine anti-polysaccharide antibody production deficiency in children, when the response to PPV is unclear and isolated determination of serotypes is unfeasible. <b>Methods:</b> We conducted a single-institution prospective observational study on 61 children with recurrent infections. Baseline specific antibodies against PPV and TV were evaluated. In 28 children (46%), the response to the production of antibodies confirmed a clinical suspicion of humoral PID, and they were therefore immunized with 23-valent pneumococcal vaccine and Typhim Vi. Both specific antibody responses were measured by ELISA (The Binding Site Group Ltd, Birmingham, UK) using previously published cut-offs. <b>Results:</b> Seventy percent of the 61 children displayed baseline PPV IgG > 27 mg/L, whereas only 8% showed TV IgG > 28 U/mL (<i>p</i> < 0.0001). Twenty-one of 28 children (75%) achieved a 3-fold increase in post-vaccination TV IgG levels, whereas only 3% achieved a 4-fold increase in PPV IgG post vaccination, mainly due to high baseline PPV IgG titers. When we classified children according to their response to TV as responders or non-responders and compared this with the well-known clinical warning signs of the Jeffrey Modell Foundation. The proportions of children with history of pneumonia and the need for intravenous antibiotics were significantly higher in TV IgG non-responders than in TV IgG responders (<i>p</i> = 0.02 and <i>p</i> = 0.01, respectively). <b>Conclusion:</b> Response to TV can be considered an ancillary diagnostic tool to determine polysaccharide antibodies in children, particularly when isolated determination of pneumococcal serotypes is not feasible. TV provides a useful asset for clinicians in the era of conjugate PPV vaccination, with clinical relevance. Further research is warranted for validation. "
Bone mineral density in patients with longstanding type 1 diabetes: Results from the Canadian Study of Longevity in Type 1 Diabetes.,"<b>Background:</b> Anakinra (ANA) is an effective treatment choice in patients with adult onset Still's disease (AOSD). Variables affecting treatment survival include loss of efficacy or adverse events, but also the decision to discontinue treatment after long-term clinical remission. <b>Objectives:</b> Aims of this study were: (i) to assess the drug retention rate (DRR) of ANA during a long-term follow-up looking for any difference related to the line of biologic treatment, the concomitant use of conventional disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (cDMARDs) and the different type of AOSD (systemic versus chronic articular); (ii) to identify predictive factors of lack of efficacy, loss of efficacy, and ANA withdrawal owing to long-term remission. <b>Methods:</b> AOSD patients classified according with Yamaguchi criteria and treated with ANA were retrospectively enrolled in 18 Italian tertiary Centers. Demographic, laboratory, clinical and therapeutic data related to the start of ANA (<i>baseline</i>), the 3-month assessment and the last follow-up visit while on ANA treatment were retrospectively collected and statistically analyzed. <b>Results:</b> One hundred and forty-one AOSD patients (48 males, 93 females) treated with ANA for a mean period of 35.96  36.05 months were enrolled. The overall DRR of ANA was 44.6 and 30.5% at the 60- and 120-month assessments, respectively, with no significant differences between: (i) biologic nave patients and those previously treated with other biologics (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.97); (ii) monotherapy and concomitant use of cDMARDs (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.45); (iii) systemic and chronic articular types of AOSD (log-rank <i>p</i> = 0.67). No variables collected at <i>baseline</i> could predict primary inefficacy, while the number of swollen joints at baseline was significantly associated with secondary inefficacy (<i>p</i> = 0.01, OR = 1.194, C.I. 1.043-1.367). The typical AOSD skin rash was negatively related with ANA withdrawal owing to long-term remission (<i>p</i> = 0.03, OR = 0.224, C.I. 0.058-0.863). <b>Conclusion:</b> Long-term DRR of ANA has been found excellent and is not affected by different lines of biologic treatment, concomitant use of cDMARDs, or type of AOSD. The risk of losing ANA efficacy increases along with the number of swollen joints at the start of therapy, while the typical skin rash is a negative predictor of ANA withdrawal related to sustained remission.

Conversion Disorder Manifesting as Functional Visual Loss.,"How to precisely quantify the binocular eye balance (i.e., the contribution that each eye makes to the binocular percept) across a range of spatial frequencies using a binocular combination task, is an important issue in both clinical and basic research. In this study, we aimed to compare the precision of a binocular orientation combination paradigm with that of the standard binocular phase combination paradigm in measuring the binocular eye balance at low to high spatial frequencies. Nine normal adults (average age: 24.6  2.0 years old) participated. Subjects viewed an LED screen dichoptically with polarized glasses in a dark room. The method of constant stimuli was used to quantitatively assess the point of subjective equality (PSE), i.e., the interocular contrast ratio when two eyes are balanced in binocular combination, for stimulus spatial frequencies from 0.5 to 8 cycles/degree. Precision was quantified by the variance [i.e., standard error (SE), obtained from 100 bootstrap estimates] associated to the PSE. Using stimuli whose interocular phase difference at the edge of the gratings was matched at 45, we found that the orientation paradigm provides more precision than the standard binocular phase combination paradigm, especially at high frequencies (Experiment 1). Such differences remained when using stimuli that had three times larger interocular phase difference (Experiment 2) or displayed at four times higher stimuli resolution (Experiment 3). Our results indicate that a binocular combination tasked based on orientation rather than phase, provides a more precise estimate of binocular eye balance in human adults at high spatial frequencies, thus allowing a binocular balance to be assessed within the spatial region where amblyopes are most defective (i.e., high spatial frequencies). "
The impact of glistenings on the optical quality of a hydrophobic acrylic intraocular lens.,"Glaucoma is an optic neuropathy characterized by progressive degeneration of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Aberrations in several cytoskeletal proteins, such as tau have been implicated in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, could be initiating factors in glaucoma progression and occurring prior to axon degeneration. Developmentally regulated brain protein (Drebrin or DBN1) is an evolutionarily conserved actin-binding protein playing a prominent role in neurons and is implicated in neurodegenerative diseases. However, the relationship between circulating DBN1 levels and RGC degeneration in glaucoma patients remains unclear. In our preliminary study, we detected drebrin protein in the plasma of glaucoma patients using proteomic analysis. Subsequently, we recruited a total of 232 patients including primary angle-closure glaucoma (PACG), primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) and Posner-Schlossman syndrome (PS) and measured its DBN1 plasma levels. We observed elevated DBN1 plasma levels in patients with primary glaucoma but not in patients with PS compared to nonaxonopathic controls. Interestingly, in contrast to tau plasma levels increased in all groups of patients, elevated drebrin plasma levels correlated with retinal nerve fiber layer defect (RNFLD) in glaucoma patients. To further explore the expression of DBN1 in neurodegeneration, we conducted experiment of optic nerve crush (ONC) models, and observed increased expression of DBN1 in the serum as well as in the retina and then decreased after ONC. This result reinforces the potentiality of circulating DBN1 levels are increased in glaucoma patients with neurodegeneration. Taken together, our findings suggest that circulating DBN1 levels correlated with RNFLD and may reflect the severity of RGCs injury in glaucoma patients. Combining measurement of circulating drebrin and tau levels may be a useful indicator for monitoring progression of neurodegenerative diseases. "
A modified intraocular lens design to reduce negative dysphotopsia.,"Carotid artery ligation carries a potential risk of ischemic complications even in patients with good collaterals and adequate cross-circulation. Preoperative assessment through balloon test occlusion (BTO) is technically challenging and not feasible in all patients. We analyze our experience with universal bypass without performing detailed cerebrovascular reserve (CVR) studies in 23 patients before carotid artery ligation. This was a retrospective analysis of the case records of 23 patients who underwent cervical carotid artery ligation for various indications since January 2009. The study included 21 patients with cavernous carotid aneurysms, one patient with a large fusiform petrous carotid aneurysm, and one patient with recurrent glomus jugulare encasing the cervical internal carotid artery. The initial 12 patients underwent preoperative BTO with hypotensive challenge. All patients underwent a bypass procedure followed by carotid artery ligation irrespective of the BTO findings. Patients who successfully completed a BTO underwent a low-flow superficial temporal artery to middle cerebral artery bypass. A high-flow extracranial-intracranial bypass using a saphenous vein graft from external carotid artery to middle cerebral artery was done in all patients who either failed the BTO or did not undergo BTO. We had two operative mortalities and one poor outcome. All the other patients had a good recovery with a Glasgow outcome score of 5 at the last follow-up. Graft patency rates were 81.1% in both the low-flow and high-flow groups. Universal high-flow bypass is safe, effective, and should be preferred in all patients before carotid artery ligation. It obviates the need for detailed CVR assessment, especially in centers with limited resources. "
CD30 Aptamer-functionalized PEG-PLGA nanoparticles for the superior delivery of doxorubicin to anaplastic large cell lymphoma cells.,"To evaluate the long-term progression of idiopathic epiretinal membranes (iERMs) with good baseline visual acuity, and to identify predictors of visual decline. Retrospective case series SUBJECTS METHODS: We reviewed records of 145 eyes with iERM and best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 20/40 or greater at presentation, including BCVA, lens status, and central macular thickness (CMT) at yearly visits; as well as anatomic biomarkers including vitreomacular adhesion, pseudohole, lamellar hole, intraretinal cysts, disorganization of the inner retinal layers (DRIL), and disruption of outer retinal layers. Linear mixed effects and mixed-effects Cox proportional hazards models were used to identify clinical and anatomic predictors of vision change and time to surgery. At presentation, mean BCVA was 0.170.10 logMAR units (Snellen 20/30) and mean CMT was 353.375.4m. After a median follow-up of 3.7 years (range 1-7 years), BCVA declined slowly at 0.0120.003 logMAR units/year, with phakic eyes declining more rapidly than pseudophakic eyes (0.0190.003 vs. 0.0100.004 logMAR units/year). Metamorphopsia, phakic lens status, lamellar hole, and inner nuclear layer cysts were associated with faster visual decline. Cumulative rates of progression to surgery were 2.9, 5.6, 12.2, and 21.1% at years 1-4. Visual symptoms, metamorphopsia, greater CMT, and disruption of outer retinal layers were associated with greater hazard for surgery. Eyes with iERM and visual acuity20/40 experience slow visual decline, with 21% of eyes requiring surgery after 4 years. Clinical and anatomic predictors of vision loss may be distinct from factors associated with earlier surgical intervention. "
Patient Satisfaction with Oral Versus Intravenous Sedation for Cataract Surgery : A Randomized Clinical Trial.,"Primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide and mutations in known genes can only explain 5-6% of POAG. This study was conducted to identify novel POAG-causing genes and explore the pathogenesis of this disease. Exome sequencing was performed in a Han Chinese cohort comprising 398 sporadic cases with POAG and 2010 controls, followed by replication studies by Sanger sequencing. A heterozygous Ramp2 knockout mouse model was generated for in vivo functional study. Using exome sequencing analysis and replication studies, we identified pathogenic variants in receptor activity-modifying protein 2 (RAMP2) within three genetically diverse populations (Han Chinese, German, and Indian). Six heterozygous RAMP2 pathogenic variants (Glu39Asp, Glu54Lys, Phe103Ser, Asn113Lysfs*10, Glu143Lys, and Ser171Arg) were identified among 16 of 4763 POAG patients, whereas no variants were detected in any exon of RAMP2 in 10,953 control individuals. Mutant RAMP2s aggregated in transfected cells and resulted in damage to the AM-RAMP2/CRLR-cAMP signaling pathway. Ablation of one Ramp2 allele led to cAMP reduction and retinal ganglion cell death in mice. This study demonstrated that disruption of RAMP2/CRLR-cAMP axis could cause POAG and identified a potential therapeutic intervention for POAG. "
Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in an animal model of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization.,"CRISPR-Cas genome editing induces targeted DNA damage but can also affect off-target sites. Current off-target discovery methods work using purified DNA or specific cellular models but are incapable of direct detection in vivo. We developed DISCOVER-Seq (discovery of in situ Cas off-targets and verification by sequencing), a universally applicable approach for unbiased off-target identification that leverages the recruitment of DNA repair factors in cells and organisms. Tracking the precise recruitment of MRE11 uncovers the molecular nature of Cas activity in cells with single-base resolution. DISCOVER-Seq works with multiple guide RNA formats and types of Cas enzymes, allowing characterization of new editing tools. Off-targets can be identified in cell lines and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells and during adenoviral editing of mice, paving the way for in situ off-target discovery within individual patient genotypes during therapeutic genome editing.

The circadian clock gene <i>Bmal1</i> is required to control the timing of retinal neurogenesis and lamination of Mller glia in the mouse retina.,"Neuronal populations in sensory cortex produce variable responses to sensory stimuli and exhibit intricate spontaneous activity even without external sensory input. Cortical variability and spontaneous activity have been variously proposed to represent random noise, recall of prior experience, or encoding of ongoing behavioral and cognitive variables. Recording more than 10,000 neurons in mouse visual cortex, we observed that spontaneous activity reliably encoded a high-dimensional latent state, which was partially related to the mouse's ongoing behavior and was represented not just in visual cortex but also across the forebrain. Sensory inputs did not interrupt this ongoing signal but added onto it a representation of external stimuli in orthogonal dimensions. Thus, visual cortical population activity, despite its apparently noisy structure, reliably encodes an orthogonal fusion of sensory and multidimensional behavioral information. "
Regulation of Matrix Metalloproteinase 2 and 9 in Corneal Neovascularization.,"The objective of the study was to assess a new technology, the tear film imager (TFI), which can dynamically image the muco-aqueous and lipid layers. Prospective pilot case series of individuals with and without dry eye (DE). Two sequential images were obtained with the TFI. Measurements were assessed for reproducibility and compared with clinically derived DE metrics. Individuals were grouped into DE categories based on signs of DE. 49 patients participated in the study with a mean age of 58.8 years (SD 15.9) and a female majority (69%). Reproducibility of the muco-aqueous layer thickness (MALT) was excellent (r=0.88). MALT measurements significantly correlated with the Schirmer score (r=0.31). Lipid break up time (LBUT) as measured by the TFI significantly correlated with the clinical measure of tear break up time (TBUT) (r=0.73). MALT and LBUT were significantly thinner and shorter, respectively, in the DE groups (mild-moderate and severe) compared with the control group. When comparing TFI parameters to clinically assessed signs, sensitivity of the device was 87% and specificity was 88%. The TFI is the first machine capable of reproducibly measuring muco-aqueous thickness in human subjects which correlates with Schirmer score. In parallel, it assesses other important aspects of tear film function which correlate with clinician assessed DE metrics. "
"Effect of Topical 1% Cyclopentolate Hydrochloride on Tear Production, Intraocular Pressure, and Pupil Size in Healthy Turkman Horses.","To study the relationship between epithelial thickness (ET) and corneal thickness (CT) in healthy fellow eyes of patients with unilateral bullous keratopathy (BKP) and healthy subjects. Seventeen BKP patients (nine males, eight females, 73.210.4 years) and 40 healthy individuals (20 males, 20 females, 69.59.8 years) were included. All participants received anterior segment optical coherence tomography and specular microscopy with calculation of endothelial cell density. ET, CT, stromal thickness and ET-to-CT ratio were defined automatically (within 2mm central area). Central epithelial thickness (CET) and central corneal thickness (CCT) were measured manually at the corneal centre and stromal thickness and CET-to-CCT ratio were calculated. In healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients compared with eyes of healthy individuals ET was statistically significantly lower (p<0.001) while CT was statistically significantly higher (by 28.9 and 30.9m in 2mm zone and corneal centre, respectively). Both 2mm ET-to-CT ratio (0.0910.01and 0.100.004, respectively [p<0.001]) and CET-to-CCT ratio (0.0830.006and 0.970.005, respectively [p<0.0001]) were statistically significantly lower in healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients compared with eyes of healthy individuals. To identify healthy fellow eyes of BKP patients, area under curve for CET-to-CCT ratio and CET was 0.94 and 0.80, respectively (p=0.01), and for 2mm ET-to-CT ratio and 2mm ET was 0.91 and 0.80, respectively (p=0.03). Decreased ET-to-CT ratio resulting from simultaneous epithelial thinning and stromal thickening without significant corneal thickening indicates subclinical dysfunction of corneal endothelium in healthy fellow eyes in unilateral BKP patients.

Healthcare Utilization and Treatment Patterns in Diabetic Macular Edema in Korea: a Retrospective Chart Review.,"To determine the association between dementia and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) using meta-analysis. We searched in the MEDLINE, EMBASE, Web of Knowledge, PsycInfo and Cochrane database of systematic reviews for studies published from March 1959 to March 2018. We included cross-sectional, case-control and cohort studies that evaluated the association of dementia/Alzheimer's disease (AD) with AMD (as outcome) and the association of AMD with dementia/AD (as outcome). Studies that compared cognitive functions between AMD and controls were also included. The summary outcomes, namely odds ratio (OR), relative risk, mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs, were estimated using random effects models. We performed sensitivity analysis based on study quality and individual study effect to control for potential biases. Among 2159 citation records, we identified 21 studies consisting of 7 876 499 study subjects for meta-analysis. Patients with dementia (p<sub>adjusted</sub>0.017, OR1.24, I<sup>2</sup>9%) or AD (p=0.001, OR<sub>unadjusted</sub>=2.22, I<sup>2</sup>=50%) were at risk for AMD, particularly for late AMD (p<sub>adjusted</sub><0.001, OR=1.37, I<sup>2</sup>=0). AMD was also significantly associated with increased risk of AD/cognitive impairment (p<sub>adjusted</sub>=0.037, OR=2.42, I<sup>2</sup>=38%). Moreover, patients with AMD had poorer cognitive functions when compared with controls, including Mini-Mental State Examination (p<0.001, I<sup>2</sup>79%) and Trail Making Test A (p<0.001, I<sup>2</sup>=0). Sensitivity analysis and Egger's test indicated our results were less likely biased. A significant association between dementia/AD and AMD calls for greater clinical awareness. The cost-effectiveness of routine screening for the other condition in patients with primary diagnosis of dementia/AD or AMD requires further study. "
Asymmetric bilateral retinitis in patient with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis.,"To investigate the anatomical changes and the macular function in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD) eyes, according to the recognition of either fibrocellular or fibrovascular phenotype. We enrolled eyes with previously treated neovascular AMD in remission (no subretinal haemorrhage, sign of fluid in or under the retina and no treatment for at least 6 months). Subjects underwent multimodal imaging assessment and were tested for macular sensitivity using microperimetry. The study cohort was divided according to the presence of fibrosis on multicolour (MC) images, yielding two distinct phenotypic subgroups: (1) fibrocellular group and (2) fibrovascular group. Nineteen eyes were classified as fibrocellular on MC images, while 22 eyes as fibrovascular. MeanSDage was 73.911.0 years in the fibrocellular group and 75.97.1 years in the fibrovascular group (p=0.221). Best-corrected visual acuity was 0.70.5 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (LogMAR) in the fibrocellular group and 0.30.2 LogMAR in the fibrovascular group (p=0.003). On the optical coherence tomography and fundus autofluorescence evaluation, 17/19 eyes with the fibrocellular phenotype and 8/22 eyes with the fibrovascular phenotype displayed the presence of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy (p=0.001). The perfusion density within the neovascular lesion was 28.9%9.9% in the fibrocellular group and 44.2%5.9 % in the fibrovascular group (p<0.0001). Neovascular AMD eyes in remission and with evidence of fibrocellular scar are characterised by RPE atrophy and reduced perfusion, which are associated with a higher degree of functional impairment. These findings suggest that maturation of vessels in fibrosis might be a better target in neovascular AMD treatments rather than their abolishment. "
The effect of geodemographic factors on the attendance rates at a regional diabetic retinopathy treatment centre.,"To investigate whether the combined subconjunctival injection of dexamethasone can accelerate the decrease in intraocular pressure (IOP) in acute primary angle closure (APAC)-affected eyes. 42 patients with APAC were recruited for a randomised controlled trial. These patients were separated into two groups: the injection group (21 patients) and the control group (21 patients). The injection group was subjected to a subconjunctival injection with 2.5mg dexamethasone. Other drug treatments were the same with the control group. The follow-up was at 0, 3, 6, 12 and 24hours after injection. The outcome measures include IOP and intraocular inflammation variables. The IOP was significantly decreased in both groups after treatment. However, 24hours after the initial treatment, the IOP of the injection group was significantly lower compared with the control group (p = 0.017). Kaplan-Meier survival curve analysis showed that the total success rate of the injection group and the control group were 79.7% and 54.9% at 24hours after treatment (p = 0.027), respectively. For the comparison of anterior chamber inflammation, the severity of conjunctival erythema, ciliary flush and pain in the injection group was also lower than that in the control group at 24hours after treatment(p = 0.012, p = 0.048 and p = 0.013, respectively). No statistical significance was found between the two groups regarding the anterior chamber cells, anterior chamber flare and photophobia. The combined subconjunctival injection of dexamethasone for the management of APAC eyes can significantly accelerate the relief of high IOP, and therefore, improve the success rate of treatment. "
Cholesterol 24-Hydroxylation by CYP46A1: Benefits of Modulation for Brain Diseases.,"In a previous genome-wide association study of Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis (SJS/TEN) patients we reported the association between SJS/TEN and the prostaglandin E receptor 3 (PTGER3) gene, and that its protein PGE<sub>2</sub> receptor 3 (EP3) was markedly downregulated in the conjunctival epithelium of SJS/TEN patients. Here we examined EP3 expression of the eyelid epidermis in SJS/TEN patients with severe ocular complications and investigated the function of EP3. For the immunohistochemical study, we obtained eyelid samples from five SJS/TEN patients and five patients without SJS/TEN (control subjects) who were undergoing surgery to treat trichiasis, and investigated the expression of EP3 protein in the epidermis of those samples. To investigate the EP3 function in the human epidermal keratinocytes, we performed ELISA and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, since it is reported that PGE<sub>2</sub> suppresses cytokine production via EP3 in human conjunctival epithelium. The results of the immunohistochemical study revealed that EP3 expression in the eyelid epidermis of the SJS/TEN patients was the same as that in the controls. PGE<sub>2</sub> and a selective EP3 agonist suppressed cytokine production and expression induced by polyinosine-polycytidylic acid stimulation, such as chemokine ligand 5 and chemokine motif ligand 10. Our findings revealed that in chronic-phase SJS/TEN, EP3 protein was expressed in the eyelid epidermis and was not downregulated, unlike in conjunctival epithelium, and that PGE<sub>2</sub> could suppress cytokine production via EP3 in human epidermal keratinocytes. Thus, EP3 expression in the epidermis might contribute to a silencing of skin inflammation in chronic-phase SJS/TEN. "
Characterization of deeply embedded corneal foreign bodies with anterior segment optical coherence tomography.,"To evaluate the efficacy of an intravitreal dexamethasone (IVD) implant (Ozurdex) for the treatment of central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) without macular edema (ME). A retrospective cohort study was designed, and 20 eyes of 20 patients diagnosed with non-ischemic CRVO without ME were included. A total of 10 CRVO eyes were observed without treatment, and another 10 CRVO eyes received a single IVD injection at baseline. Mean changes in pathomorphologic parameters of fundus and optical coherence tomography parameters were measured at baseline and at 1, 3, 6, and 12months. The decreases in venous tortuosity (p=0.014 for superior; 0.036 for inferior arcades) and width (p=0.024 for superior; 0.003 for inferior arcades) from baseline to 12months after injection were significantly greater in the treated group than the observed group. The improvements in RNFL swelling (p=0.010) and retinal hemorrhage (p=0.006) were also significantly greater in the treated group. Visual symptom improvement was significantly faster in the treated group (p=0.001). In two cases, IVD injection resulted in complete resolution of cilioretinal artery occlusion associated with the CRVO, leading to complete visual recovery in 1 week. None of the treated eyes showed signs of ME development, ischemia progression, or neovascularization. IVD implant was significantly effective in improving venous engorgement, retinal hemorrhage, RNFL swelling, and visual symptoms by presumed alleviation of disc swelling and venous outflow. This treatment may be a considerable treatment option in CRVO patients with no ME. "
Correlation of retinal vascular perfusion density with dark adaptation in diabetic retinopathy.,"To assess macular ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness in patients treated with intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) for exudative age related macular degeneration (AMD). This was a two-year retrospective institutional case series where records of patients treated with anti-VEGF injections for unilateral AMD were reviewed for BCVA, intraocular pressure, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Macular GCL thickness was evaluated with automated retinal segmentation based on ETDRS grid rings. Retinal layer segmentation was carefully assessed and manually corrected for any misalignment. 48 eyes of 24 patients with unilateral exudative AMD were included. The mean number of anti-VEGF injections was 10.4  3.2. Fellow eyes were classified as AREDS category one and two. There was significant thinning of the 3-mm macular GCL in treated compared with fellow eyes at one and two years (P= 0.03 and P= 0.04, respectively). GCL thickness compared to baseline showed a significant decrease at one and two years in treated (P= 0.01 and <0.0001) and at two years in untreated fellow eyes (P= 0.02). There is a decrease of macular GCL thickness in eyes with exudative AMD treated with anti-VEGF intravitreal injections in comparison with fellow eyes. There is longitudinal thinning of the GCL from baseline in eyes with both treated exudative and non-treated early AMD. "
Characteristics and Risk Factors for Spontaneous Closure of Idiopathic Full-Thickness Macular Hole.,"Glaucoma affects more than 70 million people worldwide, with about 10% being bilaterally blind, making it the leading cause of irreversible blindness globally. In patients with advanced glaucoma or those who have failed medical treatment without achieving adequate intraocular pressure (IOP) control, trabeculectomy (glaucoma filtration surgery where an ostium is created into the anterior chamber from underneath a partial thickness scleral flap to allow for aqueous flow out of the anterior chamber intointo the subconjunctival space forming a filtering bleb) and aqueous shunt surgery for more complex and refractory cases remain the mainstay therapies. Proliferation of fibrous tissue around an implanted aqueous shunt may block the diffusion of aqueous humour. Mitomycin C (MMC) is one of two commonly used adjunct antifibrotic agents used during aqueous shunt surgery to prevent proliferation of fibrous tissue. However, the effectiveness and safety of the use of intraoperative MMC during aqueous shunt surgery has not been established. To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of MMC versus no MMC used during aqueous shunt surgery for reducing IOP in primary and secondary glaucoma. We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2018, Issue 2); Ovid MEDLINE; Embase.com; PubMed; Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature Database (LILACS); ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 13 February 2018. We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which one group of participants received MMC during aqueous shunt surgery and another group did not. We did not exclude studies based on outcomes. Two review authors independently reviewed titles and abstracts from the literature searches. We obtained full-text reports of potentially relevant studies and assessed them for inclusion. Two review authors independently extracted data related to study characteristics, risk of bias, and outcomes. We used standard methodological procedures expected by Cochrane. We included five RCTs, with a total of 333 eyes with glaucoma randomized, and identified two ongoing trials. All included trials examined the effect of MMC versus no MMC when used during aqueous shunt surgery for glaucoma. The trials included participants with different types of uncontrolled glaucoma. One study was conducted in China, one in Saudi Arabia, two in the USA, and one study was a multicenter study conducted in Brazil, Canada, Scotland, and USA. We assessed all trials as having overall unclear risk of bias due to incomplete reporting of study methods and outcomes; two of the five trials were reported only as conference abstracts.None of the included trials reported mean decrease from baseline in IOP; however, all five trials reported mean IOP at 12 months post-surgery. At 12 months, the effect of MMC on mean IOP compared with no MMC was unclear based on a meta-analysis of trials (mean difference -0.12 mmHg, 95% CI -2.16 to 2.41; low-certainty evidence). Two trial did not report sufficient information to include in meta-analysis, but reported that mean IOP was lower in the MMC group compared with the no MMC group at 12 months.None of the included trials reported mean change from baseline in visual acuity; however, one trial reported lower mean LogMAR values (better vision) in the MMC group than in the no MMC group at 12 months post-surgery. None of the included studies reported the proportion of participants with stable best-corrected visual acuity. Three trials reported that loss of vision was not significantly different between groups (no data available for meta-analysis).None of the included studies reported the proportion of participants with a postoperative hypertensive phase, which is defined as IOP > 21 mmHg within 3 months after surgery. Two trials reported adverse events (choroidal effusion, corneal edema, flat anterior chamber, and retinal detachment); however, due to small numbers of events and sample sizes, no clear difference between MMC and placebo groups was observed. We found insufficient evidence in this review to suggest MMC provides any postoperative benefit for glaucoma patients who undergo aqueous shunt surgery. Data across all five included trials were sparse and the reporting of study methods required to assess bias was inadequate. Future RCTs of this intervention should report methods in sufficient detail to permit assessment of potential bias and estimate target sample sizes based on clinically meaningful effect sizes. "
The impact of the open-access status on journal indices: a review of medical journals.,"The evaluation of pupillary function is a keystone in the neuro-ophthalmic assessment of patients. The diagnosis of an afferent or efferent pupillary disorder is crucial in the acquisition of a broad range of diseases of the brain or the peripheral nervous system. This ""update"" of pupillary disorders covers a major part of clinical conditions eye doctors have to expect in their daily practice. The significance of pupillary evaluation, however, extends far beyond the area of ophthalmology. "
Measurement of Typhim Vi IgG as a Diagnostic Tool to Determine Anti-polysaccharide Antibody Production Deficiency in Children.,Botulinum toxin has been first applied in ophthalmology (as treatment for strabismus) and is nowadays widely used in many clinical areas. Currently the main application in ophthalmology is the treatment of essential blepharospasm and hemifacial spasm. Other important indications for botulinum toxin in ophthalmology are eyelid retraction in Graves' disease and the induction of protective ptosis in lagophthalmos or corneal diseases. 
Long-Term Retention Rate of Anakinra in Adult Onset Still's Disease and Predictive Factors for Treatment Response.,"Optic neuritis (ON) is a frequent manifestation of demyelinating attack in multiple sclerosis (MS). Initial visual loss can vary from minimal to complete. Visual improvement occurs in about 95% of patients, some of them recovering to normal [visual acuity (VA), color vision, visual field (VF)]. We analyzed retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL) thickness in MS patients who recovered their normal vision after ON to determine whether a relative preservation of RGCL existed in these patients. We conducted a retrospective study of all patients with MS and ON examined by one of us (F.X.B.) between 2013 and 2018. Inclusion criteria were strictly unilateral ON, full recovery of vision, computerized visual field, and OCT examinations. Full recovery of vision was defined as VA 10/10, Ishihara 11/13, and VF mean defect (MD) 2.6dB. Evaluation of RGCL was obtained with spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The normal fellow eye of all patients served as the control group. Relative thinning of RGCL, expressed as percentage, was calculated by comparing results from the affected eye to the fellow eye of the same patient. Twenty-one patients (21 affected eyes - Group 1, 21 normal fellow eyes - Group 2) satisfying the inclusion criteria were retrieved from our database. All patients exhibited the relapsing-remitting form of MS. There were 16 women and 5men. Mean age was 39.3 years old. There were no statistically significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 for either VA (p=0.3934) or Ishihara (p=0.140), but a significant difference was found for VF MD (p=0.0405). A markedly significant difference for RGCL thickness (p=0.0001) was found, without any correlation with the degree of visual recovery. A subgroup of patients (n=14) was examined at the time of initial visual loss. We correlated their results of visual function to the final RGCL thickness, and a correlation was found between either the initial VA loss or the initial VF loss and the final loss of RGCL (R2=0.4075 and R2=0.00739, respectively). In our study, all patients with ON lost a significant amount of RGCL despite a full recovery of vision, as defined by our criteria. The percentage of RGCL loss varied from 5-27% and could not be correlated with any final visual indices. However, a correlation was found with the degree of initial visual loss. Despite sometimes marked RGCL loss after ON, patients with MS can recover normal visual function, according to standard clinical tests. "
The Binocular Balance at High Spatial Frequencies as Revealed by the Binocular Orientation Combination Task.,"Ocular chemical burn is an ophthalmological emergency. Therefore, chemical injuries should be promptly addressed in order to initiate the appropriate treatment as soon as possible and optimize the visual prognosis. We present a retrospective study of ten cases with ocular chemical burn including one with superglue and one with a liquid plaster material injury and describe their clinical course. Ten adult patients (34-92 years, 8 males) presented with moderate to severe alkali or neutral chemical burns in our emergency clinics. They exhibited a variable degree of conjunctival injection, limbal ischemia, corneal erosion, and Descemet's folds. Patients were treated and complete corneal epithelial closure was achieved in all cases without significant signs of limbal stem cell insufficiency. Corneal endothelial insufficiency was observed in all cases. Nine patients had to be listed for corneal endothelial keratoplasty and one was treated with Descemet's stripping endothelial automated keratoplasty. Isolated corneal endothelial decompensation after chemical burns has not yet been described. The pathophysiological explanation of this observation remains, however, unknown. In view of this rare complication, it is important to follow patients after chemical ocular burn for possible development of endothelial decompensation. "
Elevated Plasma Levels of Drebrin in Glaucoma Patients With Neurodegeneration.,"To identify the image modality allowing identification of choroidal neovascularisation (CNV) complicating chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CSCR), including fluorescein angiography (FA), indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Patients diagnosed with chronic CSCR and secondary CNV were included in the study. The image modalities FA, ICGA, and OCT-A were reviewed for specific CNV signs permitting diagnosis. Patients with missing image modalities, poor image quality, previous laser treatment, or other confounding pathologies were excluded. CNV was identified on OCT-A in 32 of 33 eyes (97%), whereas ICGA revealed an abnormal vascular network in 23 eyes (70%), significantly less frequently than with OCT-A (p=0.003). FA allowed CNV identification in 10 eyes (30%), significantly less frequently than with OCT-A (p<0.001). Type 1 CNV was detected by OCT-A in 29 of 30 eyes (97%), by ICGA in 20 eyes (67%; p=0.0027), and by FA in 8 eyes (27%; p<0.001). OCTA is a useful diagnostic tool to detect occult CNV complicating chronic CSCR. This image modality might be important for adequate patient care. "
Does Universal Bypass before Carotid Artery Occlusion Obviate the Need for Balloon Test Occlusion: Personal Experience with Extracranial-Intracranial Bypass in 23 Patients.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a microvascular disease characterized by capillary dropout and resultant retinal ischemia which then leads to retinal vascular remodeling. Our goal was to assess blood flow velocities in retinal collateral vessels in healthy and diabetic subjects with various stages of DR. In our pilot study, we enrolled five eyes of five healthy subjects (H), five eyes of four subjects with diabetes and no retinopathy (DM), three eyes of three subjects with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (MDR), and five eyes of four subjects with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). Following routine ophthalmic examination, all subjects were imaged using a retinal function imager (RFI; Optical Imaging Inc., Rehovot, Israel). The built-in software of the RFI was used to identify and segment retinal collaterals with measurement of the blood flow velocities (BFV). One-way ANOVA was performed for BFV, followed by Newman-Keuls post hoc test. The level of significance was set at 5%. The total number of collateral segments involved in the study was 30, 31, 21, and 39 in the H, DM, MDR, and PDR groups, respectively. The BFVs in the collaterals were significantly lower in PDR (H: 1.860.67, DM: 1.910.71, MDR: 1.710.53, PDR: 1.370.58mm/s). The PDR group showed a statistically significant difference in the comparisons to all groups (p=0.012, p=0.008, and p=0.043 for the H, DM, and MDR groups, respectively), while no other comparisons between the groups were significant. We observed decreased BFV in retinal collaterals in PDR that may be due to the extensive capillary dropout and retinal ischemia. Further studies are needed for the noninvasive functional assessment of retinal microvascular changes in DR to better understand the underlying pathophysiology. "
Long-term natural history of idiopathic epiretinal membranes with good visual acuity.,"Patients operated in childhood for early esotropia may suffer from persistent strabismus, whether residual, recurrent, or consecutive, usually with a more complex oculomotor imbalance than in primitive strabismus. The clinical data are fundamental, in particular, (1) the basic accommodation-free deviation, (2) the horizontal far/near incomitance, (3) the cyclovertical incomitances and/or A or V pattern, and (4) the motility restrictions. In complicated cases, magnetic resonance tomography of the orbits showed the anomalies of the eye and muscle position. The intraoperative findings have to be taken into account, such as (1) the position of the eyes and (2) the muscle extensibility in antagonistic muscle pairs. Twenty-seven patients, aged 16 to 62, were included in the present retrospective study. All of them had repeat surgery between 2013 to 2018, 15 for residual esotropia and 12 for consecutive exotropia. In five of the eight patients with posterior fixation sutures on the medial recti, the residual exo or estropia was moderate and could be corrected with a recession or tuck of the lateral recti. In the three other patients with pronounced esotropia, revision of the posterior fixation sutures was carried out. In 19 patients (11 esotropia and 8 exotropia) with only prior conventional surgery, the surgical choice for the residual deviation went electively to the muscles that were most responsible for the motor imbalance, without using posterior fixation sutures. In 4 of these 19 patients, the deviation was small due, in particular, to residual incomitances. For any persistent cyclovertical incomitance, the overacting oblique muscles were recessed, and, in four patients with an A or V pattern, the lateral rectus insertions shifted to the horizontal meridian in the same procedure. The two main difficulties are to assess (1) the imbalance of the active and passive muscle force and (2) the surgically induced incomitances. "
Mutant RAMP2 causes primary open-angle glaucoma via the CRLR-cAMP axis.,"It was the aim of this study to analyse the refractive outcome of toric intraocular lens (t-IOL) implantation guided by a newly developed method of photographic alignment. Fourteen eyes of 10 patients (6 females, 4 males, age 63.46.7 (40.6-68.0) years [mean1SD (range)]) were included in this retrospective study. All eyes received an Oculentis Tplus LS-313 (Oculentis, Berlin, Germany) t-IOL after standard phacoemusification (n=4) or femtocataract laser-assisted surgery (n=10). Image-guided t-IOL alignment included: (1) calculation of t-IOL parameters (combination of different biometric methods) and plotting a layout drawing of the target lens position, (2) capture of an anterior segment slit lamp photograph in the upright position, (3) superposition of the photographs by the t-IOL target plot and a gradual scale, (4) drawing of marker lines on the photograph and removal of the IOL target coordinates, (5) transfer of the final image to a tablet PC, and (6) marking of the target axis at the corneal limbus with an ink pen in the surgical room. Preoperative corneal astigmatism was 2.500.97 (1.38-4.34) diopters (D) (mean1SD, range). In all eyes, intraoperative alignment could easily be performed using the photographic target layout. Surgical interventions and postoperative follow-up were without complications in all cases. Residual postoperative astigmatism was 0.160.24 (0.00-0.75) D (p<0.001 compared to preoperative astigmatism). In 64% of patients, residual subjective astigmatism was zero, in 93% 0.5 D, and in 100% 0.75 D. Postoperative uncorrected logMAR visual acuity (0.050.07, range 0.00-0.20) and best-corrected visual acuity (0.030.05, 0.00-0.10) were significantly better (each p<0.001) than best-corrected preoperative visual acuity (0.210.14, 0.00-0.49). Results of this clinical series clearly indicate that the newly developed photographically guided technique of toric lens alignment leads to highly accurate postoperative results for astigmatic correction.

Unbiased detection of CRISPR off-targets in vivo using DISCOVER-Seq.,"Convergence insufficiency is a very common disorder that can have significant adverse effects on school performance. When reading, children with this disorder often experience diplopia and headaches. We have recently obtained a rhesus monkey with a naturally occurring impairment of vergence eye movements. In the companion paper, we report behavioral testing that shows a pattern of impairments similar to what clinicians observe in human children with convergence insufficiency, including a receded near point, an exophoria that increases as target distance decreases, and difficulty maintaining an appropriate vergence angle when presented with a large field stimulus at near. For the present case report, we wondered whether these behavioral deficits would be associated with abnormal discharge patterns in brainstem neurons related to vergence eye movements. Single unit activity was recorded from near and far response cells in the supraoculomotor area in the vergence-impaired monkey, while he performed a smooth vergence tracking task or fixated visual targets at different distances. We found an abnormally weak sensitivity to both vergence angle and vergence velocity. Nonetheless, these neurons modulated in association with contextually inappropriate slow vergence movements that occurred in the absence of saccades but not for slow divergence drifts that immediately followed converging saccades. Modulation of activity was more robust when additional depth cues were available. These data suggest that disorders affecting vergence eye movements may be associated with impoverished sensory input to the near and far response cells and, perhaps, aberrant tuning in vergence-related neurons. "
"Spontaneous behaviors drive multidimensional, brainwide activity.","Human children with disorders affecting vergence eye movements have difficulty during close work, such as reading. Patients with convergence insufficiency show a receded near point and an exophoria that is greater at near than at far. Neurologic abnormalities may underlie these symptoms, but it is difficult to test this idea directly because there is no animal model for this disorder. In the present case report, we describe behavioral testing in a rhesus monkey with a naturally occurring impairment of vergence eye movements (monkey CI). Three monkeys were trained to perform a variety of oculomotor tasks that required saccades, vergence, and/or smooth tracking of a visual target moving in depth. Two of the monkeys (N1 and N2) were able to perform these tasks correctly. The third, monkey CI, was able to correctly perform these tasks when the required vergence angle was 5 but had difficulty when the task required larger convergence. This animal showed a consistent exodeviation that worsened as the target drew closer. When a variable prism was used to test disparity vergence in monkey CI, the animal showed an unstable convergence response (maximum 6) that increased with prism correction, up to 12 prism diopters. By comparison, monkey N1 was able to achieve stable, appropriate convergence up to 26 prism diopters. Monkey CI's performance on vergence tasks improved when a large-field random checkerboard pattern was used to provide additional depth cues. Monkey CI appears to have a naturally occurring disorder of vergence eye movements. "
Dynamic assessment of the tear film muco-aqueous and lipid layers using a novel tear film imager (TFI).,"Retinal oximetry imaging of retinal blood vessels measures oxygen saturation of hemoglobin. The imaging technology is non-invasive and reproducible with remarkably low variability on test-retest studies and in healthy cohorts. Pathophysiological principles and novel biomarkers in several retinal diseases have been discovered, as well as possible applications for systemic and brain disease. In diabetic retinopathy, retinal venous oxygen saturation is elevated and arteriovenous difference progressively reduced in advanced stages of retinopathy compared with healthy persons. This correlates with pathophysiology of diabetic retinopathy where hypoxia stimulates VEGF production. Laser treatment and vitrectomy both improve retinal oximetry values, which correlate with clinical outcome. The oximetry biomarker may allow automatic measurement of severity of diabetic retinopathy and predict its response to treatment. Central retinal vein occlusion is characterized by retinal hypoxia, which is evident in retinal oximetry. The retinal hypoxia seen on oximetry correlates with the extent of peripheral ischemia, visual acuity and thickness of macular edema. This biomarker may help diagnose and measure severity of vein occlusion and degree of retinal ischemia. Glaucomatous retinal atrophy is associated with reduced oxygen consumption resulting in reduced arteriovenous difference and higher retinal venous saturation. The oximetry findings correlate with worse visual field, thinner nerve fiber layer and smaller optic disc rim. This provides an objective biomarker for glaucomatous damage. In retinitis pigmentosa, an association exists between advanced atrophy, worse visual field and higher retinal venous oxygen saturation, lower arteriovenous difference. This biomarker may allow measurement of severity and progression of retinitis pigmentosa and other atrophic retinal diseases. Retinal oximetry offers visible light imaging of systemic and central nervous system vessels. It senses hypoxia in cardiac and pulmonary diseases. Oximetry biomarkers have been discovered in Alzheimer's disease and multiple sclerosis and oxygen levels in the retina correspond well with brain. "
Decreased epithelial to corneal thickness ratio in healthy fellow eyes of patients with unilateral bullous keratopathy.,"Conjunctivochalasis (CCH) is a common ocular disease, especially in aged people. However, the molecular mechanism of CCH on transcriptional level has been unclear. In this study, we characterized the transcriptional landscape of human conjunctiva and compared the transcriptome between normal persons (n=10) and CCH patients (n=11). Illumina RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) was performed to obtain transcriptional data, and these data were analyzed using various bioinformatics methods, including read mapping, the analysis of gene expression, gene ontology (GO) analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Gene and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway analysis. Additionally, expression patterns of 20 dysregupated genes were validated by qRT-PCR. RNA-seq result showed that clean ratios of 21 samples were more than 95% and more than 92% of all clean reads (32-41 million reads) were mapped to human genome sequence. There were 175 up-regulated genes and 582 down-regulated genes identified in CCH compared to normal persons. Among down-regulated genes in CCH, many genes were related with cell cycle and proliferation, such as BUB1, CCNB1, CCNB2 and CENPA, which might disturb cell growth and proliferation. In addition, several down-regulated genes were associated with keratinization and differentiation of epidermal cells, such as SPRR1A, SPRR1B, and CALML5. In over-expressed genes, CALML6 might play important roles on the development of CCH. The results of qRT-PCR confirmed the accuracy and credibility of RNA-Seq analysis. This study provided a lot of valuable information about pathogenic mechanism of CCH, which could be used to better study CCH in the future. "
Comorbidity of dementia and age-related macular degeneration calls for clinical awareness: a meta-analysis.,"Retinal neurodegeneration is an early feature in the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy (DR). Autophagy is an intracellular catabolic process involved in protein and organelle degradation that has been linked in DR. Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) is a major polyphenol in green tea that has beneficial effects in diabetic. however, it is not currently known whether EGCG can regulate Mller cell autophagy. Here, we showed that EGCG increased autophagy by promoting the formation of autophagosomes, increasing lysosomal acidification, and stimulating autophagic flux in Mller cells, while high glucose (HG) induced a decrease in autophagy and an increase in apoptosis. However, retinal Mller cells in HG treated with EGCG showed autophagy machinery activation and reestablishment of cargo degradation, protecting the cells from apoptosis. EGCG could increase the ability of cells to proliferate by increasing autophagy. In an experimental model of diabetic retinopathy, EGCG reduced the reactive gliosis of Mller cells and decreased retinal damage. These results highlight that HG downregulates autophagy and accumulates P62 cargo due to lysosomal dysfunction and then increases apoptosis, which was reversed by treatment with EGCG. This finding might be valuable for developing a novel therapeutic strategy to treat DR. "
Anatomical and functional changes in neovascular AMD in remission: comparison of fibrocellular and fibrovascular phenotypes.,"Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common manifestation of inherited retinal diseases with high degree of genetic, allelic, and phenotypic heterogeneity. CEP250 encodes the C-Nap1 protein and has been associated with various retinal phenotypes. Here, we report the identification of a mutation (c.562C>T, p.R188*) in the CEP250 in a consanguineous family with nonsyndromic RP. To gain insights into the molecular pathomechanism underlying CEP250 defects and the functional relevance of CEP250 variants in humans, we conducted a functional characterization of CEP250 variant using a novel Cep250 knockin mouse line. Remarkably, the disruption of Cep250 resulted in severe impairment of retinal function and significant retinal morphological alterations. The homozygous knockin mice showed significantly reduced retinal thickness and ERG responses. This study not only broadens the spectrum of phenotypes associated with CEP250 mutations, but also, for the first time, elucidates the function of CEP250 in photoreceptors using a newly established animal model.

Combined subconjunctival injection of dexamethasone for the management of acute primary angle closure: a randomised controlled trial.,"A precise phenotypic characterization of retinal dystrophies is needed for disease modeling as a basis for future therapeutic interventions. To compare genotype, phenotype, and structural changes in patients with rod-cone dystrophy (RCD) associated with mutations in PDE6A or PDE6B. In a retrospective cohort study conducted in Paris, France, from January 2007 to September 2017, 54 patients from a cohort of 1095 index patients with RCD underwent clinical examination, including personal and familial history, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision, slitlamp examination, full-field electroretinography, kinetic visual fields (VFs), retinophotography, optical coherence tomography, near-infrared fundus autofluorescence, and short-wavelength fundus autofluorescence imaging. Genotyping was performed using microarray analysis, targeted next-generation sequencing, and Sanger sequencing validation with familial segregation when possible. Data were analyzed from September 1, 2017, to February 1, 2018. Clinical variables were subsequently analyzed in 2018. Phenotype and genotype comparison of patients carrying mutations in PDE6A or PDE6B. Of the 54 patients included in the study, 19 patients of 17 families (11 women [58%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 14.83 [10.63] years) carried pathogenic mutations in PDE6A, and 35 patients of 26 families (17 women [49%]; mean [SD] age at diagnosis, 21.10 [11.56] years) had mutations in PDE6B, accounting for prevalences of 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively. Among 49 identified genetic variants, 14 in PDE6A and 15 in PDE6B were novel. Overall, phenotypic analysis revealed no substantial differences between the 2 groups except for night blindness as a presenting symptom that was noted to be more prevalent in the PDE6A than PDE6B group (80% vs 37%, respectively; P=.005). The mean binocular BCVA and VF decrease over time (measured as mean individual slopes coefficients) was comparable between patients with PDE6A and PDE6B mutations: 0.04 (0.12) vs 0.02 (0.05) for BCVA (P=.89) and 14.33 (7.12) vs 13.27 (6.77) for VF (P=.48). Mutations in PDE6A and PDE6B accounted for 1.6% and 2.4%, respectively, in a cohort of French patients with RCD. The functional and structural findings reported may constitute the basis of disease modeling that might be used for better prognostic estimation and candidate selection for photoreceptor therapeutic rescue.

Expression of prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> receptor 3 in the eyelid epidermis of patients with Stevens-Johnson syndrome/toxic epidermal necrolysis.,"The Infectious Diseases Society of America recommends ophthalmologic examinations for everyone with positive Candida blood culture results (candidemia) to screen for endophthalmitis, a practice that remains controversial because of multiple concerns for its limited usefulness and potential for harm. To determine guideline efficacy by reconciling discrepancies in the incidence of endophthalmitis and evaluating outcomes of studies assessing ophthalmologic screening for candidemia. PubMed literature searches, including the search terms candidemia, fungemia, chorioretinitis, and endophthalmitis, identified longitudinal studies prior to 2018 of patients who underwent ophthalmologic evaluations in the setting of positive fungal blood culture results regardless of symptoms or clinical status. Additional studies not captured by these queries were found by manually scanning references within the articles captured by the queries. Ambiguous studies of patients with concomitant bacterial or viral infections were excluded. Thirty-eight applicable studies of 7472 patients who underwent ophthalmologic screening for candidemia or fungemia were identified. Criteria were compared with the conventional definition of endophthalmitis based on present (concordant) or absent (discordant) frank vitreous involvement. Concordant (59 of 6693 [0.9%]) and discordant (114 of 779 [14.6%]) endophthalmitis incidence rates differed by 13.8% (95% CI, 11.4%-16.4%; P<.001). Visual acuity for each case was recorded verbatim as subjective report provided by each study, when available. None of the concordant endophthalmitis cases reported direct, intraocular, microscopic evidence of Candida or other fungal organisms. Outcomes were available for 19 patients with concordant endophthalmitis; 6 died within 4 weeks of screening. The rate of substantial vision loss was associated (=0.58; 95% CI, 0.01-0.86; P=.046) with additional invasive intervention (3 of 6 [50.0%]) compared with medical management alone (0 of 6). In this systematic review without meta-analysis, inconsistent definitions of endophthalmitis accounted for discrepancies of its incidence and overreporting among patients with candidemia, contributing to bias and resulting in the construction of guidelines. As few as 3 of 7472 patients had potential improvement, while routine examination overall could lead to additional interventions and harm in this population. These findings suggest that indiscriminate screening based on candidemia alone does not appear to be supported by the literature and should be reevaluated for inclusion as a recommendation from the Infectious Diseases Society of America.

AAV Engineering Identifies a Species Barrier That Highlights a Portal to the Brain.,"Polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV) is a major cause of visual loss worldwide, particularly in Asia, and the appropriate understanding of the structures in PCV previously described as polypoidal lesions is important for understanding their pathogenesis, diagnosis, and prognosis. To report the morphologic characteristics of polypoidal lesions and their association with branching vascular networks (BVNs) in eyes with PCV using swept-source optical coherence tomographic angiography (SS-OCTA). This cross-sectional observational study included 20 participants recruited from Shanghai General Hospital with a diagnosis of PCV based on the presence of focal hyperfluorescent spots on indocyanine green angiography (ICGA). Data were collected from December 1, 2017, to September 1, 2018, and analyzed from June 1 through September 30, 2018. Polypoidal lesions in eyes with PCV were characterized using multimodal imaging that included fundus photography, fluorescein angiography, ICGA, SS-OCT, and SS-OCTA, and the images were anatomically aligned. Subfoveal choroidal thickness was manually measured as the distance between the Bruch membrane and the sclerochoroidal interface on the SS-OCT images. Of the 20 Asian patients, 5 (25%) were women and 15 (75%) were men. The mean (SD) age was 61.1 (7.6) years, and the mean (SD) logMAR visual acuity was 0.358 (0.294) (Snellen equivalent, 20/50 [20/40]). Twenty-three eyes underwent imaging and were diagnosed with PCV. Indocyanine green angiography identified 43 polypoidal lesions, and all corresponded to the structures that appeared as clusters of tangled vessels on SS-OCTA images. In addition, SS-OCTA detected 16 tangled vascular structures not seen on ICGA. Branching vascular networks were detected on SS-OCTA imaging in all eyes, but ICGA identified BVNs in only 17 of 23 eyes (74%). Of the 43 tangled vascular structures, 40 (93%) were located at the edge of a BVN and 3 (7%) were associated with type 2 neovascularization. In eyes with PCV undergoing SS-OCTA imaging, previously described polypoidal lesions may appear as tangled vascular structures associated with BVN or type 2 neovascularization. The identification of polypoidal lesions in patients with PCV as neovascular tangles rather than actual polypoidal lesions or aneurysmal dilatations may help facilitate understanding of their pathogenesis and response to treatment.

Intravitreal dexamethasone implant for central retinal vein occlusion without macular edema.,"Complex interactions between HSV-1 and infiltrating immune cells play important roles in establishing localized, acute virus replication as well as chronic latent infection. The extent and duration of initial virus replication are the key determinants of subsequent pathologic inflammatory responses and therefore, the accumulation of immune cell populations at this time point is a key target for prevention. Therefore, we evaluated the role of various immune cell infiltrates between 1 h and 28 days post-infection (PI) using mice infected with virulent HSV-1 strain McKrae without corneal scarification. The effect of corneal scarification on immune cell infiltrates was also determined. We first determined the activation status and origin of macrophage infiltrates as early as 1 h PI. We found a sharp increase in the total macrophage population after 12 h PI, that was primarily due to infiltration of CCR2+ migratory macrophages, mostly in M1 status (MHC II+). The number of CCR2- resident macrophages, mostly unpolarized (M0), increased gradually over time and peaked at 48 h PI. Interestingly, some of the resident macrophages gained an M2-like phenotype (CD206Low), which peaked at 12 h PI, concurrent with M1 macrophage infiltration. From 1-7 days PI, infiltration of various immune cells correlated strongly with HSV-1 replication, with neutrophils showing the biggest increase, and NKT cells the biggest decrease, after infection. The presence of geographical ulcer did not correlate with increased infiltration, while mice with corneal scarring had significantly more immune cell infiltration than those without corneal scarring. Overall, we showed time-dependent infiltration of various immune cells in the eye of HSV-1 infected mice. Initial infiltration of macrophages followed by infiltration of T cells at later times PI demonstrates the importance of targeting macrophages rather than other immune cells type, for therapeutic treatment of HSV-1.

Anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal therapy and macular ganglion cell layer thickness in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration.,"To measure myopia, glasses wear and free glasses acceptance among minority and Han children in China. Visual acuity testing and questionnaires assessing ethnicity, study time, and parental and teacher factors were administered to a population-based sample of 9-12 year old minority and Han children in Yunnan and Guangdong, and their teachers and parents. Refraction was performed on children with uncorrected visual acuity (VA) < = 6/12 in either eye, and acceptance of free glasses assessed. Baseline myopia (uncorrected visual acuity < = 6/12 in > = 1 eye and spherical equivalent refractive power < = -0.5D in both eyes); baseline glasses wear; free glasses acceptance. Among 10,037 children (mean age 10.6 years, 52.3% boys), 800 (8.0%) were myopic, 4.04% among Yunnan Minority children (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.33, 0.67, P<0.001), 6.48% in Yunnan Han (OR 0.65, 95%CI 0.45, 0.93, P = 0.019), 9.87% in Guangdong Han (Reference). Differences remained significant after adjusting for study time and parental glasses wear. Difference in baseline glasses ownership (Yunnan Minority 4.95%, Yunnan Han 6.15%, Guangdong Han 15.3%) was not significant after adjustment for VA. Yunnan minority children (71.0%) were more likely than Yunnan Han (59.6%) or Guangdong Han (36.8%) to accept free glasses. The difference was significant after adjustment only compared to Guangdong Han (OR 3.34, 95% CI 1.62, 6.90, P = 0.001). Myopia is more common among Han children and in wealthier Guangdong. Baseline differences in glasses wear could be explained by student, teacher and parental factors. Yunnan Minority children were more likely to accept free glasses. "
Aqueous shunts with mitomycin C versus aqueous shunts alone for glaucoma.,"Fungal infections in lamellar keratoplasty are a growing concern. Optisol-GS does not contain an antifungal agent and supplementation with 0.255 g/mL Amphotericin B (AmpB) has been considered. This study tested the ability of 0.255 g/mL AmpB in Optisol-GS to eliminate yeast contamination of corneal tissue. Three isolates of Candida albicans, 1 of Candida parapsilosis, and 1 of Candida glabrata were tested in Optisol with and without AmpB. Corneoscleral rims stored at -80C were thawed and placed in 10 multiwell plates (4 per plate). The rims were inoculated with 4 respective loads of yeast: 0, 10, 10, and 10 colony-forming units in 2 sets of 5 for 5 yeasts. One set was filled with Optisol plus AmpB and the other with Optisol only. All 10 plates were incubated at cold storage (2C-8C) for 48 hours. After 48 hours, all corneal rims were placed into 10 mL of yeast extract peptone dextrose medium; a swab culture of each well was plated onto Sabouraud plates; and all plates with the remaining Optisol were incubated at 30C. Yeast growth was monitored for 10 days. Minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum fungicidal concentration were determined. All corneoscleral specimens were positive regardless of fungal load or presence of AmpB. All controls remained negative. Minimum inhibitory concentrations and minimum fungicidal concentrations were equivalent and ranged between 0.5 and 2.0 g/mL. AmpB at a concentration of 0.255 g/mL in Optisol-GS at cold storage (2C-8C) over 48 hours did not eliminate yeast from corneal tissue. "
[Pupil disorders].,"To evaluate the microbiological profile and outcome in cases with infective keratitis in Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS). Eighty-three eyes of 68 patients with SJS presenting with microbial keratitis were recruited and managed with standard antimicrobial therapy. Microbial keratitis developed in 34% of patients with SJS (83 eyes, 68 patients) over a period of 5 years. Four eyes (4.8%) had a history of concurrent topical steroid use at the onset of keratitis. Mean baseline best-corrected visual acuity was 1.8  0.9 logMAR units. The site of corneal ulceration was central in 52 eyes (62.6%), paracentral in 17 eyes (20.5%), and peripheral in 14 eyes (16.8%). The mean ulcer area was 3.9  2.7 mm. Approximately 15 of 24 (62.5%) culture-positive eyes had bacterial infection, most of which (80%) were caused by Gram-positive bacteria. Polymicrobial infection was noted in 7 of 24 eyes (29.1%). Although 57 of 83 (68.6%) eyes healed with medical therapy, 26 of 83 (31.3%) eyes had corneal perforation and were managed with cyanoacrylate glue application (30.7%) or therapeutic keratoplasty (69.3%). Systemic infection as an inciting factor of SJS and an early presentation for keratitis were the major risk factors associated with corneal perforation. Large mean ulcer size, paracentral ulcers, and punctal involvement were associated with a good visual outcome. Infective keratitis in SJS is common, and unlike routine cases, surgical intervention is often required. However, the antibiotic sensitivity pattern suggests that resistance is not that high. "
[Botulinumtoxin in Ophthalmology].,"ATX-101 (deoxycholic acid injection) is approved for reduction of moderate or severe submental fat (SMF). To evaluate the efficacy and safety of ATX-101 in subjects with mild or extreme SMF. Adults with mild or extreme SMF (based on clinician assessment) were randomized to receive 6 treatments with ATX-101 or placebo. Efficacy end points, evaluated at 12 weeks after last treatment, included percentage of subjects who achieved 1-grade improvement in SMF from baseline based on both clinician and patient assessment (composite CR-1/PR-1 response) as well as multiple subject-reported outcomes. Safety end points included change in skin laxity and incidence of adverse events. Overall, 61.3% of ATX-101-treated subjects versus 6.7% of placebo-treated subjects with mild SMF and 89.3% versus 13.3% of subjects, respectively, with extreme SMF achieved a composite CR-1/PR-1 response (p < .001 for both). ATX-101-treated subjects also reported higher levels of satisfaction and greater reductions in the psychological impact of SMF versus placebo-treated subjects regardless of baseline SMF severity. Skin laxity was unchanged or improved in most of the subjects. Adverse events were mainly mild/moderate, transient, and associated with the injection site. ATX-101 was efficacious and well tolerated for reduction of mild or extreme SMF. "
Normal Visual Recovery after Optic Neuritis Despite Significant Loss of Retinal Ganglion Cells in Patients with Multiple Sclerosis.,"This review article aimed to highlight the application and use of artificial intelligence (AI) in optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging in ophthalmology. Artificial intelligence programs seek to simulate intelligent human behavior in computers. With an abundance of patient data, especially with the advent and growing use of imaging modalities such as OCT, AI programs provide us with the unique opportunity to analyze this plethora of information and assist in making clinical decisions in the field of ophthalmology. Groups around the world have developed and evaluated AI programs that gather data from diagnostic modalities, such as OCT, that assist in the diagnosis and management of ophthalmological diseases with a high accuracy. Artificial intelligence programs using OCT have the potential to play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of ophthalmological disease in the near future. Incorporation of AI in medicine, however, is not without its pitfalls. Some limitations of AI in ophthalmology are also discussed in this review. These include the deskilling of physicians due to increase in reliance on automation, inability of AI programs to take a holistic approach to clinical encounters with patients, requirement of pre-existing strong datasets to train AI programs, and the inability of AI programs to incorporate the ambiguity and variability that is intrinsic to the nature of clinical medicine.

Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion in Ipsilateral Harlequin Syndrome.,"The purpose of this study was to determine if a circadian rhythm exists in Schirmer's tear test (STT-1) values in a group of healthy adult cats. Twenty adult neutered Domestic Short-haired cats (DSH) were used in the study. Tear production was measured with the Schirmer tear test (STT-1) at 12 different time points over a 48-hour period. A significant difference (approximately 4.3mm/min) was noted between STT-1 values measured between 4pm (lowest) and 12am (highest) on both day 1 (P=0.02) and day 2 (P=0.01), and substantial variation in STT-1 values was observed at different times during the 48-hour period. Significant variation in mean STT-1 values demonstrates that there is a circadian rhythm in tear production in cats and thus shows the importance of taking the time of day into account when measuring STT-1 in cats.

"Yasunari Nodules: A New Sensitive and Specific Marker of Neurofibromatosis Type 1, Readily Detectable by Ophthalmologists.","Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) produced by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2) is a signaling molecule involved in cell proliferation and formation of cellular junctions. In this study, we characterized the retinas of Sphk1 knockout (KO) mice by electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. We also tested cultured Mller glia for their response to S1P. We found that S1P plays an important role in retinal and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) structural integrity in aging mice. Ultrastructural analysis of Sphk1 KO mouse retinas aged to 15months or raised with moderate light stress revealed a degenerated outer limiting membrane (OLM). This membrane is formed by adherens junctions between neighboring Mller glia and photoreceptor cells. We also show that Sphk1 KO mice have reduced retinal function in mice raised with moderate light stress. In vitro assays revealed that exogenous S1P modulated cytoskeletal rearrangement and increased N-cadherin production in human Mller glia cells. Aged mice also had morphological degeneration of the RPE, as well as increased lipid storage vacuoles and undigested phagosomes reminiscent of RPE in age-related macular degeneration. These findings show that SPHK1 and S1P play a vital role in the structural maintenance of the mammalian retina and retinal pigmented epithelium by supporting the formation of adherens junctions. "
[Acute Juvenile Ophthalmoplegia (Miller Fisher Syndrome): an Interesting Case].,"Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease characterized by the development of multiple jaw keratocysts and basal cell carcinomas (BCC) and accompanied by diverse phenotypes. The establishment of diagnosis lies on the identification of a heterozygous germline pathogenic variant in the patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1). PTCH1 has alternative splicing and selective initial coding exon, leading to three types of encoding proteins (PTCHL, PTCHM and PTCHS). The expression of each protein in NBCCS remains ambiguous, especially the importance of the first two exons in translation. Here, we report a Chinese NBCCS family of a novel PTCH1 heterozygous mutation (IVS 2, c.394+1G>T, g.10652G>T) identified by genomic sequencing and reverse-transcription-PCR as aberrant splicing. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of NBCCS with a splicing site mutation in intron 2 resulting in exon 2 skipping. Our finding suggests that exon 2 plays an important role in the development of NBCCS and further speculates that the role of longer isoforms PTCHL and PTCHM is crucial in NBCCS, while that of short isoform PTCHS might be dispensable.

Distant Subconjunctival Recurrences following Proton Therapy for a Choroidal Melanoma with Extrascleral Extension.,"To elucidate the imaging findings of congenital oculomotor nerve palsy by evaluating the oculomotor nerve and extraocular muscles on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in arelatively large series of 14patients with congenital oculomotor nerve palsy. Ophthalmologic examination of 14consecutive patients diagnosed with congenital oculomotor nerve palsy, and MR imaging of the orbit and oculomotor nerves were performed. Of the 14patients with congenital oculomotor nerve palsy, 13patients (93%) were unilateral and 12patients (86%) had incomplete palsy. On MR imaging, 5patients (36%) had hypoplasia or aplasia of the oculomotor nerve with variable degrees of extraocular muscle atrophy on the affected side. Of the 14patients, nine (64%) had normal-sized oculomotor nerves with or without muscle atrophy. The most frequently involved muscles were the inferior rectus (64%) and medial rectus (50%), followed by the superior rectus (29%) and inferior oblique muscles (14%). None of the 14patients showed an abnormal abducens nerve. Congenital oculomotor nerve palsy was mostly incomplete and hypoplasia or aplasia of the oculomotor nerve was apparent in one third of patients showing variable degrees of extraocular muscle atrophy, mostly of the medial rectus and inferior rectus muscles.

Use of Autologous Oral Mucosa Transplant to Treat Conjunctival Necrosis and Leakage after Trabeculectomy.,"Report 5-year outcomes of patients receiving anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) for the treatment of macular oedema secondary to retinal vein occlusion (RVO. Retrospective review of eyes with RVO which initiated anti-VEGF treatment. Data including age, gender, visual acuity (VA) and injection numbers were obtained from medical records. Optical coherence tomography scans were graded for presence or absence of macular oedema and central foveal thickness (CFT). Macular perfusion was assessed on fundus fluorescein angiography by masked graders. 68 eyes (31 branch RVO, BRVO; 35 central RVO, CRVO and 2 hemi-RVO) with 5 years of follow-up after initiation of anti-VEGF treatment. Mean change in VA at 5years was + 9.6  21.6 letters among CRVO eyes and + 14.2  15.6 letters among eyes with BRVO (p=0.001). Vision of 20/40 or better was achieved in 65 % of treated eyes. The proportion of eyes with a three-line improvement of vision (15 letters) at 5years was 22 %. Mean CFT decreased by 257.6  249.8m in eyes with CRVO and 145.6  143.3 m in eyes with BRVO. The results confirm good long-term outcomes can be achieved with anti-VEGF therapy for RVO. "
Nonstandard Treatment of Endophthalmitis after Osteo-Odonto Keratoprothesis.,"The aim of this study is to ascertain the prevalence and causes of childhood blindness and severe visual impairment (BL/SVI) in Huidong, South China. This cross-sectional study was conducted in early 2017 in areas of 139 816 children at the age of 0-15 as the study subjects. We used the trained key informants (KIs) to do preliminary visual test in the communities and refer those children suspected with blindness or unable to count fingers with both eyes at 5 m to hospital for further examination by paediatric ophthalmologist for causes. The WHO's definition of BL/SVI was used, as blindness is best-corrected visual acuity worse than 0.05 in better eye and SVI is equal to or better than 0.05 but worse than 0.1 in better eye. Three hundred and fourteen KIs were trained. In total, 42 children with BL/SVI were found, and among them over half (22, 52.4%) were due to posterior segment disorders by anatomic site and 18 (42.9%) children were potentially preventable; these included BL/SVI caused by factors at children's development in intrauterine and after birth. This established the prevalence of BL/SVI was at 0.31/1000 (95% CI 0.28 to 0.34/1000). A low prevalence of childhood blindness was documented in this study. Establishment of surveillance system for disabled children including those with BL/SVI and better health education on eye care to the public according to the surveillance outcomes would help to reduce avoidable children's BL/SVI further in China.

Successful Big Bubble-Assisted Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty in a Patient with Intracorneal Ring Segments and Previous Corneal Collagen Cross-Linking for Keratoconus.,"The ubiquitin-proteasome system pathway has been recognised as a crucial cellular mechanism for the proper function of photoreceptor cells. In particular, ubiquitin ligases (E3s) recognise and ubiquitinate specific proteins for degradation. The KLHL7 protein (a BTB-Kelch protein) has been found to play an important role in this process. There have been several reports that heterozygous mutations in the <i>KLHL7</i> gene in adults are responsible for a rare cause of late-onset autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa with preservation of central vision and homozygous mutations in two young children, with Crisponi syndrome (CS)/cold-induced sweating syndrome type 1, result in a recessive form of early-onset peripheral retinal dystrophy type changes. The majority of children do not survive through to adulthood. The objective of this study is to report the visual symptoms and signs of two young adults clinically diagnosed with overlapping BOS/Cisproni syndrome, expanding the phenotypic presentation of KLHL7 gene mutations. This is a case report of the ophthalmic findings of two siblings with biallelic KLHL7 gene mutations. Siblings born to a non-consanguineous family and diagnosed with the overlapping clinical phenotype of Bohring-Opitz and and confirmed biallelic KLHL 7 gene mutation by whole exome sequencing were identified. Ophthlamic history and fundal examination was performed and analysed. Both patients had similar retinal findings. The fundus shows confluent hypopigmented/pale yellow lesions in the mid-periphery. The optic disc appears to be pale with a ring of atrophy and vessels appear attenuated. The macular of the younger patient shows a depigmented area around the fovea giving a bull's-eye appearance while the older sibling shows a fibrotic ring around the fovea suggesting a more advanced pathology. This paper expands the retinal phenotype to include a distinctive maculopathy in a recently described homozygous mutation in the <i>KLHL7</i> gene in two young adults presenting with features that overlap the Bohring-Opitz syndrome and CS.

Corneal Endothelial Decompensation after Ocular Chemical Burn: Description of a New Finding.,"Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) decreases the use of energy and provides a more precise capsulorhexis compared with conventional phaco surgery (CPS). The purpose of this study was to examine if the lower energy use in FLACS caused less endothelial cell loss compared with CPS and if there was a difference in refractive predictability between CPS and FLACS. This was a randomised controlled study of 96 patients with a 6-month follow-up comparing one eye surgery by FLACS and the contralateral eye operated by CPS (divide and conquer technique). Both eyes had intraocular aspheric lenses implanted. Uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA), central corneal endothelial cell count and hexagonality (non-contact endothelial cell microscope) were assessed preoperatively at 40 and at 180 days postoperatively. The mean phaco energies were 6.55 (95% CI 5.43 to 7.66) and 9.77 (95% CI 8.55 to 10.95)U/S (p<0.0001) by FLACS and CPS, respectively. At day 40, the mean endothelial cell loss (ECL) was 344 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (95%CI 245 to 443) by FLACS (12.89%) and 497 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (95%CI 380 to 614) by CPS (18.19%) (p=0.027). At day 180, ECL was 362 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (95%CI 275 to 450) in FLACS (13.56%) and 465 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> (95%CI 377 to 554) in CPS (17.03%) (p=0.036).The mean absolute difference from the attempted refraction was 0.43 (95% CI 0.36 to 0.51) dioptres (D) at day 40 and 0.46 D (95% CI 0.39 to 0.53) at day 180 by FLACS compared with 0.43 D (95% CI 0.36 to 0.51) at day 40 (p=0.95) and 0.46 D (95% CI 0.37 to 0.52) at day 180 (p=0.91) with CPS. ECL was significantly lower in FLACS compared with CPS at both day 40 and day 180. ECL was correlated to the energy used. We found no difference in refractive predictability or CDVA between the groups. "
Choroidal Neovascularisation Complicating Chronic Central Serous Chorioretinopathy: The Discovery Rate on Multimodal Imaging.,"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is a major cause of blindness in newborn infants, which also occurs in low-income and middle-income countries. Why ROP progresses in some infants while it regresses in others is still presently unknown. Studies suggest that genetic factors might be involved. Mutations in the Norrie disease (ND) gene are suspected to be related to advanced ROP development. Indonesia is a country with relatively high incidence of ROP, yet the role of these genetic factors in the pathogenesis of ROP cases is still unknown. The study aimed to investigate the presence of mutations in ND on the X chromosome in infants with both non-advanced and advanced ROP in Indonesia. This is a case-control study of polymorphisms in six variants within the ND gene in exon 3, C597A, L108P, R121W, A105T, V60E and C110G, in preterm newborn infants in four major hospitals in Greater Jakarta, Indonesia. We included 162 preterm newborn infants. ROP was diagnosed in 83 infants, and 79 infants served as controls. Among those with ROP, 57 infants had type 2, while others had type 1. We did not find any gene polymorphisms in any of the infants with ROP nor in the control group. We conclude that it is very unlikely that the six polymorphisms in exon 3 of the ND gene studied in this paper are involved in the development or progression of ROP in preterm infants in our population sample in Indonesia.

The Assessment of Blood Flow Velocities in Retinal Collaterals in Diabetic Retinopathy.,"To estimate magnitude of diabetes mellitus (DM) and diabetic retinopathy (DR) in a high risk population in Pune, western India. DR module in rapid assessment of avoidable blindness (RAAB) survey methodology was used. Sample size of 3527 was calculated based on estimates from previous studies in India. A certified RAAB trainer conducted a training of survey teams. Random cluster sampling with probability proportionate to size was adapted to select 60 clusters consisting of 60 individuals each. Two teams visited door to door until they finished visiting 60 persons each day. Visual acuity testing, torch light examination, red glow test were carried out to determine persons with visual impairment and its cause. Every participant then underwent a random blood sugar level testing. All diabetics (known and newly detected) underwent dilated retina evaluation with indirect ophthalmoscopy to determine their DR status. Data were entered into RAAB6 software and descriptive statistics generated. Response rate was 89.5 % (3221/3600), females (55.3%). The prevalence of DM in the sample was (706/3221) 21.9 %(95CI 20.1 to 23.7). Prevalence of DR was 14.3 % (95% CI 11.7 to 16.9). Most diabetics (401/579, 69.3%) never had an eye examination for DR in the past. Cataract was the principal cause of blindness (50 % cases) among diabetics. DM affects over fifth of persons above 50 years of age in western India. Nearly seventh of the diabetics have DR, but coverage of screening is poor in Pune. "
"Repeat Surgery for Patients Operated in Childhood for Early-Onset Esotropia and Suffering from Persistent Residual, Recurrent or Consecutive Strabismus.","The purpose of the present study is to describe the clinical and histopathological features of conjunctival inverted papilloma, to analyse for the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV), and to determine if HPV infection is associated with this type of tumour and its inverted growth pattern. Cases of conjunctival inverted papillomas were retrieved from the archives of the Department of Pathology, Rigshospitalet, Denmark. Patient records and pathology reports were reviewed. Formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue was analysed for the presence of HPV by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridisation (ISH), PCR and HPV typed by sequencing. A total of four cases were retrieved. The age at diagnosis ranged from 41 to 77 years, with an equal sex distribution. All lesions were localised to the bulbar conjunctiva and two of the cases were pigmented. Histopathological examination did not reveal areas of dysplasia. All lesions were p16-positive and p53-positive by immunohistochemistry. High-risk HPV 58 was demonstrated in one lesion by ISH and PCR. Here we present four cases of conjunctival inverted papilloma, which is an exceedingly rare tumour with only 11 previously reported cases in the literature. Both clinically and histopathologically, the tumours show distinct features compared with exophytic conjunctival papillomas. Furthermore, this is the first description of high-risk HPV 58 in a conjunctival tumour. The biological behaviour of the tumour is uncertain due to its rareness. However, a complete removal of the lesion and a careful observation are recommended. The finding of HPV 58 underlines the necessity of this precaution. "
"A Simple, Inexpensive, and Precise Photographic Method for Intraoperative Toric IOL Alignment.","Explore relationships between systemic exposure to intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) and systemic pharmacodynamic effects via post hoc analyses of clinical trials of IAI for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) or diabetic macular oedema (DME). Adults from VGFT-OD-0702.PK (n=6), VGFT-OD-0512 (n= 5), VIEW 2 (n=1204) and VIVID-DME (n=404) studies were included. Validated ELISAs were used to measure concentrations of free and bound aflibercept (reported as adjusted bound) in plasma at predefined time points in each study. Non-compartmental analysis of concentration-time data was obtained with dense sampling in VGFT-OD-0702.PK and VGFT-OD-0512. Sparse sampling was used in VIEW 2 and VIVID-DME. Blood pressure or intrarenal function changes were also investigated. Following intravitreal administration, free aflibercept plasma concentrations quickly decreased once maximum concentrations were achieved at 1-3 days postdose; pharmacologically inactive adjusted bound aflibercept concentrations increased over a longer period and reached plateau 7 days postdose. Ratios of free and adjusted bound aflibercept decreased over time. There were no meaningful changes in systolic/diastolic blood pressure over the duration of each study at all systemic aflibercept exposure levels. For all treatment arms in VIEW 2, there was no clinically relevant change in mean intrarenal function from baseline at week 52. Overall, incidence of systemic adverse events in VIEW 2 and VIVID-DME was low and consistent with the known safety profile of IAI. IAI administration was not associated with systemic effects in patients with nAMD or DME as measured by blood pressure or intrarenal function, two known pharmacologically relevant effects of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor.

A Rhesus Monkey With a Naturally Occurring Impairment of Disparity Vergence. II. Abnormal Near Response Cell Activity in the Supraoculomotor Area.,"The development of standardised methods for ultrasound (US) scanning and evaluation of synovitis activity by the OMERACT-EULAR Synovitis Scoring (OESS) system is a major step forward in the use of US in the diagnosis and monitoring of patients with inflammatory arthritis. The variation in interpretation of disease activity on US images can affect diagnosis, treatment and outcomes in clinical trials. We, therefore, set out to investigate if we could utilise neural network architecture for the interpretation of disease activity on Doppler US images, using the OESS scoring system. Two state-of-the-art neural networks were used to extract information from 1342 Doppler US images from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). One neural network divided images as either healthy (Doppler OESS score 0 or 1) or diseased (Doppler OESS score 2 or 3). The other to score images across all four of the OESS systems Doppler US scores (0-3). The neural networks were hereafter tested on a new set of RA Doppler US images (n=176). Agreement between rheumatologist's scores and network scores was measured with the kappa statistic. For the neural network assessing healthy/diseased score, the highest accuracies compared with an expert rheumatologist were 86.4% and 86.9% with a sensitivity of 0.864 and 0.875 and specificity of 0.864 and 0.864, respectively. The other neural network developed to four class Doppler OESS scoring achieved an average per class accuracy of 75.0% and a quadratically weighted kappa score of 0.84. This study is the first to show that neural network technology can be used in the scoring of disease activity on Doppler US images according to the OESS system. "

Behavioral Comparisons to Vergence in a Normal Animal.,"Implantable collamer lenses (ICL) carry a risk of prolapse caused by direct ocular trauma, especially in mesopic conditions and when oversized ICLs are implanted. We recommend early surgical repositioning, as well as patient education that encourages goggle use during active sports. "
Retinal oximetry: Metabolic imaging for diseases of the retina and brain.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a rare childhood malignant disorder caused by the biallelic inactivation of the <i>RB1</i> gene. Early diagnosis and identification of carriers of heritable mutations in <i>RB1</i> can improve disease outcome and management. In this study, we present the spectrum of mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene in Vietnamese patients with RB. Tumor RNA from 50 probands with RB, including 12 bilateral and 38 unilateral cases, was extracted. cDNA, after reverse transcription, was sequenced to identify the RNA mutation of the <i>RB1</i> gene. At the genomic DNA level, mutational analysis of all <i>RB1</i> exons, exon-intron boundaries, and the promoter region was conducted using PCR and direct sequencing. Multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) analysis was performed for patients for whom the first two results were negative. For patients for whom either the sequencing or MLPA results were positive for a tumor mutation, patients' and their parents' blood DNA was analyzed to determine the germline mutation. Forty-one different kinds of <i>RB1</i> tumor mutations were identified in 41 probands (82.0%), including 11 of 12 bilateral cases (91.7%) and 30 of 38 unilateral cases (78.9%). The majority of the detected mutations were nonsense (15 different kinds), followed by frameshift (11 kinds), and splice site mutations (nine kinds). Each splice site mutation was confirmed to create a deletion of the corresponding exon with RNA sequencing. The single promoter mutation c.-197G>A was reported previously; however, both missense mutations identified in exon 6 (c.601G>C: p.A201P) and exon 22 (c.2264T>C: p.F755S) were novel. Gross deletions were detected with MLPA in three probands. The detection rate of germline mutations in bilateral and unilateral cases with mutations were 81.8% and 30.0%, respectively. Only one father out of the 20 parents tested was positive for a germline mutation. Mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene in Vietnamese patients were heterogeneous and highly prevalent with pathogenic truncated mutations. With advancement in therapeutics, early detection of RB is important for eye salvation. "
Comparative transcriptome analysis of human conjunctiva between normal and conjunctivochalasis persons by RNA sequencing.,"To screen <i>RPE65</i> in 187 families with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). Sanger sequencing and/or targeted exome sequencing was employed to identify mutations in the <i>RPE65</i> gene, and intrafamilial cosegregation analysis if DNA was available. In silico analyses and splicing assay were used to evaluate the variants' pathogenicity. Genetic analysis revealed 15 mutations in <i>RPE65</i> in 14 pedigrees, including one splice-site mutation, one frameshift mutation, three nonsense mutations, and ten missense mutations. Of the mutations identified in <i>RPE65</i>, seven are novel associated with LCA, including five missense variants (c.124C>T, c.149T>C, c.340A>C, c.425A>G, and c.1399C>G) and two indel (insertions or deletions) variants (c.858+1delG and c.1181_1182insT). In vitro splicing assay was performed to evaluate the functional impact on RNA splicing of novel mutations if two of three in silico analyses were predicated to be non-pathogenic at the protein level. Among these 15 variants, 14 were classified as 'pathogenic variants,' and a variant (c.124C>T) was 'variants with uncertain significance' according to the standards and guidelines of the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics. Mutations in <i>RPE65</i> were responsible for 11 of the cohort of 187 Chinese families with LCA, which expands the spectrum of <i>RPE65</i>-related LCA in the Chinese population and potentially facilitates its clinical implementation.

Epigallocatechin-3-gallate stimulates autophagy and reduces apoptosis levels in retinal Mller cells under high-glucose conditions.,"In Bornholm eye disease, a defect in the splicing of transcripts from a variant <i>OPN1LW</i> opsin gene leads to a depletion in spliced transcript levels and, consequently, a reduction in photopigment in photoreceptors expressing the variant gene. Myopic and age-matched control subjects were drawn from the Western Australian Pregnancy Cohort (Raine) Study and the Norfolk Island Eye Study groups. The <i>OPN1LW</i> opsin gene was amplified using long-range PCR methodology and was fully sequenced. Expression of variant opsins was evaluated using quantitative PCR (qPCR). RNA secondary structure changes arising from identified variants were predicted by modeling. Forty-two nucleotide sites were found to vary across the 111 subjects studied. Of these, 15 had not been previously reported, with three present only in myopic individuals. Expression of these variants in transfected human embryonic kidney (HEK293T) cells demonstrated that splicing efficiencies were not affected. However, gene transcripts from two of the three variants were significantly depleted. RNA secondary structure modeling predicted that these single nucleotide changes could affect RNA stability. None of the variants identified in myopic individuals appeared to alter the efficiency of transcript splicing. However, two resulted in a significant reduction in the number of spliced and unspliced transcripts, indicating an overall reduction in steady-state transcript stability. Such a change would be expected to result in a reduced amount of photopigment, and this may be a contributing factor in the development of myopia. "
Functional characterization of CEP250 variant identified in nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa.,"To evaluate the efficacy of using a CRISPR/Cas-mediated strategy to correct a common high-risk allele that is associated with age-related macular degeneration (AMD; rs1061170; NM_000186.3:c.1204T>C; NP_000177.2:p.His402Tyr) in the complement factor H <i>(CFH)</i> gene. A human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK293A) was engineered to contain the pathogenic risk variant for AMD (HEK293A-CFH). Several different base editor constructs (BE3, SaBE3, SaKKH-BE3, VQR-BE3, and Target-AID) and their respective single-guide RNA (sgRNA) expression cassettes targeting either the pathogenic risk variant allele in the <i>CFH</i> locus or the <i>LacZ</i> gene, as a negative control, were evaluated head-to-head for the incidence of a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction. The base editor construct that showed appreciable editing activity was selected for further assessment in which the base-edited region was subjected to next-generation deep sequencing to quantify on-target and off-target editing efficacy. The tandem use of the Target-AID base editor and its respective sgRNA demonstrated a base editing efficiency of facilitating a cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction in 21.5% of the total sequencing reads. Additionally, the incidence of insertions and deletions (indels) was detected in only 0.15% of the sequencing reads with virtually no off-target effects evident across the top 11 predicted off-target sites containing at least one cytosine in the activity window (n = 3, pooled amplicons). CRISPR-mediated base editing can be used to facilitate a permanent and stably inherited cytosine-to-thymine nucleotide correction of the rs1061170 SNP in the <i>CFH</i> gene with minimal off-target effects.

Longitudinal Clinical Follow-up and Genetic Spectrum of Patients With Rod-Cone Dystrophy Associated With Mutations in PDE6A and PDE6B.,"To investigate eight previously unreported Pakistani families with genetically undefined OCA for mutations in TYR. Sanger sequencing of TYR has been performed in eight families with OCA phenotype. Mutation analysis was performed to establish the pathogenic role of novel mutation. Bioinformatics analysis was performed to predict the structural and functional impacts on protein due to the mutation. In this study, we identified six likely pathogenic variants of TYR (c.272 G>A, c.308 G>A, c.346C>T, c.715 C>T, c.832 C>T and c.1255 G>A), including one novel variant (c.308 G>A; p.Cys103Tyr), segregating as appropriate in each family. Cys103 lies in the highly conserved region of the tyrosinase enzyme, and p.Cys103Tyr is predicted to disturb enzymatic function via alteration of the configurational orientation of TYR leading to a more rigid polypeptide structure. We have also reviewed the mutation spectrum of TYR in Pakistani ethnicity. Published data on OCA families proposed that ~40% have been associated with genetic variations in the TYR gene. The mutations reported in this study have now been described with varying frequencies in Pakistani families, including very rare/unique mutations. A literature review of TYR gene mutations in Pakistani populations, combined with our genetic data, identified a number of gene mutations likely to represent regional ancestral founder mutations of relevance to Pakistani populations, in addition to sporadic and recurrent 'hotspot' mutations present repeatedly in other regions worldwide.

Utility of Ophthalmologic Screening for Patients With Candida Bloodstream Infections: A Systematic Review.,"We conduct supplementary analyses of the NEI VFQ-25 data to evaluate where changes occurred within subscales of the NEI VFQ-25 leading to change in the composite scores between the three treatment arms, and evaluate the NEI VFQ-25 with and without the Neuro 10 supplement. A prospective, multicentre, parallel, single-blind, three-arm RCT of fourteen UK acute stroke units was conducted. Stroke survivors with homonymous hemianopia were recruited. Interventions included: Fresnel prisms for minimum 2h, 5 days/week over 6-weeks (Arm a), Visual search training for minimum 30min, 5 days/week over 6-weeks (Arm b) and standard care-information only (Arm c). Primary and secondary outcomes (including NEI VFQ-25 data) were measured at baseline, 6, 12 and 26 weeks after randomisation. Eighty seven patients were recruited (69% male; mean age (SD) equal to 69 (12) years). At 26 weeks, outcomes for 24, 24 and 22 patients, respectively, were compared to baseline. NEI VFQ-25 (with and without Neuro 10) responses improved from baseline to 26 weeks with visual search training compared to Fresnel prisms and standard care. In subscale analysis, the most impacted across all treatment arms was 'driving' whilst the least impacted were 'colour vision' and 'ocular pain'. Composite scores differed systematically for the NEI VFQ-25 (Neuro 10) versus NEI VFQ-25 at all time points. For subscale scores, descriptive statistics suggest clinically relevant improvement in distance activities and vision-specific dependency subscales for NEI VFQ-25 scores in the visual search treatment arm.

Appearance of Polypoidal Lesions in Patients With Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Using Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomographic Angiography.,"BACKGROUND lncRNA BANCR participates in the pathogenesis of various types of human diseases; however, its involvement in diabetic retinopathy is unknown. MATERIAL AND METHODS In this study, the expression of lncRNA BANCR in plasma of patients with diabetic retinopathy, diabetic patients without complications, and healthy controls was analyzed by qRT-PCR. The accuracy plasma BANCR in diagnosing diabetic retinopathy was analyzed by ROC curve analysis. lncRNA BANCR expression vector and siRNA were transfected into the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, and cell apoptosis was analyzed by cell apoptosis assay. RESULTS We found that lncRNA BANCR was significantly upregulated in patients with diabetic retinopathy compared to diabetic patients without complications and healthy controls. Upregulation of lncRNA BANCR effectively distinguished patients with diabetic retinopathy from diabetic patients without complications and healthy controls. High-glucose treatment led to upregulated expression of BANCR in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19. Overexpression of BANCR promoted and siRNA silencing inhibited the apoptosis of cells in the human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19 in a high-glucose environment. CONCLUSIONS lncRNA BANCR is overexpressed in patients with diabetic retinopathy and can promote apoptosis of retinal pigment epithelial cells. "
Therapeutic Window for Phosphodiesterase 6-Related Retinitis Pigmentosa.,"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is characterized by increased mucus viscosity and delayed mucociliary clearance that contributes to progressive decline of lung function. Mucus in the respiratory and GI tract is excessively adhesive in the presence of airway dehydration and excess extracellular Ca2+ upon mucin release, promoting hyperviscous, densely packed mucins characteristic of CF. Therapies that target mucins directly through ionic interactions remain unexploited. Here we show that poly (acetyl, arginyl) glucosamine (PAAG), a polycationic biopolymer suitable for human use, interacts directly with mucins in a Ca2+-sensitive manner to reduce CF mucus viscoelasticity and improve its transport. Notably, PAAG induced a linear structure of purified MUC5B and altered its sedimentation profile and viscosity, indicative of proper mucin expansion. In vivo, PAAG nebulization improved mucociliary transport in CF rats with delayed mucus clearance, and cleared mucus plugging in CF ferrets. This study demonstrates the potential use of a synthetic glycopolymer PAAG as a molecular agent that could benefit patients with a broad array of mucus diseases. "
CCR2+ migratory macrophages with M1 status are the early-responders in the cornea of HSV-1 infected mice.,"The cellular insulator protein CTCF plays a role in HSV-1 latency through the establishment and regulation of chromatin boundaries. We previously found that the CTRL2 regulatory element downstream from the LAT enhancer was bound by CTCF during latency and underwent CTCF eviction at early times post-reactivation in mice latent with 17<i>syn</i>+. We also showed that CTRL2 was a functional enhancer-blocking insulator in both epithelial and neuronal cell lines. We hypothesized that CTRL2 played a direct role in silencing lytic gene expression during the establishment of HSV-1 latency. To test this hypothesis, we used a recombinant virus with a 135-bp deletion spanning only the core CTRL2 insulator domain (CTRL2) in the 17<i>syn</i>+ background. Deletion of CTRL2 resulted in restricted viral replication in epithelial cells, but not neuronal cells. Following ocular infection, mouse survival decreased in the CTRL2 cohort and we found a significant decrease in the number of viral genomes in mouse trigeminal ganglia (TG) infected with CTRL2, indicating that the CTRL2 insulator was required for the efficient establishment of latency. Immediate early (IE) gene expression significantly increased in the ganglia infected with CTRL2 by 31 days post-infection, relative to 17<i>syn</i>+, indicating that deletion of the CTRL2 insulator disrupted the organization of chromatin domains during HSV-1 latency. Finally, ChIP-seq analyses of TG from CTRL2 infected mice confirmed that the distribution of the repressive H3K27me3 mark on the CTRL2 recombinant genomes was altered compared to the wild-type, indicating that CTRL2 site modulates the repression of IE genes during latency.<b>IMPORTANCE</b> It is becoming increasingly clear that chromatin insulators play a key role in the transcriptional control of DNA viruses. The gamma herpesviruses EBV and KSHV utilize chromatin insulators to order protein recruitment and dictate the formation of 3-dimensional DNA loops that spatially control transcription and latency. The contribution of chromatin insulators in alpha herpesvirus transcriptional control is less understood. The work presented here begins to bridge that gap in knowledge by showing how one insulator site in HSV-1 modulates lytic gene transcription and heterochromatin deposition as the HSV-1 genome establishes latency.

"Population prevalence of myopia, glasses wear and free glasses acceptance among minority versus Han schoolchildren in China.","To determine the effect of erenumab, a human anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor monoclonal antibody, in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 667 adults with chronic migraine were randomized (3:2:2) to placebo or erenumab (70 or 140 mg), stratified by region and medication overuse status. Data from patients with baseline medication overuse at baseline were used to assess changes in monthly migraine days, acute migraine-specific medication treatment days, and proportion of patients achieving 50% reduction from baseline in monthly migraine days. Of 667 patients randomized, 41% (n = 274) met medication overuse criteria. In the medication overuse subgroup, erenumab 70 or 140 mg groups had greater reductions than the placebo group at month 3 in monthly migraine days (mean [95% confidence interval] -6.6 [-8.0 to -5.3] and -6.6 [-8.0 to -5.3] vs -3.5 [-4.6 to -2.4]) and acute migraine-specific medication treatment days (-5.4 [-6.5 to -4.4] and -4.9 [-6.0 to -3.8] vs -2.1 [-3.0 to -1.2]). In the placebo and 70 and 140 mg groups, 50% reductions in monthly migraine days were achieved by 18%, 36% (odds ratio [95% confidence interval] 2.67 [1.36-5.22]) and 35% (odds ratio 2.51 [1.28-4.94]). These clinical responses paralleled improvements in patient-reported outcomes with a consistent benefit of erenumab across multiple measures of impact, disability, and health-related quality of life. The observed treatment effects were similar in the non-medication overuse subgroup. Erenumab reduced migraine frequency and acute migraine-specific medication treatment days in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse, improving disability and quality of life. NCT02066415. This study provides Class II evidence that erenumab reduces monthly migraine days at 3 months in patients with chronic migraine and medication overuse. "
Effect of Optisol Supplementation With 0.255 g/mL Amphotericin B on Elimination of Yeast at 5C.,"The microenvironments of tissues or organs are complex architectures comprised of structural proteins including collagen. Particularly, the cornea is organized in a lattice pattern of collagen fibrils which play a significant role in its transparency. This paper introduces a transparent bioengineered corneal structure for transplantation. The structure is fabricated by inducing shear stress to a corneal stroma-derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink based on 3D cell-printing technique. The printed structure recapitulates the native macrostructure of the cornea with aligned collagen fibrils which results in the construction of a highly matured and transparent cornea stroma analogue. The level of shear stress, controlled by the various size of the printing nozzle, manipulates the arrangement of the fibrillar structure. With proper parameter selection, the printed cornea exhibits high cellular alignment capability, indicating tissue-specific structural organization of collagen fibrils. In addition, this structural regulation enhances critical cellular events in the assembly of collagen over time. Interestingly, the collagen fibrils that remodeled along with the printing path create a lattice pattern similar to the structure of native human cornea after 4 weeks in vivo. Taken together, these results establish the possibilities and versatility of fabricating aligned collagen fibrils; this represents significant advances in corneal tissue engineering. "
Microbial Keratitis in Stevens-Johnson Syndrome: A Prospective Study.,"In the mouse retina, more than 30 retinal ganglion cell (RGC) subtypes have been classified based on a combined metric of morphological and functional characteristics. RGCs arise from a common pool of retinal progenitor cells during embryonic stages and differentiate into mature subtypes in adult retinas. However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms controlling formation and maturation of such remarkable cellular diversity remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that T-box transcription factor T-brain 1 (Tbr1) is expressed in two groups of morphologically and functionally distinct RGCs: the orientation-selective J-RGCs and a group of OFF-sustained RGCs with symmetrical dendritic arbors. When Tbr1 is genetically ablated during retinal development, these two RGC groups cannot develop. Ectopically expressing Tbr1 in M4 ipRGCs during development alters dendritic branching and density but not the inner plexiform layer stratification level. Our data indicate that Tbr1 plays critical roles in regulating the formation and dendritic morphogenesis of specific RGC types. "
"A Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase 3b Study of ATX-101 for Reduction of Mild or Extreme Submental Fat.","Regulation of vascular permeability plays a major role in the pathophysiology of visually threatening conditions such as retinal vein occlusion and diabetic retinopathy. Principally, several factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), are up-regulated or induced in response to hypoxia thus adversely affecting the blood-retinal barrier (BRB), resulting in retinal edema and neovascularisation. Furthermore, current evidence supports a dysregulation of the inner retinal neural-vascular integrity as a critical factor driving retinal ganglion cell (RGC) death and visual loss. The principal objective of this study was to interrogate whether Substance P (SP), a constitutive neurotransmitter of amacrine and ganglion cells, may protect against N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA)-induced excitotoxic apoptosis of ganglion cells and VEGF-induced vessel leakage in the retina. Tight junctional protein expression and a Vascular Permeability Image Assay were used to determine vascular integrity in vitro. The protective effect of SP on RGC was established in ex vivo retinal explants and in vivo murine models. After NMDA administration, a reduction in TUNEL+cells and a maintained number of Brn-3a+cells were found, indicating an inhibition of RGC apoptosis mediated by SP. Additionally, SP maintained endothelial tight junctions and decreased VEGF-induced vascular permeability. In conclusion, administration of SP protects against NMDA apoptosis of RGC and VEGF-induced endothelial barrier breakdown. "
Artificial Intelligence and Optical Coherence Tomography Imaging.,"To correlate cone- and rod-mediated function with morphology of the macula in preterm-born children without and with spontaneously regressed retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). We performed spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) single scans in the macular center of preterm-born children aged 6 to 12 years (mean  SD, 7.4  1.8) without ROP (noROP; n = 59) and with spontaneously regressed ROP (srROP; n = 34), documented with wide-angle digital imaging during routine screening for acute ROP, and compared the data from 14 age-matched term-born children. SD-OCT data were compared to functional cone- and rod-mediated results of scotopic and photopic chromatic pupillometry (cP) and two-color fundus-controlled perimetry (2C-FCP). SD-OCT showed a shallowed foveal pit with significantly reduced outer nuclear layer to inner retinal layer ratio, indicating macular developmental arrest (MDA). MDA was present in 44% of the srROP and 27% of the noROP children. Pupil reaction to photopic red stimuli on blue background showed significantly lower values in all preterm-born children with MDA. In accordance, photopic light increment sensitivity (LIS) to red stimuli in the foveal center on the 2C-FCP was also significantly reduced in children with MDA. Under scotopic conditions, no significant differences were apparent in both pupil reaction with cP and LIS with 2C-FCP. Both objective pupillary response to cone-mediated photopic red stimuli and subjective central cone-mediated results in fundus-controlled perimetry were reduced in preterm-born children with MDA. MDA was present in a significant number of patients with srROP, but also without ROP. "
Pilot evaluation of the circadian rhythm of tear production in a population of healthy adult cats.,"We address the hypothesis that uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2), a cellular glucose regulator, delays physiologic retinal vascular development (PRVD) by interfering with glucose uptake through glucose transporter 1 (Glut1). In the rat 50/10 oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, retinal Glut1 and UCP2 were measured and compared to room air (RA)-raised pups at postnatal day 14 (p14). Pups in OIR and RA received intraperitoneal genipin, an UCP2 inhibitor, or control every other day from p3 until p13. Analyses at p14 included avascular/total retinal area (AVA), Western blots of retinal UCP2 and Glut1, and immunostaining of Glut1 in retinal cryosections. Intravitreal neovascular/total retinal area (IVNV) was analyzed at p18, and electroretinograms were performed at p26. Glut1 and phosphorylated VEGFR2 (p-VEGFR2), glucose uptake, adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production, and cell proliferation were measured in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (hRMVECs) pretreated with genipin or transfected with UCP2siRNA, Glut1siRNA, or control siRNA when incubated with VEGF or PBS. At p14, OIR pups had increased AVA with decreased Glut1 and increased UCP2 in the retina compared to RA retinas. Intraperitoneal genipin increased retinal Glut1 and reduced AVA. Compared to control, treatment with genipin or knockdown of UCP2 significantly increased Glut1, glucose uptake, ATP production, VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2 and cell proliferation in hRMVECs. Knockdown of Glut1 inhibited VEGF-induced p-VEGFR2. Genipin-treated OIR pups with decreased AVA at p14 had reduced IVNV at p18 and increased amplitudes in a- and b-waves at p26. Extending PRVD by increasing retinal endothelial glucose uptake may represent a strategy to prevent severe retinopathy of prematurity and vision loss. "
Sphingosine Kinase-1 Is Essential for Maintaining External/Outer Limiting Membrane and Associated Adherens Junctions in the Aging Retina.,"To compare the characteristics of macular and extramacular white spots on wide-field swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) images in diabetic retinopathy (DR). We retrospectively reviewed 107 eyes of 64 patients with DR, of whom nominal 12  12 mm SS-OCTA images centered on the optic disc and ultrawide field photographs were acquired. White spots on fundus photographs corresponded to hyperreflective lesions in the superficial en-face OCT images, and the characteristics of these white spots were investigated. We compared such OCT findings with the vertical and horizontal extents of nonperfused areas (NPAs) on OCTA images. We observed 136 white spots and corresponding hyperreflective lesions in 49 eyes. The hyperreflective lesions in the extramacular areas had greater areas (P < 0.001) and more frequently spanned from the nerve fiber layer to the outer plexiform layer (P < 0.001), while those in the macula were superficial. All of macular hyperreflective lesions were accompanied with nerve fiber layer defects, whereas only 18 (15.4%) of 117 extramacular lesions had them (P < 0.001). Comparative studies showed that most extramacular hyperreflective lesions corresponded to the NPAs in the whole layers on OCTA images, compared to the lamellar NPAs of the superficial layer in most of the macular lesions (P < 0.001). The NPAs extended to the peripheral side more frequently in the extramacular hyperreflective lesions compared with macular lesions (P < 0.001). This study proposed that most of the extramacular white spots may be discriminated from macular spots with respect to diabetic NPAs on OCTA images. "
A novel splicing mutation of PTCH1 in a Chinese family with nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.,"To systematically analyze thicknesses of retinal layers in an older population and their link to early age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In the AugUR baseline survey from a population aged 70 years, we conducted multimodal retinal imaging, including spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Autosegmentation of eight distinct retinal layers was followed by manual correction of segmentation errors. AMD status was graded on color fundus images according to the Three Continent AMD Consortium Severity Scale. We tested the association of early AMD on retinal layer thicknesses by using linear mixed models and replicated significant results in independent data also from the AugUR platform. When comparing layer thicknesses between early AMD and no AMD (822 eyes, 449 participants), the retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane complex demonstrated a statistically significant thickening (e.g., P = 6.41  10-92 for severe early versus no AMD) and photoreceptor layers showed a significant thinning. Autosegmented retinal layer thicknesses revealed similar associations as manually corrected values but underestimated some effects. Independent replication analysis in 1026 eyes (546 participants) confirmed associations (e.g., P = 9.38  10-36 for retinal pigment epithelium/Bruch's membrane complex, severe early versus no AMD). This first population-based study on spectral-domain optical coherence tomography-derived retinal layer thicknesses in a total of 1000 individuals provides insights into the reliability of autosegmentation and layer-specific reference values for an older population. Our findings show a difference in thicknesses between early AMD and no AMD for some retinal layers, suggesting these as potential imaging biomarkers. The thinning of photoreceptor layers substantiates a photoreceptor cell loss/damage already occurring in early AMD. "
"Statement and supplementary statement from the BVA, the DOG,and the RG on laser treatment of drusen in age-related macular degeneration (AMD) : August 2017, update October 2018.","To understand the role and further dissect pathways downstream of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) and the fibrinolytic pathway in modulating outflow facility. Outflow facility of tissue plasminogen activator (Plat) knockout (KO) mice was determined and compared to that of wild-type (WT) littermates. Gene expression of urokinase plasminogen activator (Plau), plasminogen activator inhibitor (Pai-1), plasminogen (Plg), and matrix metalloproteinases (Mmp-2, -9, and -13) was measured in angle tissues. Expression of the same genes and outflow facility were measured in KO and WT mice treated with triamcinolone acetonide (TA). Amiloride was used to inhibit urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) in Plat KO mice, and outflow facility was measured. Plat deletion resulted in outflow facility reduction and decreased Mmp-9 expression in angle tissues. Plasminogen expression was undetectable in both KO and WT mice. TA led to further reduction in outflow facility and decreases in expression of Plau and Mmp-13 in plat KO mice. Amiloride inhibition of uPA activity prevented the TA-induced outflow facility reduction in Plat KO mice. tPA deficiency reduced outflow facility in mice and was associated with reduced MMP expression. The mechanism of action of tPA is unlikely to involve plasminogen activation. tPA is not the only mediator of TA-induced outflow facility change, as TA caused reduction in outflow facility of Plat KO mice. uPA did not substitute for tPA in outflow facility regulation but abrogated the effect of TA in the absence of tPA, suggesting a complex role of components of the fibrinolytic system in outflow regulation. "
Magnetic Resonance Imaging in 14Patients with Congenital Oculomotor Nerve Palsy.,"To test the hypothesis that oxidative stress in the outer retina (OR = distance from external limiting membrane to the retinal pigment epithelium-choroid boundary) can be detected by using antioxidants (AOs) to correct an impaired light-evoked response as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). C57BL/6J mice were maintained in the dark for 20 hours and studied by OCT before and after 1 hour of light exposure. OR thickness in dark or light was measured, and the light-dark difference (i.e., the photoresponse) was calculated. Subgroups of mice were given either saline or d-cis-diltiazem (an inducer of transient and nondamaging OR oxidative stress)  methylene blue (24 hours before examination) and -lipoic acid (1 hour before examination); one group was kept only in the dark and given only AOs. In uninjected or saline-injected control mice, the OR showed a similar and reproducible light-induced expansion; dark-adapted mice given AOs did not increase dark-adapted OR thickness. The d-cis-diltiazem-treated mice had no photoresponse (P > 0.05). The d-cis-diltiazem-treated mice given AOs corrected (P < 0.05) the suppressed OR photoresponse, indicating the presence of oxidative stress. QUEnch-assiSTed (QUEST) OCT reproduced results from previous gold standard assays, showing that oxidative stress impairs the OR photoresponse and that d-cis-diltiazem produces OR oxidative stress. We envision future applications of QUEST OCT in a range of oxidative stress-based retinopathies. "
Five-year outcomes of retinal vein occlusion treated with vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors.,"We investigate morphologic and physiologic alterations of ganglion cells (GCs) in a streptozocin (STZ)-induced diabetic mouse model. Experiments were conducted in flat-mount retinas of mice 3 months after the induction of diabetes. Changes in morphology of four subtypes of GCs (ON-type RGA2 [ON-RGA2], OFF-type RGA2 [OFF-RGA2], ON-type RGC1 [ON-RGC1], and ON-OFF type RGD2 [ON-OFF RGD2]) were characterized in Thy1-YFP transgenic mice. Using whole-cell patch-clamp recording, passive membrane properties and action potential (AP) firing properties were further investigated in transient ON- and OFF-RGA2 cells. Morphologic parameters were significantly altered in the dendrites branching in the ON sublamina of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) for ON-RGA2 cells and ON-OFF RGD2 cells. Much less significant changes, if any, were seen in those arborizing in the OFF sublamina of the IPL for OFF-RGA2 and ON-OFF RGD2 cells. No detectable changes in morphology were seen in RGC1 cells. Electrophysiologically, increased resting membrane potentials and decreased membrane capacitance were found in transient ON-RGA2 cells, but not in transient OFF-RGA2 cells. Similar alterations in AP firing properties, such as an increase in AP width and reduction in maximum spiking rate, were shared by these two subtypes. Furthermore, in response to depolarizing current injections, both cells generated more APs suggesting an enhanced excitability of these cells in diabetic conditions. These differential changes in morphology and electrophysiology in subtypes of GCs may be responsible for reduced contrast sensitivity known to occur during the early stage of diabetic retinopathy. "
"Prevalence and causes of childhood blindness in Huidong County, South China, primary ascertained by the key informants.","We investigated whether cellular connectivity between Schlemm's canal (SC) inner wall (IW) endothelium, and juxtacanalicular connective tissue (JCT), and between IW endothelial cells, plays a role in giant vacuole (GV) and pore formation by comparing perfusion- and immersion-fixed eyes. Normal human donor eyes (n = 4) were either immersion-fixed (0 mm Hg) or perfusion-fixed (15 mm Hg). Trabecular meshwork near SC was imaged using serial block-face scanning electron microscopy. A total of 12 IW cells from each group were 3D-reconstructed from 7040 electron micrographs and compared. In each cell, connections between IW cells and JCT cells/matrix were quantified; IW/IW connectivity was measured by cell border overlap length. GV volume, density, shape, and intracellular and paracellular pores were analyzed. The mean number of IW/JCT cell-cell connections per cell significantly decreased (P < 0.01) while the summed GV volume per cell significantly increased (P < 0.01) in perfusion-fixed eyes compared to immersion-fixed eyes. Intracellular pores were observed in 14.6% of GVs in perfusion-fixed eyes and not observed in immersion-fixed eyes. The mean IW/IW overlap length per cell decreased (P < 0.01), and paracellular pores were found only in regions where IW/IW connectivity was minimal (overlap length = 0 m) in perfusion-fixed eyes and not observed in immersion-fixed eyes. Our data suggest that changes in IW/JCT connectivity may be an important factor in the formation of larger GVs, and decreased IW/IW connectivity may promote paracellular pore formation. Targeting the IW/JCT and IW/IW connectivity may therefore be a potential strategy to regulate outflow resistance and IOP.. "
New macular findings in individuals with biallelic KLHL7 gene mutation.,"We implemented optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A) in mice to: (1) develop quantitative parameters from OCT-A images, (2) measure the reproducibility of the parameters, and (3) determine the impact of experimental models of inner and outer retinal damage on OCT-A findings. OCT-A images were acquired with a customized system (Spectralis Multiline OCT2). To assess reproducibility, imaging was performed five times over 1 month. Inner retinal damage was induced with optic nerve transection, crush, or intravitreal N-methyl-d-aspartic acid injection in transgenic mice with fluorescently labeled retinal ganglion cells (RGCs). Light-induced retinal damage was induced in albino mice. Mice were imaged at baseline and serially post injury. Perfusion density, vessel length, and branch points were computed from OCT-A images of the superficial, intermediate, and deep vascular plexuses. The range of relative differences measured between sessions across the vascular plexuses were: perfusion density (2.8%-7.0%), vessel length (1.9%-4.1%), and branch points (1.9%-5.0%). In mice with progressive RGC loss, imaged serially and culminating in around 70% loss in the fluorescence signal and 18% loss in inner retinal thickness, there were no measurable changes in any OCT-A parameter up to 4 months post injury that exceeded measurement variability. However, light-induced retinal damage elicited a progressive loss of the deep vascular plexus signal, starting as early as 3 days post injury. Vessel length and branch points were generally the most reproducible among the parameters. Injury causing RGC loss in mice did not elicit an early change in the OCT-A signal. "
Comparison of refractive predictability and endothelial cell loss in femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and conventional phaco surgery: prospective randomised trial with 6 months of follow-up.,"To longitudinally evaluate the visual function and structure of patients taking ethambutol by various modalities and identify useful tests for detection of subclinical ethambutol-induced optic toxicity. This retrospective study enrolled 84 patients with newly diagnosed tuberculosis treated with ethambutol. Best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), color vision, contrast sensitivity, fundus and retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) photography, automated visual field (VF) test, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were performed: prior to starting; every month during administration, and 1 month after stoppage. We longitudinally compared visual function and structure with the baseline and identified the occurrence of subclinical toxicity. BCVA, color vision, and contrast sensitivity showed no change from the baseline. Mean temporal RNFL thickness was significantly increased at 6 months (p = 0.014). Subclinical toxicity was found in 22 eyes of 14 patients (i.e., 13% of 168 eyes), in the forms of VFI decrease (VF index, 9 eyes of 6 patients), quadrant RNFL thickness increase (5 eyes of 4 patients), and VF pattern defect (12 eyes of 6 patients). 73% of the patients showed recovery to the baseline at 1 month post-stoppage. The risk factors for occurrence of subclinical toxicity were age, cumulative dose, and medication duration. Mean temporal RNFL thickness increased after administration. The VFI, quadrant RNFL thickness, and VF pattern defect could prove useful in assessment of subclinical toxicity. Medication duration was shown to be a strong risk factor for occurrence of subclinical toxicity. "
Norrie disease gene polymorphism in Indonesian infants with retinopathy of prematurity.,"To investigate the clinical significance of color visual acuity (CVA) in preperimetric glaucoma (PPG) and open-angle glaucoma (OAG). A total of 123 eyes of 73 subjects (22 normal eyes, 14 PPG eyes, and 87 OAG eyes; mean age: 44.9  10.1 years, age range: 21-64 years) were enrolled. CVA was tested for red, green-yellow, blue-green and blue-purple with a newly developed test. There was no statistical difference in clinical background factors, including age, sex, intraocular pressure, or spherical equivalent between the three groups. Red VA and blue-green VA were significantly worse in the OAG eyes than in the normal eyes (P = 0.008 and P = 0.015, respectively), although green-yellow VA and blue-purple VA were not significantly worse. Furthermore, red VA and blue-green VA were significantly correlated with MD in a group of eyes with either PPG or OAG (r = -0.23, P = 0.023; r = -0.25, P = 0.012, respectively), but green-yellow VA and blue-purple VA were not. Red VA and blue-green VA were detectably worse in eyes with OAG, in close association with the degree of functional loss. This suggests that measuring CVA with the new color test described here may be a promising supplement to existing methods of detecting glaucoma and evaluating its severity. "
"Estimating the magnitude of diabetes mellitus and diabetic retinopathy in an older age urban population in Pune, western India.","Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT) is present in a significant number of adult humans and can be activated by exposure to cold. Measurement of active BAT presence, activity, and volume are desirable for determining the efficacy of potential treatments intended to activate BAT. The repeatability of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) measurements of BAT presence, activity, and volume under controlled conditions has not been extensively studied. Eleven female volunteers underwent double baseline FDG PET imaging performed following a simple, regional cold intervention intended to activate brown fat. The cold intervention involved the lightly-clothed participants intermittently placing their feet on a block of ice while sitting in a cooled room. A repeat study was performed under the same conditions within a target of two weeks. FDG scans were obtained and maximum standardized uptake value adjusted for lean body mass (SULmax), CT Hounsfield units (HU), BAT metabolic volume (BMV), and total BAT glycolysis (TBG) were determined according to the Brown Adipose Reporting Criteria in Imaging STudies (BARCIST) 1.0. A Lin's concordance correlation (CCC) of 0.80 was found for BMV between test and retest imaging. Intersession BAT SULmax was significantly correlated (r = 0.54; p < 0.05). The session #1 mean SULmax of 4.92  4.49 g/mL was not significantly different from that of session #2 with a mean SULmax of 7.19  7.34 g/mL (p = 0.16). BAT SULmax was highly correlated with BMV in test and retest studies (r  0.96, p < 0.001). Using a simplified ice-block cooling method, BAT was activated in the majority (9/11) of a group of young, lean female participants. Quantitative assessments of BAT SUL and BMV were not substantially different between test and retest imaging, but individual BMV could vary considerably. Intrasession BMV and SULmax were strongly correlated. The variability in estimates of BAT activity and volume on test-retest with FDG should inform sample size choice in studies quantifying BAT physiology and support the dynamic metabolic characteristics of this tissue. A more sophisticated cooling method potentially may reduce variations in test-retest BAT studies. "
Inverted papilloma of the conjunctiva.,"BACKGROUND Foveal hypoplasia (FH) is a congenital disorder, generally associated with other conditions. CASE REPORT A 9-year-old boy presented with moderately decreased vision in the left eye. Fundus examination showed an absence of macular reflection and no foveal pit was seen on optical coherence tomography. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated the absence of a foveal avascular zone. CONCLUSIONS This is a rare case of a unilateral fovea plana associated with a visual impairment. "
Systemic pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analysis of intravitreal aflibercept injection in patients with retinal diseases.,"It is generally thought that apart from receptive field differences, such as preferred orientation and spatial frequency selectivity, primary visual cortex neurons are functionally similar to each other. However the genetic diversity of cortical neurons plus the existence of inputs additional to those required to explain known receptive field properties, might suggest otherwise. Here we report the existence of desynchronised states in anesthetised cat area 17 lasting up to 45 minutes, characterised by variable narrow-band local field potential (LFP) oscillations in the range 2 - 100 Hz and the absence of a synchronised 1/f frequency spectrum. During these periods, spontaneously active neurons phase-locked to variable subsets of LFP oscillations. Individual neurons often ignored frequencies that others phase-locked to. We suggest that these desynchronised periods may correspond to REM sleep-like episodes occurring under anesthesia. Frequency selective codes may be used for signalling during these periods. Hence frequency-selective combination and frequency labelled pathways may represent a previously unsuspected dimension of cortical organisation. "
Neural networks for automatic scoring of arthritis disease activity on ultrasound images.,"Although retinoblastoma is rare but can be deadly in some severe cases. To find novel therapeutic targets for retinoblastoma, we explored the potential role of lncRNA NKILA in retinoblastoma. We found that, comparing to healthy controls, NKILA was downregulated, while lncRNA XIST was upregulated in plasma of retinoblastoma patients and they were inversely correlated. Downregulation of NKILA distinguished early stage patients from healthy controls. Overexpression of lncRNA NKILA mediated the downregulation of XIST in retinoblastoma cells, while XIST overexpression failed to significantly affect NKILA. Overexpression of NKILA resulted in decreased, while XIST overexpression resulted in increased proliferation, migration and invasion rates of retinoblastoma cells. In addition, rescue experiment showed that XIST overexpression attenuated the effects of NKILA overexpression on cancer cell behaviors. Therefore, NKILA inhibits retinoblastoma possibly by downregulating XIST, but the causality has not been fully validated. "
Recurrent prolapse of toric implantable collamer lens after blunt ocular trauma under mesopic conditions.,"To assess the effect of axial length (AL) on the quantification of superficial vessel density of both macular and disc region using swept source optical coherence tomography angiography (SSOCTA). This is a cross-sectional clinical study. Seventy-five eyes from 75 Chinese healthy participants (56 females) with a mean age of 26.66.8 (range 19-50) years were included in this study. All eyes were imaged with SSOCTA, using a 33mm scan pattern centered on the macular and optic disc respectively, and the superficial layer was used for evaluation. The image size was corrected with AL using Bennett formula. Outcome measurements included perfusion density (PD), vessel length density (VLD) in parafoveal and disc regions, averaged peripapillary large vessel diameter and area of foveal avascular zone (FAZ). Image processing and measurements was performed using Image J software. Multivariate regression analysis adjusting for age and signal strength was used to assess the influence of AL on the metrics. AL was the only predictive factor for parafoveal PD (=-0.273, P=0.047) and VLD (=-0.396, P=0.003). While there was no correlation between AL and area of FAZ, large vessel diameter, or the vessel density on any location in disc region. Age was the only predictor for PD (=-0.287, P=0.024) and VLD (=-0289, P=0.023) on optic nerve head. AL was negatively correlated with superficial parafoveal microvasculature, but not correlated with peripapillary capillaries, suggesting that the inner retina stretches more in the distal end of the disc with increased AL.

Spectrum of mutations in the <i>RB1</i> gene in Vietnamese patients with retinoblastoma.,"Endothelial dysfunction is one of the key risk factors in diabetes-related multi-organ damage. Methylglyoxal (MGO), a highly reactive dicarbonyl mainly generated as a by-product of glycolysis, is increased in both type 1 and type 2 diabetic patients. MGO can rapidly bind with proteins, nucleic acids and lipids, resulting in structural and functional changes of these targets and can form advanced glycation end products (AGEs). However, exactly how MGO causes endothelial cell dysfunction is not clear. Human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) from healthy (H-HAECs) and type 2 diabetic (D-HAECs) donors were cultured in endothelial growth media (EGM-2). D-HAECs demonstrated impaired tube formation (on Matrigel) and proliferation (MTT assay), as well as increased apoptosis (TUNEL staining), compared with H-HAECs. H-HAECs were treated with MGO (10M) for 24 hours with or without ATP-sensitive potassium channel (K<sub>ATP</sub>) channel antagonist glibenclamide (1M). MGO significantly impaired H-HAECs tube formation and proliferation and induced cell apoptosis which was reversed by glibenclamide. Meanwhile, activation of MAPK pathways p38 kinase, JNK, and ERK (determined by Western blot analyses of their phosphorylated forms, p-JNK, p-p38 and p-ERK) in D-HAECs were significantly enhanced compared with those in H-HAECs. MGO exposure enhanced the activation of all three MAPK pathways in H-HAECs, while glibenclamide reversed the activation of P-SAPK/JNK induced by MGO. Our data suggests MGO triggers endothelial cell dysfunction by activating JNK/P38 MAPK pathway, partly through activation of K<sub>ATP</sub> channel. Our study may provide useful information for developing MGO-targeted interventions to treat vascular disorders in diabetes. "
Seven novel variants expand the spectrum of <i>RPE65-</i>related Leber congenital amaurosis in the Chinese population.,"The Oxford Nanopore sequencing enables to directly detect methylation states of bases in DNA from reads without extra laboratory techniques. Novel computational methods are required to improve the accuracy and robustness of DNA methylation state prediction using Nanopore reads. In this study, we develop DeepSignal, a deep learning method to detect DNA methylation states from Nanopore sequencing reads. Testing on Nanopore reads of Homo sapiens (H. sapiens), Escherichia coli (E. coli) and pUC19 shows that DeepSignal can achieve higher performance at both read level and genome level on detecting 6mA and 5mC methylation states comparing to previous HMM based methods. DeepSignal achieves similar performance cross different DNA methylation bases, different DNA methylation motifs, and both singleton and mixed DNA CpG. Moreover, DeepSignal requires much lower coverage than those required by HMM and statistics based methods. DeepSignal can achieve 90% above accuracy for detecting 5mC and 6mA using only 2x coverage of reads. Furthermore, for DNA CpG methylation state prediction, DeepSignal achieves 90% correlation with bisulfite sequencing using just 20x coverage of reads, which is much better than HMM based methods. Especially, DeepSignal can predict methylation states of 5% more DNA CpGs that previously cannot be predicted by bisulfite sequencing. DeepSignal can be a robust and accurate method for detecting methylation states of DNA bases. DeepSignal is publicly available at https://github.com/bioinfomaticsCSU/deepsignal. Supplementary data are available at bioinformatics online. "
Differential stability of variant <i>OPN1LW</i> gene transcripts in myopic patients.,"To evaluate rod function longitudinally in intermediate age-related macular degeneration subjects with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD) and without RPD (AMD). Retinal sensitivities (505 and 625 nm) during dark adaptation, at 14 locations within the central 12 macula were obtained after photobleaching at baseline and 12-month visits. Pointwise sensitivity differences between both stimuli were used to assess static rod function, while rod intercept time (RIT) and rod recovery rate (RRR) were used to evaluate dynamic function. Changes in function over time were compared between groups. A total of 23 controls, 12 AMD, and 13 RPD cases were followed-up. At baseline, the RPD group had significantly worst static and dynamic rod function compared to AMD and control groups. Static function in AMD was similar to controls. Static and dynamic function across the central 12 was consistent in controls; however, it was most impaired at 4 compared to 12 eccentricity in disease groups. Over 12 months, no AMD cases progressed clinically and static function in AMD improved (P  0.04), but remained unchanged in control and RPD groups (P  0.17). The RRR for control and RPD groups remained stable, while the AMD group deteriorated, but only at 12 (P = 0.02). The RIT was stable in AMD (P = 0.75) and RPD (P = 0.71) groups but improved in the control group (P = 0.002). A decrease in RRR was detected over 12 months at 12 eccentricity in the AMD group. Evaluating changes in rod function requires testing at multiple locations including the peripheral macula. "
Screening of CRISPR/Cas base editors to target the AMD high-risk Y402H complement factor H variant.,"Keratoconus (KTCN) is a complex eye disorder resulting in loss of visual function. Its development is affected by genetic and environmental components. The aim of this study was to unravel the role of epigenetic factors in KTCN. To verify if DNA methylation may play a role in KTCN development, reduced representation bisulfite sequencing of five KTCN and five non-KTCN human corneas was performed. Multiple KTCN-specific differentially methylated regions were detected and many of them overlap previously identified KTCN linkage loci (3p14.3, 5q35.2, 13q32.3, 15q24.1, and 20p13) and chromosome arms that have been linked to KTCN (2q, 4q, 5p, 9p, 14q, and 17q). Reanalysis of the previously described RNA sequencing dataset of 25 KTCN and 25 non-KTCN human corneas revealed that 12 genes downregulated in KTCN and 6 upregulated genes overlapped or were located in the near vicinity of the identified differentially methylated regions. Particularly interesting were the DNA methylation changes in WNT3 and WNT5A encoding Wnt ligands, as they provide a potential explanation for the Wnt signaling pathway dysregulation observed in KTCN. We presented the results of data analysis from the first study of DNA methylation changes in human KTCN corneas compared to non-KTCN samples. We were able to identify genomic regions with distinct patterns of DNA hypo- and hypermethylation and link them to previously found KTCN susceptibility loci as well as transcriptomic disruption of Wnt signaling pathway observed in KTCN.

Tyrosinase (TYR) gene sequencing and literature review reveals recurrent mutations and multiple population founder gene mutations as causative of oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) in Pakistani families.,"Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is a multifaceted cytokine that functions in both angiogenesis and inflammation. A proangiogenic state has been found in adults with sickle cell disease (SCD), mainly because of elevated Ang-2 levels. We determined Ang-2 level in 40 children and adolescents with SCD compared with 40 healthy controls and assessed its relation to retinopathy as well as carotid intimamedia thickness (CIMT). Hematological profile, serum ferritin, and serum Ang-2 were measured. CIMT was assessed using high-resolution ultrasound. Fundus examination was performed followed by fundus fluorescein angiography. Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) was used to find small vascular changes not clinically manifested. Ang-2 levels and CIMT were significantly higher in SCD patients compared with controls. The incidence of nonproliferative retinopathy was 45%. SCD patients with retinopathy were older in age with a history of sickling crisis of >3 attacks per year and had a higher incidence of sickle cell anemia than sickle -thalassemia. Ang-2 cutoff value 9000pg/mL could significantly detect the presence of retinopathy among SCD patients with 100% sensitivity and specificity. Serum Ang-2 levels were positively correlated with HbS and CIMT. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Ang-2 and HbS significantly contribute to retinopathy among patients with SCD. Elevated Ang-2 highlights the role of angiogenesis in the pathophysiology of SCD and may be considered a promising marker for screening of patients at risk of sickle retinopathy and vascular dysfunction.

"Visual Function Questionnaire as an outcome measure for homonymous hemianopia: subscales and supplementary questions, analysis from the VISION trial.","Phacomatosis pigmentovascularis has previously almost exclusively been reported in Asians and in dermatological journals. In this report, we present a case of a young black South African male referred to our eye clinic. A 15-year-old male patient presented with gradual, painless loss of vision in his right eye. Clinical examination revealed a port wine stain with ocular involvement on the right as well as a nevus of Ota. Fundoscopy on the right revealed an advanced glaucomatous optic disc and raised intra-ocular pressure. A diagnosis of glaucoma associated with phacomatosis pigmentovascularis was made. We present the first case of phacomatosis pigmentovascularis in an African male with associated glaucoma seen at our tertiary hospital. "

A glycopolymer improves vascoelasticity and mucociliary transport of abnormal cystic fibrosis mucus.,"To evaluate the long-term outcome of active choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in punctate inner choroidopathy (PIC) or multifocal choroiditis (MFC) after intravitreal bevacizumab treatment. Retrospective study of consecutive patients of PIC/MFC complicated with active CNV. Outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), total number of intravitreal injections of bevacizumab and recurrence of CNV. Correlation analysis was performed to find the correlation of various clinical factors and final BCVA. There were 23 eyes in 22 patients with a mean age of 33.22years included in this study. The mean duration of follow-up was 6.48years. Improvement of BCVA was noted through the first 3 years and at the final follow-up. BCVA at 1, 6, 12months and recurrence of CNV were correlated with final BCVA. Most patients of PIC/MFC complicated with CNV managed with intravitreal bevacizumab had improved BCVA over 4 years. "
"The CCCTC binding factor, CTRL2, modulates heterochromatin deposition and the establishment of HSV-1 latency <i>in vivo</i>.","To investigate the relation between high axial myopia and neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR) values. Seventy-nine cases were enrolled, 50 myopic and 29 emmetropic. All participants were assigned into three groups: Group I (high myopia with no retinal involvement), Group II (high myopia with retinal involvement) and Group III (control). NLR and PLR values calculated from blood tests were compared among the groups. Mean NLR levels were 2.230.78 in Group I, 2.361.06 in Group II, and 1.570.33 in Group III. Mean PLR levels were 114.6223.21 in Group I, 145.1652.36 in Group II, and 91.4218.73 in Group III. NLR and PLR values in the high myopia groups were significantly higher than in the control group. NLR and PLR values in cases with high axial myopia were higher than in the emmetropic group. Higher inflammation in the degenerative myopic group in particular may be related to pathological chorioretinal changes. "
Erenumab in chronic migraine with medication overuse: Subgroup analysis of a randomized trial.,"To describe the process of establishing a selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT) service delivered by experienced allied health professionals (AHP) in a Scottish NHS Hospital Eye Service, and assess the safety and efficacy in comparison with SLT performed by ophthalmologists. A training scheme for AHPs who were experienced in extended roles within the glaucoma service was developed, consisting of supervised training by a consultant ophthalmologist specialising in glaucoma leading to the AHPs independently delivering SLT. A prospective audit of consecutive SLT procedures performed by AHPs between November 2015 and April 2017 was performed. Data were analysed and compared to a previous intradepartmental audit of SLT performed by ophthalmologists (consultants and trainees). A total of 325 eyes of 208 patients underwent SLT, of which 117 patients had bilateral SLT in a single session. The overall rate of complications was 3.9%, however these were minor and/or self-limiting (this compared to a 3.8% complication rate in the ophthalmologist delivered SLT series). The rate of intraocular pressure (IOP) spike was 0.3%, compared to 1.4% in the ophthalmologist delivered SLT series. Mean IOP at listing was 20.95.1mmHg, 17.34.5mmHg at 3months post SLT and 17.63.7mmHg at 12months-a median reduction of 16.7% at 3months and 17.4% at 12months. There was no statistically significant difference between the percentage reduction in IOP in the AHP and ophthalmologist delivered SLT groups at 3 or 12months. This is the first service of its kind in Scotland and the outcomes of this study demonstrate that the AHP delivered SLT service is at least as safe as the previous ophthalmologist delivered SLT service. The data demonstrate a similar efficacy between AHP and ophthalmologist delivered SLT. In the face of increasing demand and workload, this is a practical model in service commissioning to free up medical clinicians for more complex glaucoma management. "
Case of paediatric steroid-induced glaucoma showing extremely fast progression with deformation of lamina cribrosa.,"To study the corneal and internal astigmatism and the age-related changes underlying the known refractive shift with-the-rule (WTR) towards against-the-rule (ATR) astigmatism. Refractive and corneal biometry data were collected for a total of 1195 healthy Caucasian subjects, recruited by ophthalmological centres across Europe. After conversion of refractive and corneal surface astigmatism to power vectors J<sub>0</sub> and J<sub>45</sub> , the total corneal and internal astigmatism were calculated. Both refractive power vectors had leptokurtic distributions with a narrow peak at zero, and a broader, secondary distribution at its base, corresponding to eyes without balanced components. This may be fitted with a bigaussian function (J<sub>0</sub> : r=0.87; J<sub>45</sub> : r=0.98). Statistically significant changes in these distributions are seen with age: for refractive J<sub>0</sub> the narrow peak shortens progressively, while the broad peak shifts positive from to negative values, corresponding to increased astigmatism and a shift from with-the-rule towards against-the-rule. For J<sub>45</sub> the narrow peak shortens with age as well, while the broad peak flattens. These changes in refractive J<sub>0</sub> result from statistically significant negative shifts in both the corneal and internal components with age (Kruskal-Wallis, p<0.05). In young participants corneal and internal astigmatism partially cancel each other out. This balance between both is gradually lost after age 50, leading to larger amounts of refractive astigmatism, as well as a reorientation of the axis. Given the small amplitude of these changes, they are unlikely to have repercussions for long term stability toric cataract or refractive surgery outcomes. "
Shear-induced alignment of collagen fibrils using 3D cell printing for corneal stroma tissue engineering.,"Pars plana vitrectomy is currently the most common technique used in retinal surgery. Although primarily involving the posterior segment of the eye it also affects the anterior segment. As this is a less published topic, the aim of this paper was to review the literature on changes in the anterior segment after uncomplicated pars plana vitrectomy using data based literature search. The conclusions are that even in otherwise ophthalmologically healthy patients, complications may occur in the anterior segment. Surgeons need to pay utmost attention in glaucoma patients and in those with endothelial insufficiency who are at highest risk of complications. He/she must also correctly plan a potential cataract surgery if not already done earlier. From the literature, most of the changes in the anterior segment after uncomplicated PPV are found to be temporary. "
Essential Roles of Tbr1 in the Formation and Maintenance of the Orientation-Selective J-RGCs and a Group of OFF-Sustained RGCs in Mouse.,"Survival in metastasized cutaneous melanoma (CM) has been improved with the advent of inhibitors of immune checkpoints CTLA4 and PD-1. In contrast, the response rate for inhibition of these checkpoints in uveal melanoma (UM) is very low. Other checkpoints including IDO and TIGIT may be targetable. Sections from 6 patients with UM, who had undergone primary enucleation 1978-1995 and 6 paired liver metastases were stained immunohistochemically (SOX10, Melan-A, IDO, TIGIT, and CD8). Four tumors from patients who did not develop metastasis during a mean follow-up of 19years, and 5 samples each of normal choroidal and liver tissue were included for comparison. The number of cells/mm<sup>2</sup> expressing IDO, TIGIT and CD8 was counted with manual and digital image analysis methods. Retrospective data on patient and tumor characteristics was reviewed. The number of TIGIT positive cells was significantly higher in primary tumors from patients whoeventually developed metastases (mean 4695cells/mm<sup>2</sup> ) than from patients who didn't (mean 1342cells/mm<sup>2</sup> , P<0.01) and paired metastases (463cells/mm<sup>2</sup> , P<0.01). The number of IDO positive cells was not significantly higher in metastatic tumors (P=0.079), but the number of IDO and TIGIT positive cells/mm<sup>2</sup> correlated in both hot spots (R<sup>2</sup> =0.24, P<0.01) and full tumor sections (R<sup>2</sup> =0.35, P<0.01). The expression of immune checkpoint receptor TIGIT is increased in primary uveal melanomas that seed metastases, and correlates with the expression of checkpoint receptor IDO. Both may be future targets for therapy. "
Restoring retinal neurovascular health via substance P.,"The organization of extraocular muscles and their motor nuclei was investigated in the mouse due to the increased importance of this model for oculomotor research. Mice showed a standard extraocular muscle organization pattern, although their eyes are set at the side of the head. They do have more prominent oblique muscles, whose insertion points differ from those of frontal-eyed species. Retrograde tracers revealed that the motoneuron layout aligns with the general vertebrate plan with respect to nuclei and laterality. The mouse departed in some significant respects from previously studied species. First, more overlap between the distributions of muscle-specific motoneuronal pools was present in the oculomotor nucleus. Furthermore, motoneuron dendrites for each pool filled the entire oculomotor nucleus and extended beyond the edge of the abducens nucleus. This suggests mouse extraocular motoneuron afferents must target specific pools based on features other than dendritic distribution and nuclear borders. Second, abducens internuclear neurons are located outside the abducens nucleus. We concluded this because no unlabeled abducens internuclear neurons were observed following lateral rectus muscle injections and because retrograde tracer injections into the oculomotor nucleus labeled cells immediately ventral and ventrolateral to the abducens nucleus, not within it. This may provide an anatomical substrate for differential input to motoneurons and internuclear neurons that allows rodents to move their eyes more independently. Finally, while soma size measurements suggested motoneuron subpopulations supplying multiply- and singly-innervated muscle fibers are present, markers for neurofilaments and perineuronal nets indicated overlap in the size distributions of the two populations.

Cone-Mediated Function Correlates to Altered Foveal Morphology in Preterm-Born Children at School Age.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) represents an aggressive malignancy in the eye during the period of infancy and childhood. We delineated the ability of microRNA-186 (miR-186) to influence viability, invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and apoptosis of RB via the Hedgehog signaling pathway by targeting AAA domain-containing protein 2 (ATAD2). The microarray-based analysis was adopted to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to RB. Subsequently, RB cells were treated with miR-186 mimic, miR-186 inhibitor, or si-ATAD2. The expression of miR-186, ATAD2, Hedgehog signaling pathway-related genes were evaluated, and the target relationship between miR-186 and ATAD2 was verified. Finally, cell proliferation, invasion, migration, apoptosis, and angiogenesis were assessed. ATAD2 was identified as a DEG and modulated by miR-186. Moreover, we revealed that ATAD2 was highly expressed, whereas miR-186 was lowly expressed, and the Hedgehog signaling pathway was activated in RB. Then, ATAD2 as a putative target of miR-186 was validated using a luciferase assay. miR-186 mimic or siRNA-ATAD2 in RB cells reduced cell viability, invasion, and migration coordinating with elevated apoptosis via impairing the Hedgehog signaling pathway, where repressed angiogenesis was observed. Overexpression of miR-186 attenuates RB via the inactivation of the Hedgehog signaling pathway by downregulating ATAD2. "
Enhancing Retinal Endothelial Glycolysis by Inhibiting UCP2 Promotes Physiologic Retinal Vascular Development in a Model of Retinopathy of Prematurity.,"Childhood onset neurofibromatosis type 2 can be severe and genotype dependent. We present a retrospective phenotypic analysis of all ascertained children in England <age 18 (N=87;male 61%). Mean age at last review was 13.9 years with mean follow-up 6.5 years. Patients were stratified using a validated score (1A/1B:no NF2 pathogenic_variant in blood; 2A/2B:mild/moderate NF2 constitutional or mosaic pathogenic_variant in blood; 3:constitutional truncating exon 2-13 pathogenic_variant. 91% patients had a constitutional NF2 pathogenic_variant (44% de novo). Mean age at first manifestation was 4.3 and 8.8 years in groups 3 and 2A respectively. Bilateral vestibular schwannoma, intracranial meningioma and spinal schwannoma occurred in 77%, 52% and 65% of group 3 patients respectively, and 58%, 26% and 33% in 2A. 43% group 3 and 18% 2A had severe unilateral visual loss (logmar>1.0). Focal cortical dysplasia occurred in 26% group 3 and 4% 2A. 48% of group 3 underwent 1 major intervention (intracranial/spinal surgery/Bevacizumab/radiotherapy) compared to 35% of 2A; with 23% group 3 undergoing spinal surgery (schwannoma/ependymoma/meningioma resection) compared to 4% of 2A. Mean age starting Bevacizumab was 12.7 in group 3 and 14.9 years in 2A. In conclusion, group 3 phenotype manifests earlier with greater tumour load, poorer visual outcomes and more intervention. "
Characteristics of Diabetic Capillary Nonperfusion in Macular and Extramacular White Spots on Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,"Retinal ganglion cell (RGC) apoptosis is considered an important pathological hallmark of glaucoma. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a pleiotropic peptide with potent neuroprotective properties. In our previous study, we found that the expression of PACAP and its high-affinity receptor PACAP receptor type 1 (PAC1R) increased markedly after optic nerve crush (ONC), and occurred mainly in the ganglion cell layer of the retina. This suggests that the upregulation of PACAP may play a vital role in inhibiting RGC death after ONC. Therefore, in the present study, we investigate the specific effects and underlying mechanism of PACAP in RGC death after ONC. Vehicle (physiological saline) or PACAP (1nM to 200nM) solution was injected into the vitreous body. Seven days later, the retinas were harvested, and the surviving RGCs were retrogradely labeled with Fluoro-Gold (FG; Fluorochrome) at different concentrations of PACAP. Immunofluorescence double staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay were used to observe the effects of PACAP on RGC apoptosis. Our results showed that PACAP treatment inhibited caspase-3-mediated RGC apoptosis, promoted the phosphorylation of cAMP response element binding protein (CREB), up-regulated the expression of B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), and ultimately improved RGC survival. These results suggest that PACAP may prevent RGC apoptosis after ONC via activation of CREB-mediated Bcl-2 transcription. The study thus contributes to a basic understanding of the mechanism by which PACAP decreased RGC apoptosis and provides a theoretical basis for future clinical application of PACAP in the treatment of glaucoma.

Retinal Layer Thicknesses in Early Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Results From the German AugUR Study.,"The purpose of this paper is to provide an in-depth understanding of how to best utilize 3D printing in medicine, and more particularly in ophthalmology in order to enhance the clinicians' ability to provide out-of-the-box solutions for unusual challenges that require patient personalization. In this review, we discuss the main applications of 3D printing for diseases of the anterior and posterior segments of the eye and discuss their current status and implementation. We aim to raise awareness among ophthalmologists and report current and future developments. A computerized search from inception up to 2018 of the online electronic database PubMed was performed, using the following search strings: ""3D,"" ""printing,"" ""ophthalmology,"" and ""bioprinting."" Additional data was extracted from relevant websites. The reference list in each relevant article was analyzed for additional relevant publications. 3D printing first appeared three decades ago. Nevertheless, the implementation and utilization of this technology in healthcare became prominent only in the last 5years. 3D printing applications in ophthalmology are vast, including organ fabrication, medical devices, production of customized prosthetics, patient-tailored implants, and production of anatomical models for surgical planning and educational purposes. The potential applications of 3D printing in ophthalmology are extensive. 3D printing enables cost-effective design and production of instruments that aid in early detection of common ocular conditions, diagnostic and therapeutic devices built specifically for individual patients, 3D-printed contact lenses and intraocular implants, models that assist in surgery planning and improve patient and medical staff education, and more. Advances in bioprinting appears to be the future of 3D printing in healthcare in general, and in ophthalmology in particular, with the emerging possibility of printing viable tissues and ultimately the creation of a functioning cornea, and later retina. It is expected that the various applications of 3D printing in ophthalmology will become part of mainstream medicine. "
Investigations on the Role of the Fibrinolytic Pathway on Outflow Facility Regulation.,"We report a rare case of rapid transformation of a conjunctival keratoacanthoma (KA) into a highly aggressive squamous cell carcinoma requiring enucleation. To our knowledge, this is the second such case reported in the literature. Case report. A 73-year-old man presented with a recurrent conjunctival lesion in the right eye. A slit lamp examination revealed a hyperkeratotic lesion in the limbar conjunctiva adhered to deep planes but with no ocular involvement. An incisional biopsy was performed because an area of scleromalacia was observed underlying the lesion. Histological findings were consistent with conjunctival KA. One week later, a raised lesion was observed invading the anterior chamber. Histological examination of another excisional biopsy specimen indicated conjunctival squamous cell carcinoma. The right eye was enucleated. Histological analysis confirmed intraocular tumor invasion. Complete clinical remission was observed over one year of follow up. Although conjunctival keratoacanthoma is normally benign, it is important to correctly differentiate between KA and squamous cell carcinoma, and closely monitor the eye after surgery because of the rare possibility of recurrence or conversion to squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistochemistry could help in the diagnosis and management of dubious cases. "
Outer Retinal Oxidative Stress Measured In Vivo Using QUEnch-assiSTed (QUEST) OCT.,"Gout is a common arthritis caused by elevated serum uric acid (SUA) levels. Here we investigated loci influencing SUA in a genome-wide meta-analysis with 121,745 Japanese subjects. We identified 8948 variants at 36 genomic loci (<i>P</i><510<sup>-8</sup>) including eight novel loci. Of these, missense variants of <i>SESN2</i> and <i>PNPLA3</i> were predicted to be damaging to the function of these proteins; another five loci-<i>TMEM18</i>, <i>TM4SF4</i>, <i>MXD3-LMAN2</i>, <i>PSORS1C1-PSORS1C2</i>, and <i>HNF4A</i>-are related to cell metabolism, proliferation, or oxidative stress; and the remaining locus, <i>LINC01578</i>, is unknown. We also identified 132 correlated genes whose expression levels are associated with SUA-increasing alleles. These genes are enriched for the UniProt transport term, suggesting the importance of transport-related genes in SUA regulation. Furthermore, trans-ethnic meta-analysis across our own meta-analysis and the Global Urate Genetics Consortium has revealed 15 more novel loci associated with SUA. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenesis, treatment, and prevention of hyperuricemia/gout. "
Commentary on: Rehabilitation of the Dysmorphic Lower Eyelid From Hyaluronic Acid Filler: What to Do After a Good Periocular Treatment Goes Bad.,"The aim was to determine the relationship between bulbar conjunctival microcirculation and retinal microcirculation in a healthy population. A functional slit-lamp biomicroscope (FSLB) was used to measure blood flow velocity (BFV) and blood flow rate (BFR) in the conjunctiva while a retinal function imager (RFI) was used to measure macular BFV and BFR in the retina. One eye of each subject of 58 self-reported healthy subjects was imaged in the same session on the same day. The mean BFV in the venules of the conjunctiva was 0.490.13mm/s, which was significantly slower than that in the retinal arterioles (3.710.78mm/s, <i>P</i><0.001) and retinal venules (2.980.58mm/s, <i>P</i><0.001). The BFR in the conjunctiva (0.09nl/s) was also significantly lower than that in the retina (arterioles=0.81nl/s, venules=0.68nl/s, all <i>P</i><0.001). The BFVs and BFRs were not related between the conjunctiva and retina (r ranged from -0.17 to -0.05, all <i>P</i>>0.05). The microcirculation in the retina appeared to be different from that in the conjunctiva. "
ON-Type Retinal Ganglion Cells are Preferentially Affected in STZ-Induced Diabetic Mice.,"The purpose of this manuscript was to provide a better understanding of patients with intralenticular foreign bodies (FBs) and also to review the reported cases, including clinical presentation, diagnosis, management, and visual outcome. A 50-year-old male was referred to our clinic with suspected intraocular FB. Under slit-lamp examination, a full-thickness corneal wound with localized corneal edema at the temporal lower peri-limbal area was revealed. Seidel test did not indicate any wound leakage. The corresponding iris was depigmented, but there was no penetrating hole. The anterior chamber was deep with cells, but the lens, vitreous, and fundus were normal. B-scan ultrasonography and orbital computed tomography were performed, but no intraocular FB was detected. On the 2<sup>nd</sup> day, a zonal cortical cataract and posterior subcapsular cataract formed rapidly. Left-eye bare vision dramatically decreased from 20/100 to counting fingers. One month later, the patient received elective extracapsular cataract extraction. A fine metal thread was completely embedded in the lens; the lens and FB were removed together during the operation. The posterior capsule was not injured; an intraocular lens was implanted in the capsular bag. Two months postoperatively, left-eye vision had returned to 20/25. No adverse events were noted during the follow-up period. In addition to the case report, some 28 previously reported cases of intralenticular FB are reviewed here. Patient demographics, time and course of management, and visual outcome are all summarized and compared. "
The Role of Schlemm's Canal Endothelium Cellular Connectivity in Giant Vacuole Formation: A 3D Electron Microscopy Study.,"An 86-year-old Asian man with asteroid hyalosis presented with decreased vision in the left eye. He underwent phacoemulsification and implantation of silicone intraocular lens (IOL) in the left eye 18 years ago, and also received neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser 3 years ago. At presentation, his corrected visual acuity (CVA) was 20/1000 in the left eye. Slit-lamp examination showed white-gray membranous deposits on the posterior IOL surface. The deposits were removed using Nd:YAG laser treatment. One week later, his CVA improved to 20/30, and opacity of the posterior IOL surface was removed. Six months later, his CVA was 20/30, and visual axis was clear. This case suggests that Nd:YAG laser treatment can be a viable option in some patients with posterior surface opacification of silicone IOL associated with asteroid hyalosis, especially in those who are a poor candidate for IOL exchange due to old age or compromised general condition.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography in Mice: Quantitative Analysis After Experimental Models of Retinal Damage.,"Traditional hydrodissection may cause posterior capsule rupture (PCR) if excessive fluid accumulates. In this study, we describe the successful application of a novel minimal fluid hydrodissection technique in 100 consecutive cataract surgery cases. This technique separates the nucleus from the capsule utilizing low hydrostatic pressure and precise kinetic movement of a small volume (around 0.2 cc) of balanced salt solution. There were no instances of PCR. This technique is suitable for a range of cases, including femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery and posterior subcapsular cataract. "
Longitudinal evaluation of visual function and structure for detection of subclinical Ethambutol-induced optic neuropathy.,"The purpose of this study is to compare the contrast sensitivity function (CSF) between eyes of age-matched individuals with aspheric intraocular lens (IOL) and emmetropia. A prospective hospital-based case-control study in South India was conducted to study the CSF in the eyes of patients between the ages of 50-60 years. The CSF was compared between those with emmetropia and those implanted with an indigenous aspheric IOL. Twenty-five consecutive patients were recruited in both groups. The independent sample <i>t</i>-test was used for analysis. The mean age was 53.08  1.96 years and 57.68  2.85 years in normal emmetropes and emmetropic pseudophakic with aspheric IOL, respectively. The mean CSF showed a statistically significant difference (<i>P</i> < 0.000) between the normal emmetropic eyes and pseudophakic eyes with the values being 1.91 and 1.572, respectively. The CSF was significantly better in the eyes of age-matched normal emmetropes when compared to those with an aspheric IOL implanted. "
Color visual acuity in preperimetric glaucoma and open-angle glaucoma.,"The purpose of the study is to develop a novel nomogram and validate with a retrospective comparative study for manual astigmatic keratotomy (MAK) with the assistance of intraoperative aberrometry (Optiwave Refractive Analysis [ORA]) and digital eye tracking (VERION) in mild astigmatic correction enhancement. The study was conducted in Honolulu, Hawaii. This was a single-surgeon comparative study with retrospective data collection. Sixty consecutive adult cataract surgery cases with regular astigmatism of 1.25 D or less were included for study from April 2016 to April 2017. VERION was used preoperatively in all cases. MAK was performed before phacoemulsification according to the surgeon's own nomogram. ORA then was utilized to obtain the axis and remaining cylinder power after phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implant implantation. MAK extension was performed for eyes with 1 D or more of remaining cylinder. Extensions were carried out slowly and slightly until the amount of cylinder was 1 D or less under ORA. The mean degrees of extension plus the original MAK plan were calculated to develop the new nomogram. Sixty consecutive similar cases by the same surgeon using the surgeon's nomogram without using ORA/VERION for enhancement were reviewed from April 2015 to April 2016 for comparison. All patients included in this study signed the consent form. Using Alpins vector analysis for comparison, the proportion of patients with cylinder <0.5 D 3 months postoperatively was 87% in the ORA/VERION group compared to 70% in the non-ORA/VERION group (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Better than 20/25 best-corrected visual acuity was achieved more in the ORA/VERION group compared to non-ORA/VERION group. This novel nomogram developed by the surgeon may have better outcomes than the old surgeon's own nomogram. Further prospective control study is needed to validate the efficacy. If validated, those surgeons who do not have ORA/VERION can hopefully use this nomogram with greater success. "
Repeatability of brown adipose tissue measurements on FDG PET/CT following a simple cooling procedure for BAT activation.,"With the success of Descemet's stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK) technique providing better outcomes in visual prognosis and theoretically lower rejection rate than penetrating keratoplasty, DSAEK dominated the realm of endothelial keratoplasty for the past decade. However, Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) has become more and more popular worldwide due to its even lower rejection rate, faster visual recovery, better visual outcome, and lower long-term endothelial loss. In this article, we demonstrate the techniques and nuances of DMEK surgery in detail for corneal specialists who are beginning their DMEK surgeries. "
Fovea Plana in a 9-Year-Old Boy Presenting with Decreased Vision in the Left Eye.,"The continued development of intraocular lens (IOL) technology has led to a dramatic improvement in refractive outcomes. New and innovative ways of achieving the desired postoperative refractive goals continue to be developed. This article aims to review the currently available IOL modalities for correction of presbyopia at the time of cataract surgery, including reference to high-quality comparative studies, where available, and discussion of strengths as well as limitations of the currently available IOL technologies. It has been shown that multifocal compared to monofocal IOL was associated with higher rates of spectacle independence, but higher rates and severity of symptomatic glare as well as reduced contrast sensitivity. Within multifocal IOLs, diffractive compared to refractive IOLs tended to have better near vision and a lower rate of symptomatic glare. Extended depth-of-focus IOLs compared to diffractive multifocal IOL demonstrated equal or superior intermediate visual acuity, with less than or equal rates of glare. Accommodative IOLs represent a broad range of technologies that continue to develop, and new technologies offering opportunities for postoperative adjustment of refractive outcome are emerging. "
Visual cortex neurons phase-lock selectively to subsets of LFP oscillations.,"A systematic literature search was conducted to identify and review studies comparing SF<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> as a tamponade agent in the intraoperative management of macular holes. Publications up to October 2018 that focused on macular hole surgery in terms of primary closure, complications, and clinical outcomes were included. Forest plots were created using a weighted summary of proportion meta-analysis. Analysis was performed separately for SF<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>. A random effects model was used, and corresponding <i>I</i><sup>2</sup> heterogeneity estimates were calculated. Nine pertinent publications studying a total of 4,715 patients were identified in 2000 to 2017, including two randomized studies (<i>n</i>=206), two prospective studies (<i>n</i>=170), and five retrospective or registry-based studies. Similar rates of closure between SF<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> were reported in eight out of nine studies, regardless of subgroup analyses. All studies reporting visual outcomes showed similar results when comparing SF<sub>6</sub> to C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> at one to six months of follow-up. Neither agent was clearly associated with increased risk of ocular hypertension, cataract formation, or other adverse events. Meta-analytic pooling of the closure rates in the SF<sub>6</sub> group resulted in 91.73% (95% confidence interval: 88.40 to 94.55, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>: 38.03%), and for C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>, the closure rate was 88.36% (95% confidence interval: 85.88 to 90.63, <i>I</i><sup>2</sup>: 0.0%). Both SF<sub>6</sub> and C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> appear to have achieved similar visual outcomes and primary closure rates and neither was associated with an increased risk of adverse events. Considering the more rapid visual recovery with SF<sub>6</sub>, there appears to be no evidence to support C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub> as the tamponade agent of choice for macular hole surgery. "
LncRNA NKILA inhibits retinoblastoma by downregulating lncRNA XIST.,"We analyzed two siblings in a Japanese family with delayed onset cone-rod dystrophy (CRD) using whole-exome sequencing. A novel frameshift c.1106dup (p.H370Afs*17) variant and a known missense c.2027T>A (p.I676N) variant in <i>CDHR1</i> were identified. Both patients shared the same variants, although they displayed a significant difference in disease severity. A meta-analysis of the relationship between the severity and the variant type was performed using the reported cases in the literature and did not reveal a definitive correlation. "
Influence of Axial Length on Parafoveal and Peripapillary Metrics from Swept Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography.,"This study measured longitudinal changes in dry eye disease (DED) symptoms and signs following lifitegrast therapy and assessed their relationship to tear osmolarity to test the hypothesis that a decline in tear osmolarity is a reliable leading indicator of subsequent improvement in DED symptoms and signs after initiating lifitegrast treatment. This phase IV, prospective, single-arm, open-label, 12-week study enrolled subjects aged 18 years with eye dryness score 40 (0-100 VAS) and tear osmolarity 308 mOsm/L. Subjects were prescribed lifitegrast ophthalmic solution 5%, twice daily in each eye. DED symptoms were assessed via VAS at baseline and 2, 6, and 12 weeks. Signs included tear osmolarity, meibomian gland dysfunction, tear breakup time, and fluorescein corneal staining. In post-hoc analysis, subjects with 5 mOsm/L decrease in osmolarity over 12 weeks were Responders. Of 26 subjects in the intent-to-treat population, 23 were female; mean age was 67.4 years. Baseline meanSD eye dryness was 68.716.5 and tear osmolarity was 317.88.5 mOsm/L. All seven symptoms (dryness, burning, foreign body sensation, pain, photophobia, itching, blurred vision) declined significantly (<i>P</i><0.01) from baseline to 6 and 12 weeks. Signs did not change significantly. For 13 Responders, tear osmolarity decreased from baseline to 12 weeks (319.28.5 to 300.612.3 mOsm/L, <i>P</i><0.001) and corneal staining trended toward improvement (1.10.9 to 0.60.7, <i>P</i>=0.136). Among Nonresponders, osmolarity increased from 316.4+8.7 to 329.6+13.9 (<i>P</i><0.01) and corneal staining showed no change (1.30.8 to 1.00.7 at 12 weeks, <i>P</i>=0.293). Lifitegrast reduced DED symptoms among subjects with moderate-to-severe disease (severity defined by VAS for eye dryness). Potential reasons that may underlie the dichotomous effect of drug treatment on tear osmolarity are discussed. "
Methylglyoxal Triggers Human Aortic Endothelial Cell Dysfunction via Modulating K<sub>ATP</sub>/MAPK pathway.,"Efforts to scale neuroimaging towards the direct visualization of mammalian brain-wide neuronal activity have faced major challenges. Although high-resolution optical imaging of the whole brain in small animals has been achieved ex vivo, the real-time and direct monitoring of large-scale neuronal activity remains difficult, owing to the performance gap between localized, largely invasive, optical microscopy of rapid, cellular-resolved neuronal activity and whole-brain macroscopy of slow haemodynamics and metabolism. Here, we demonstrate both ex vivo and non-invasive in vivo functional optoacoustic (OA) neuroimaging of mice expressing the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6f. The approach offers rapid, high-resolution three-dimensional snapshots of whole-brain neuronal activity maps using single OA excitations, and of stimulus-evoked slow haemodynamics and fast calcium activity in the presence of strong haemoglobin background absorption. By providing direct neuroimaging at depths and spatiotemporal resolutions superior to optical fluorescence imaging, functional OA neuroimaging bridges the gap between functional microscopy and whole-brain macroscopy. "
DeepSignal: detecting DNA methylation state from Nanopore sequencing reads using deep-learning.,"The purpose of this article is to compare optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) in patients with central serous chorioretinopathy (CSC). OCTA, ICGA and fluorescein angiography (FA) images of all enrolled patients were collected and compared. Abnormal areas were annotated on en face choriocapillaris OCTA and ICGA images and compared with each other. We found three main types of anomalies in choriocapillaris OCTA images: type A, coarse granulated high reflective area (61 eyes [92.4%]); type B, roundish dark halo around Type A (54 eyes [81.8%]); and type C, coarse granulated low reflective area (66 eyes [100%]). There were 54 eyes (81.8%) that exhibited all three types abnormalities, 7 (10.6%) had only type A and C abnormalities, and 5 (7.6%) had only type C abnormalities. The Mean JI of type A on OCTA and hyperfluorescence area on ICGA was 0.840.15 and 0.820.23 for grader 1 and 2, respectively. Type A area on OCTA had a statistically larger area than hyperfluorescence on ICGA (P=0.01 [paired t-test]). In summary, abnormalities were found on OCTA images of CSC. Coarse granulated high reflective area in OCTA corresponded well with the hyper-permeability area in ICGA in most of the eyes. "
Longitudinal Assessment of Rod Function in Intermediate Age-Related Macular Degeneration With and Without Reticular Pseudodrusen.,"Currently, the two primary patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models of glioblastoma are established through intracranial or subcutaneous injection. In this study, a novel PDX model of glioblastoma was developed via intravitreal injection to facilitate tumor formation in a brain-mimicking microenvironment with improved visibility and fast development. Glioblastoma cells were prepared from the primary and recurrent tumor tissues of a 39-year-old female patient. To demonstrate the feasibility of intracranial tumor formation, U-87 MG and patient-derived glioblastoma cells were injected into the brain parenchyma of Balb/c nude mice. Unlike the U-87 MG cells, the patient-derived glioblastoma cells failed to form intracranial tumors until 6 weeks after tumor cell injection. In contrast, the patient-derived cells effectively formed intraocular tumors, progressing from plaques at 2 weeks to masses at 4 weeks after intravitreal injection. The in vivo tumors exhibited the same immunopositivity for human mitochondria, GFAP, vimentin, and nestin as the original tumors in the patient. Furthermore, cells isolated from the in vivo tumors also demonstrated morphology similar to that of their parental cells and immunopositivity for the same markers. Overall, a novel PDX model of glioblastoma was established via the intravitreal injection of tumor cells. This model will be an essential tool to investigate and develop novel therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of glioblastoma. "
Multiple Differentially Methylated Regions Specific to Keratoconus Explain Known Keratoconus Linkage Loci.,"Conjunctival filtering bleb scar formation is the main reason for the failure of glaucoma filtration surgery. Cytoglobin (Cygb) has been reported to play an important role in extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, fibrosis and tissue damage repairing. This study aimed to investigate the role of Cygb in anti-scarring during excessive conjunctival wound healing after glaucoma filtration surgery. Cygb was overexpressed in human tenon fibroblasts (hTFs) by transfecting hTFs with lentiviral particles encoding pLenti6.2-FLAG-Cygb. Changes in the mRNA and protein levels of fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, TGF-1, and HIF1 were determined by RT-PCR and western blotting respectively. After Cygb overexpression, hTFs displayed no significant changes in visual appearance and cell counts compared to controls. Whereas, Cygb overexpression significantly decreased the mRNA and protein expression levels of collagen I, collagen III and fibronectin compared with control (p<0.01). There was also a statistically significant decrease in the mRNA and protein levels of TGF-1 and HIF-1 in hTFs with overexpressed Cygb compared with control group (p<0.05). Our study provided evidence that overexpression of Cygb decreased the expression levels of fibronectin, collagen I, collagen III, TGF-1 and HIF-1 in hTFs. Therefore, therapies targeting Cygb expression in hTFs may pave a new way for clinicians to solve the problem of post-glaucoma surgery scarring. "
Angiopoietin-2 as a Marker of Retinopathy in Children and Adolescents With Sickle Cell Disease: Relation to Subclinical Atherosclerosis.,"Many neuropsychiatric phenotypes have been reported in association with rearrangements in the 15q11-q13 region. Clinical presentations can include hypotonia, developmental delay, severe/moderate intellectual disabilities, poor expressive language, difficult to treat epilepsy, and autism spectrum disorders. Here we report an additional case of a girl with inversion duplication on chromosome 15 (Inv-Dup 15) showing a peculiar and milder clinical phenotype, including atypical high-functioning autism disorder, late onset and drug-responsive epilepsy, and a relatively good language development . This report suggests that a diagnosis of Inv-Dup (15) can be suspected during more benign atypical condition with a better outcome than usually reported. "
Response to LTE: Considerations Regarding the Relationship between Anticoagulants Intake and Glaucoma Prognosis in Eyes With Optic Disc Hemorrhages.,"Behet's syndrome (BS) is an idiopathic, chronic, relapsing, multisystem, vascular-inflammatory disease. Neuro-Behet's syndrome (NBS) is a subtype of BS that mainly involves the central nervous system. Because of the heterogeneous involvement of NBS and the limited yearly numbers of new cases of NBS, estimating its course, prognosis, and treatment effect is difficult. Therefore, the efficacy of treatment for any form of NBS is unclear. We experienced a male patient with NBS and severe right uveitis. He received high-dose intravenous methylprednisolone (1000 mg/day) pulse therapy for 3 days. Intravenous injection of cyclophosphamide (400 mg, twice a day) and oral administration of prednisone (40 mg in the morning, 20 mg in the evening) were applied. Uveitis was treated with retrobulbar injection of triamcinolone acetonide (40 mg per week). The patient's response was rapid with improved symptoms and signs. The therapeutic regimen of patients with BS has greatly advanced, leading to evidence-based guidelines. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy is important in treatment of BS. Novel therapeutic options are currently being examined to improve the prognosis of BS. These efforts will undoubtedly shed new light on this complex syndrome. "
Considerations Regarding The Relationship Between Anticoagulants Intake And Glaucoma Prognosis In Eyes With Optic Disc Hemorrhages.,"To evaluate the effect of autologous serum eyedrops treatment on corneal expression of the MUC5AC in patients with limbal deficiency. A prospective and comparative interventional case series study of 42 eyes of 21 patients was performed before and 8 weeks after treatment with autologous serum. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmic assessment of the tear film and ocular surface, corneal impression cytology (IC) and MUC5AC detection by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). Forty-one of the 42 eyes studied were available for both conventional cytology and MUC5AC analysis prior to and after treatment. Differences between outcomes obtained by impression cytology and MUC5AC detection were found in 9 of 82 samples (11%). We found changes in the corneal expression of MUC5AC after treatment in 19 of 41 eyes (46.3%): 18 of them (94.7%) changed from positive to negative expression, and 1 eye (5.3%) changed from negative to positive MUC5AC expression after autologous serum eyedrops. These changes were related with the corneal involvement prior to treatment (15 of them (78.9%) occurred in patients with slight corneal involvement), and with the improvement in the degree of squamous metaplasia after treatment (P=0.001 and P=0.003 respectively). The treatment significantly improved tear stability, squamous metaplasia and subjective patient perception. Autologous serum eyedrops treatment diminished the corneal expression of MUC5AC mainly in patients with slight corneal involvement before treatment. "
Glaucoma in Phacomatosis Pigmentovascularis in a Young African Male: A Case Report.,"To describe a case of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome with concomitant Usher syndrome. A 24-year-old lady with a diagnosis of Ellis-van Creveld syndrome came to our attention in 2015 complaining of nyctalopia. She underwent yearly ophthalmologic examinations, including visual acuity, dilated fundoscopy, optical coherence tomography and colour fundus photography. On the day of her first examination, her visual acuity was 20/20, whereas fundus examination revealed diffuse peripheral retinal atrophy with pigmented bone spicules, waxy pallor of the disc and macular sparing in both eyes, compatible with retinitis pigmentosa. Due to the severe retinitis pigmentosa phenotype for the age and the concomitant neurosensory hearing loss, ancillary electrophysiological and genetic tests were requested. At the end of follow-up, visual function remained stable, with electroretinogram tests confirming the peripheral dysfunction. Interestingly, next generation sequencing test revealed a mutation in USH2A gene, suggestive of an overlapping Usher syndrome. On optical coherence tomography angiography, all plexuses appeared altered, with some degree of impairment also in the choriocapillaris of the spared macula. Our report emphasizes the advantage of new genetic tests to investigate atypical presentations of known retinal disorders found in syndromic settings. In addition, we speculate that the underlying ciliopathy might possibly aggravate the phenotype of this case of Usher syndrome. "
Teleophthalmology Screening for Diabetic Retinopathy in Brazil: Applicability and Economic Assessment.,"To test a model of integrated pediatric eye care delivery and examine the prevalence and factors associated with childhood ocular morbidity in a peri-urban setting in Bangladesh. Cross-sectional, population-based study. The study was conducted in three phases among children aged 15 years. Trained community health workers (CHWs) conducted awareness intervention and identified children with ocular problems. These children were then referred to the base hospital for examination and treatment by ophthalmologists. A pediatric ophthalmologist further examined the children with complicated eye diseases and ensured treatment at a tertiary public eye hospital. Awareness, referral patterns, and health-seeking behavior were also examined. All data were analyzed statistically using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. CHWs screened 33,549 eligible children and identified 1887 cases with ocular morbidity. The prevalence of ocular morbidity and childhood blindness were 5.63% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 5.27-6.16) and 0.060% (95% CI = 0.03-0.11), respectively. The most commonly observed ocular morbidities were refractive error (3.24%; 95% CI = 3.11-3.45), allergic eye conditions (1.2%; 95% = CI 0.74-1.27), and nasolacrimal duct obstruction (0.52%; 95% CI = 0.25-0.74). Blindness was more frequently seen in children aged <5 years than in those aged 5-15 years (<sup>2</sup>=7.25; P=0.007). The causes of blindness were corneal opacity, congenital eye anomaly, cataract, retinopathy of prematurity, and retinoblastoma. The prevalence of ocular morbidity was higher among older children, boys, children with low parental education and income, and children from households dwelling in slums. This study demonstrated that in a setting where screening and treatment for vision problems remain low, ocular morbidity among children could be easily identified through well-designed community-based screening programs involving appropriately trained CHWs. Community mobilization, awareness, and early detection of childhood eye diseases, with effective referral mechanisms for accessing appropriate care, are crucially important to improve service delivery. "
Retinal Transcriptome Analysis in the Treatment of Endotoxin-Induced Uveitis with Tetramethylpyrazine Eye Drops.,"Increased fundus autofluorescence is directly related to increased RPE lipofuscin deposition in the retina and has been observed in eyes with age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Smoking is the most significant modifiable risk factor for the development and progression of AMD, in which one of the main mechanisms is oxidative damage from smoking leading to RPE cell toxicity. The relationship between smoking and autofluorescence is not established and could provide insight into pathogenic mechanism of AMD. Therefore, our objective was to compare quantitative fundus autofluorescence (qAF) in the retinae of healthy non-smokers to smokers. We conducted a cross-sectional study at the 2016 Minnesota State Fair. Participants self-reported past medical and ocular history and underwent eye examination as well as qAF imaging with Spectralis confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (cSLO) equipped with an internal fluorescent reference. Two sets of images were obtained per eye. Stepwise multiple mixed effects regression model was used to examine the relationship between mean qAF values and smoking status. We enrolled 105 individuals (54 smokers, 61 females, mean age 41 years with range 18-78 years old). Fundus autofluorescence images were analyzable for 85 of 105 individuals contributing 161 eyes (80 right, 81 left). The repeatability coefficients between the first set and second set of images were 21% of their mean qAF values. Older age and female gender were independently associated with higher qAF. Positive smoking history tended to result in higher qAF values after adjusting for age and gender but was not statistically significant (0.118, 95%CI -0.003, 0.240, P=0.056). Among smokers, the number of pack-years smoked was not significantly associated with higher qAF. Our study's results are consistent with existing literature in which older age is predictive of intensified autofluorescence, while smoking history does not have as important of an impact on autofluorescence as hypothesized. Several large epidemiological studies have shown that smoking is significantly associated with AMD, and qAF is likely not the appropriate modality to clinically assess smoking's impact on retinae. "
Eyes on New Product Development.,"To describe a novel surgical technique to remove retained subfoveal perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL). After setting up for 23-G pars plana vitrectomy, a 38-G flexible-tip macular hydrodissection cannula connected to the automated viscous fluid infusion kit was used to create a small retinotomy approximately 700 m to 800 m inferior to the fovea and induce macular detachment involving the retained PFCL bubble. The flexible cannula was bent at its junction with the shaft and was carefully advanced through the same retinotomy into the subretinal space to access and directly aspirate the retained subfoveal PFCL bubble. Fluid-air exchange was then performed, and surgery was concluded. The retained subfoveal PFCL bubble was successfully removed with restoration of normal foveal architecture on optical coherence tomography and with objective and subjective improvement of central vision. We report a novel surgical technique combining macular detachment with direct aspiration of the retained subfoveal PFCL without direct perforation of the foveal center. This technique may provide an alternative approach to manage this difficult complication. "
Long-Term Outcome of Punctate Inner Choroidopathy or Multifocal Choroiditis with Active Choroidal Neovascularization Managed with Intravitreal Bevacizumab.,"To describe multimodal imaging findings, including fundus autofluorescence, in a patient with a growing choroidal osteoma. Case report. A 13-year-old girl presented with an asymptomatic lesion in the superonasal macula of her left eye. Vision was correctable to 20/20 in both eyes, and the only significant finding on examination was the yellow flat lesion in the left macula. It measured 0.8-disk areas in size. Ocular coherence tomography showed a space occupying lesion in the choroid that had horizontal hyper-reflective lines consistent with cancellous bone. Re-examination in a year showed enlargement. Fundus autofluorescence showed no abnormalities in either eye. Ultrasonography showed a hyper-reflective lesion with associated shadowing that was consistent with a choroidal osteoma. Normal fundus autofluorescence was seen in this young girl with a growing choroidal osteoma. Fundus autofluorescence is a proxy for the health of the retinal pigment epithelium. Normal retinal pigment epithelium is the only factor found to be predictive of future growth of a choroidal osteoma. This noninvasive test may prove useful as a guide to determine frequency of examinations especially in younger patients who might be prone to more rapid growth.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

The Relation of Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio and Platelet to Lymphocyte Ratio with High Axial Myopia.,"To investigate the age-related course of best-corrected visual acuity in healthy eyes. Two hundred participants (400 eyes) 25 to 74years of age (114 females, 86 males) were investigated, 20 per 5-year age group. Best-corrected visual acuity was measured monocularly with the ETDRS 2000 charts at a distance of 4m (Precision Vision, Woodstock, IL, USA). Strict exclusion and termination criteria were used. Visual acuity did not change between ages 25 and 54years (mean of the better eyes, -0.180.05 logMAR). A significant age-related break-point in visual acuity was found at the ages of 55-59years. For all age groups, the overall mean visual acuity was -0.150.06 logMAR for the better eyes and -0.130.06 logMAR for the worse eyes. There was no difference between the right and left eyes (-0.140.06 logMAR). The visual acuity was better in the right eye in 29% (n=58) of the participants, better in the left eye in 32% (n=64), and the same in both eyes in 39% (n=78). From ages 25 to 64years, neither the better nor the worse eye had a visual acuity worse than 0.0 logMAR. Best-corrected visual acuity was constantly high until the age of 54years. An age-related break-point appeared at 55 to 59years of age. Until age 64, a minimal angle of resolution smaller than 1min of arc (visual acuity better 0.0 logMAR) can be expected in healthy eyes. "
Establishing an allied health professional delivered selective laser trabeculoplasty service in Scotland.,"To describe a case of Blau panuveitis, characterized on both portable and tabletop wide-field fluorescein angiography, which resolved on systemic immunosuppression. A 5-year-old female presented with bilateral eye pain, redness, and decreased visual acuity due to panuveitis and had a history of arthritis, tenosynovitis, and dermatitis. Similar ocular and systemic findings in the patient's mother and maternal half-brother prompted genetic testing that confirmed the diagnosis of the rare Blau syndrome. Portable Retcam and tabletop Optos wide-field fluorescein angiography congruently demonstrated retinal vascular and peripapillary leakage. The uveitis dramatically resolved after the addition of adalimumab to methotrexate. Quiescence was maintained with the substitution of infliximab for adalimumab. To our knowledge, we are first to characterize Blau panuveitis retinal findings on wide-field fluorescein angiography and with the use of two different photography systems. Additionally, this report underscores the salient clinical findings of a rare disorder and suggests that robust systemic immunosuppression can effectively treat refractory ocular inflammation. "
The components of adult astigmatism and their age-related changes.,"Ocular toxoplasmosis occurs subsequently after systemic infection with the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii(T. gondii). The parasite has ahigh affinity for retinal microvascular endothelium with the retina being the primary site of infection in the eye. Choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) is a late complication of ocular toxoplasmosis, mostly occurring in healed, inactive lesions and may be a cause of sudden loss of vision, especially in young patients. However, we report a case of a 22-year-old female who presented to our clinic with CNVM as an early complication. She complained of metamorphopsia and diminished vision in her right eye. Ocular examination, serological investigationandfundoscopy, fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), axial optical coherence tomography (OCT), and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) were carried out and a diagnosis of primary acquired Toxoplasma retinochoroiditis with active CNVM was made. Treatment was commenced with sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim. Oral prednisolone and intravitreal injectionof the anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF), bevacizumab, were also given. This report describes the rare presentation of ocular toxoplasmosis as a primary lesionin whichadjacent pre-existing fundal scarringwas absent. The lesion had an acquired etiology in an immunocompetent patient and was complicated early byCNVM. "
Changes in the anterior segment of the eye following uncomplicated pars plana vitrectomy. A review.,"Rett syndrome (RS) is a severe neurological developmental disorder characterised by stereotypical hand movements, epileptic seizures, craniofacial dysmorphism and digestive dysfunction. This study aimed to examine the correlation between the severity of malocclusion and <i>dysphagia</i> in patients with RS. This preliminary study was conducted at the Ear, Nose & Throat Clinic of the University Hospital of Siena, Siena, Italy, from January 2014 to December 2017. A total of 56 patients with RS were examined and grouped according to the severity of <i>dysphagia</i> (absent, mild, moderate or severe) and malocclusion (<2 mm, 2-3 mm, 3-4 mm or >4 mm). All of the patients were female and the mean age was 11.3 years. Eight (14.3%) patients had mild, 18 (32.1%) had moderate and 30 (53.6%) had severe <i>dysphagia</i>. Four (7.1%) patients had <2 mm occlusion, 10 (17.9%) had 2-3 mm occlusion, 26 (46.4%) had 3-4 mm occlusion and 16 (28.6%) had >4 mm occlusion. Mild <i>dysphagia</i> was observed in 100% and 40% of patients with <2 and 2-3 mm malocclusion, respectively, while moderate <i>dysphagia</i> was present in 60% and 38.5% of patients with 2-3 and 3-4 mm malocclusion, respectively. Severe <i>dysphagia</i> was observed in 28.6% and 87.5% of patients with 3-4 and >4 mm malocclusion, respectively. There was a significant correlation between <i>dysphagia</i> and malocclusion severity (<i>P</i> <0.001). A higher degree of malocclusion was associated with more severe <i>dysphagia</i> among a cohort of patients with RS. "
"Expression of immune checkpoint receptors Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase and T cell Ig and ITIM domain in metastatic versus nonmetastatic choroidal melanoma.","The aim of the present meta-analysis was to compare the maximum oxygen uptake (VO2max) characteristics of male soccer players relative to their competitive level, playing position and age group and the interaction between them. The meta-analysis was based on 16 studies, employing 2385 soccer players aged 10-39 years. Higher-level soccer players showed greater (ES = 0.58 [95% CI 0.08-1.08], SE = 0.25, var = 0.06, z = 2.29, p = 0.022) VO2max performance with respect to their lower level counterparts. Furthermore, lower VO2max values in goalkeepers than defenders (ES = 1.31 (SE 0.46) [95% CI 0.41-2.21], var = 0.21, z = 2.84, p = 0.004) and midfielders (ES = 1.37 (SE 0.41) [95% CI 0.58 to 2.17], var = 0.16, z = 3.40, p = 0.001) were found. Thus, VO2max increased significantly with age (all, p < 0.01): Under 10 versus Under 11 years, Under 11 versus Under 12 years, Under 12 versus Under 13 years, Under 13 versus Under 14 years, Under 14 versus Under 15 years and Under 16-18 versus Under 20-23 years. VO2max performance is the most powerful discriminator between higher and lower-level soccer players. These findings indicate also the need for sports scientists and conditioning professionals to take the VO2max performance of soccer players into account when designing individualized position specific training programs.

Mouse Extraocular Muscles and the Musculotopic Organization of their Innervation.,"Aflibercept and ranibizumab are novel drugs for effectively treating wet age-associated macular degeneration (AMD). In the present study, the effect of aflibercept and ranibizumab on wet AMD was compared. A total of 80 AMD patients were intravitreously treated with aflibercept (2.0 mg/dose, 40 participants) or ranibizumab (0.3 mg/dose, 40 participants). The mean visual acuity and central subfield thickness (CTS) were determined at baseline and each follow-up visit (every 4 weeks). ELISA was used to detect the expression of transforming growth factor-1 (TGF-1), monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The primary outcome was the mean change in visual acuity letter score (VAS) and CTS at 1 year. The VAS was markedly improved by 13.1 in the aflibercept group and by 11.0 in the ranibizumab group. In a subgroup of patients with an initial VAS of <69, the mean improvement in the VAS was 17.7 in the aflibercept group and 13.2 in the ranibizumab group (P<0.01). The mean CTS was markedly decreased by 141 in the aflibercept group and by 134 in the ranibizumab group. In the subgroup of patients with an initial VAS of <69, the mean CTS was decreased by 171 in the aflibercept group and by 154 in the ranibizumab group (P<0.01). However, the change of VAS and CTS was similar between the ranibizumab and aflibercept groups when the initial VAS was 69. No significant differences in serious adverse events were identified between the aflibercept and ranibizumab groups. The levels of TGF-1, IL-6 and MCP-1 were decreased by the aflibercept and ranibizumab treatments. The decrease in the levels of the inflammatory factors was more obvious in patients with an initial VAS of <69 in comparison with that in patients with an initial VAS of 69. Negative correlations between the levels of TGF-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 and the mean change of VAS when patients were treated with aflibercept or ranibizumab were identified among all ages. Positive correlations between the levels of TGF-1, MCP-1 and IL-6 and the mean change of CTS were observed when the initial VAS of the patients was <69. In conclusion, the efficacy of aflibercept in treating patients with AMD was better than that of ranibizumab when the initial VAS of the patients was <69. The inhibition of inflammatory factors may be a secondary effect of aflibercept and ranibizumab treatment. The present study provides a useful reference for the clinical treatment of wet AMD (Chinese Clinical Trial Registry no. ChiCTR1800017782). "
Overexpression of microRNA-186 inhibits angiogenesis in retinoblastoma via the Hedgehog signaling pathway by targeting ATAD2.,"The determination of potential transplantable substrates and substitution cells for corneal endothelium transplantation may compensate for the shortage of cornea donors. Appropriate biodegradable and biocompatible tissue-engineered substratum with seed cells for endothelial keratoplasty has been increasingly studied. In the present study, electrospun gelatin/polycaprolactone (PCL) and collagen/PCL scaffolds were successfully established. Bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells (BEPCs) were cultured on these scaffolds to determine whether the scaffolds may promote the proliferation of BEPCs as well as maintain stem cell characteristics. Two variations of hybrid scaffolds, collagen/PCL (70% collagen and 30% PCL) and gelatin/PCL (70% gelatin and 30% PCL), were established via electrospinning. Microscopic structure, hydrophilicity and wettability of the two scaffolds were subsequently investigated. BEPCs were separately cultured on the scaffolds and were also seeded on glass slides to establish the control group. Furthermore, cell morphology; adherence, as determined by investigation of F-actin expression levels; proliferation, as determined via Cell Counting Kit-8 assays, Ki-67 staining and bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) staining; and stem cell markers, as determined by cluster of differentiation (CD)-34 and CD-133 protein expression levels; were investigated. In addition, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to determine gene expression. The two nanofiber scaffolds were established using electrospun techniques with expected hydrophilicity, wettability and biocompatibility. BEPCs were revealed to spread well on and strongly adhere to the collagen/PCL (70:30) and gelatin/PCL (70:30) scaffolds. Furthermore, Ki-67 and BrdU staining results revealed greater levels of positive dots on the two hybrid scaffolds compared with the control group. CD-34 and CD-133 protein staining demonstrated increased levels of fluorescence intensity on scaffolds compared with the control group. Furthermore, increased expression levels of differentiation markers, such as ATP binding cassette subfamily G member 2, leucine rich repeat containing G protein-coupled receptor 5 and CD166, were detected on both scaffolds. RT-qPCR results demonstrated that the expression of caspase-3, which is associated with apoptosis, was decreased on the two scaffolds compared with in the control group. The expression of inflammatory factors, including interleukin (IL)-1, exhibited a significant decrease on the gelatin/PCL scaffold compared with in the control group; whereas the difference between the expression level of IL-1 exhibited by the collagen/PCL group and the control group were not markedly different. Electrospun collagen/PCL and gelatin/PCL scaffolds exhibited the potential to enhance the adherence and proliferation of BEPCs. BEPCs cultured on the two scaffolds demonstrated increased stem cell characteristics and differentiation potential. Electrospun gelatin/PCL and collagen/PCL scaffolds may represent a promising substratum in tissue-engineered corneal endothelium. "
Trends in phenotype in the English paediatric Neurofibromatosis Type 2 cohort stratified by genetic severity.,"Autologous cultivated oral mucosal epithelial transplantation (COMET) is an important treatment for limbal stem cell deficiency. However, peripheral corneal neovascularization after surgery hinders its application. This study aims to employ a culture system using allogenic limbal niche cells (LNCs) instead of mouse-derived 3T3 cells as a feeder layer that could relieve postoperative neovascularization. Rat oral mucosal epithelial cells (OMECs) were co-cultured with rat LNCs or 3T3 cells. Cultivated oral mucosal epithelial cells (COMECs) of different culture systems were identified by hematoxylin and eosin staining and immunocytochemistry. The expression levels of the angiogenesis-related factors were analyzed by RT-qPCR and western blotting/ELISA. Angiogenic potential was reconfirmed by cell viability and tube formation assays with human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). COMECs were obtained from both culture systems successfully. Immunocytochemistry showed approximately equal percentages of positive staining cells for p63 (<i>p</i>=0.9177), ABCG2 (<i>p</i>=0.526), Ki67 (<i>p</i>=0.0987), and CK3 (<i>p</i>=0.4000) in COMECs of different groups. RT-qPCR and western blotting/ELISA showed that COMECs of the LNC group expressed a significantly lower amount of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) (<i>p</i>=0.0038 for RT-qPCR, <i>p</i>=0.0026 for western blotting) but more pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) (<i>p</i>=0.0172 for RT-qPCR, <i>p</i>=0.0253 for western blotting) and soluble fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (sFlt-1) (<i>p</i><0.0001 for RT-qPCR, <i>p</i>=0.0064 for ELISA) than the COMECs of the 3T3 group. Furthermore, compared with COMECs of the 3T3 group, COMECs of the LNC group could reduce the viability (<i>p</i>=0.0002) and tube formation (<i>p</i>=0.0002) of HUVECs. LNCs could substitute 3T3 cells for expanding OMECs in vitro, and the COMECs obtained in this system are less likely to induce postsurgical neovascularization, which provides an alternative option for an ex vivo culture system and promotes the application of COMET.

PACAP Attenuates Optic Nerve Crush-Induced Retinal Ganglion Cell Apoptosis Via Activation of the CREB-Bcl-2 Pathway.,"Esophageal cancer (EC) is one of the malignant tumors with a poor prognosis. The early stage of EC is asymptomatic, so identification of cancer biomarkers is important for early detection and clinical practice. In this study, we compared the protein expression profiles in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) tissues and adjacent normal esophageal tissues from five patients through high-resolution label-free mass spectrometry. Through bioinformatics analysis, we found the differentially expressed proteins of ESCC. To perform the rapid identification of biomarkers, we adopted a high-throughput protein identification technique of Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB). Meanwhile, the QDB results were verified by classical immunohistochemistry. In total 2297 proteins were identified, out of which 308 proteins were differentially expressed between ESCC tissues and normal tissues. By bioinformatics analysis, the four up-regulated proteins (PTMA, PAK2, PPP1CA, HMGB2) and the five down-regulated proteins (Caveolin, Integrin beta-1, Collagen alpha-2(VI), Leiomodin-1 and Vinculin) were selected and validated in ESCC by Western Blot. Furthermore, we performed the QDB and IHC analysis in 64 patients and 117 patients, respectively. The PTMA expression was up-regulated gradually along the progression of ESCC, and the PTMA expression ratio between tumor and adjacent normal tissue was significantly increased along with the progression. Therefore, we suggest that PTMA might be a potential candidate biomarker for ESCC. In this study, label-free quantitative proteomics combined with QDB revealed that PTMA expression was up-regulated in ESCC tissues, and PTMA might be a potential candidate for ESCC. Since Western Blot cannot achieve rapid and high-throughput screening of mass spectrometry results, the emergence of QDB meets this demand and provides an effective method for the identification of biomarkers.

Implementations of 3D printing in ophthalmology.,"Vitreomacular traction (VMT) is a disease in which the vitreous exerts abnormally strong traction on the macula, the area of the eye responsible for detailed central vision. If this traction significantly distorts the macula then VMT can lead to troublesome distorted vision (metamorphopsia), sometimes occurring despite relatively preserved visual acuity. Ocriplasmin, administered as a single intravitreal injection, aims to release VMT and improve vision. While the effect of ocriplasmin on traction release and visual acuity is well characterized, the effect of symptoms like metamorphopsia is not. A systematic review and synthesis of the literature on patient reported outcomes (PRO) in relation to the use of ocriplasmin for the treatment of VMT was undertaken using MED-LINE and Embase databases, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials (CENTRAL). The review identified PRO data from 870 patients across three randomized controlled trials. The most commonly reported PROs were the 25-item National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (VFQ-25), a broad measure of vision-related quality of life, and Visual Function Response (VFR), an outcome combining quality of life and visual acuity outcomes. Treatment with ocriplasmin produced significant patient benefit vs control (sham or placebo-injection). Ocriplasmin was associated with a higher proportion of patients experiencing a clinically meaningful improvement in visual functioning with a difference of 11.8% for VFQ-25 and 23.2% for VFR responder analyses, respectively. Patients with VMT have material impairment in visual functioning and quality of life, relative to their reduction in visual acuity. Ocriplasmin results in a significant improvement in visual functioning. Future research could include the development of new PROs specific to VMT. "
Malignant transformation of a conjunctival keratoacanthoma requiring enucleation.,"To investigate the efficacy and safety of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) for corneal decompensation following primary Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty (DSAEK). This was a retrospective case series of 15 patients that underwent DMEK surgery for corneal decompensation after failed DSAEK. Main outcome parameter was corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) after DMEK and DSAEK. Secondary outcome measures included central corneal thickness (CCT), endothelial cell density (ECD), rebubbling rate, and primary graft failure after DMEK. Explanted DSAEK grafts were evaluated by light microscopy. The mean (SD) time period between DSAEK and DMEK surgery was 158 months (range, 6-31 months). Preoperative CDVA was 1.720.62 (logMAR). After DMEK, CDVA improved significantly to 0.780.48 at 1 month and to 0.230.24 after 12 months (<i>P</i>=0.022). Visual acuity data after DMEK were significantly better compared to preoperative values. The average CCT after DMEK decreased significantly from 869210 m (preoperative) to 50545 m (1 month postoperative) (<i>P</i><0.001) and remained stable over 12 months. The ECD decreased from 2,589209/mm<sup>2</sup> (preoperative) to 1,691589/mm<sup>2</sup> (12 months postoperative). Rebubbling DMEK was required in three patients (=20%). DMEK represents a feasible and safe procedure in achieving better functional results compared to DSAEK. Visual acuity and optical quality can be effectively reestablished after unsuccessful primary DSAEK surgery even in patients with long-standing corneal decompensation. Further investigations are required to validate the preliminary clinical findings. "
Genome-wide meta-analysis identifies multiple novel loci associated with serum uric acid levels in Japanese individuals.,"The mammalian CNS is capable of tolerating chronic hypoxia, but cell type-specific responses to this stress have not been systematically characterized. In the Norrin KO (<i>Ndp</i><sup>\n                        <i>KO</i>\n                    </sup> ) mouse, a model of familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR), developmental hypovascularization of the retina produces chronic hypoxia of inner nuclear-layer (INL) neurons and Muller glia. We used single-cell RNA sequencing, untargeted metabolomics, and metabolite labeling from <sup>13</sup>C-glucose to compare WT and <i>Ndp</i><sup>\n                        <i>KO</i>\n                    </sup> retinas. In <i>Ndp</i><sup>\n                        <i>KO</i>\n                    </sup> retinas, we observe gene expression responses consistent with hypoxia in Muller glia and retinal neurons, and we find a metabolic shift that combines reduced flux through the TCA cycle with increased synthesis of serine, glycine, and glutathione. We also used single-cell RNA sequencing to compare the responses of individual cell types in <i>Ndp</i><sup>\n                        <i>KO</i>\n                    </sup> retinas with those in the hypoxic cerebral cortex of mice that were housed for 1 week in a reduced oxygen environment (7.5% oxygen). In the hypoxic cerebral cortex, glial transcriptome responses most closely resemble the response of Muller glia in the <i>Ndp</i><sup>\n                        <i>KO</i>\n                    </sup> retina. In both retina and brain, vascular endothelial cells activate a previously dormant tip cell gene expression program, which likely underlies the adaptive neoangiogenic response to chronic hypoxia. These analyses of retina and brain transcriptomes at single-cell resolution reveal both shared and cell type-specific changes in gene expression in response to chronic hypoxia, implying both shared and distinct cell type-specific physiologic responses.

Microcirculation in the conjunctiva and retina in healthy subjects.,"To describe ocular injuries caused by badminton and to explore the implications for future prevention strategies. We enrolled 85 patients with ocular trauma caused by badminton. Information collected from patients included type of game, instigator, instrument of injury and lessons in badminton from a professional, and ocular trauma information such as type of injury, treatment and final outcomes. The 85 patients (52 men, 33 women) were aged 15-65 years with an average age of 42.9 (10.7) years. In 60 cases the player was hit by a shuttlecock and in 25 the player was hit by a racquet. 73 cases occurred in doubles matches and 10 in singles matches. In 31 cases the trauma was caused by an opponent and in 52 cases by a partner; 2 cases involved bystanders, not players. About 70% (43/61) of the injured and 82% (40/49) of the instigators had not received badminton lessons from a professional. 80 injuries were non-penetrating and 5 were penetrating. There were 58 cases with hyphaema, 36 with secondary glaucoma, 23 with lens subluxation and 2 with retinal detachment. Surgery comprised phacoemulsification or lensectomy and vitrectomy in 16 cases, silicone oil tamponade in 2 cases, trabeculectomy in 3 cases and direct cyclopexy in 5 cases. The vast majority of the badminton related eye injuries occurred among doubles players and were instigated by the injured person's partner. Non-penetrating injury was more frequent; penetrating injury was usually more serious. We recommend that badminton players use protective eyewear and receive safety education and professional coaching/instruction on techniques to protect against serious eye injuries. "
Intralenticular foreign body: A case report and literature review.,"Fabry disease is a rare, X-linked, lifelong progressive lysosomal storage disorder. Severely deficient -galactosidase A activity in males is associated with the classic phenotype with early-onset, multisystem manifestations evolving to vital organ complications during adulthood. We assessed the ability of 2 low-dose agalsidase beta regimens to lower skin, plasma, and urine globotriaosylceramide (GL-3) levels, and influence clinical manifestations in male pediatric Fabry patients. In this multicenter, open-label, parallel-group, phase 3b study, male patients aged 5-18years were randomized to receive agalsidase beta at 0.5mg/kg 2-weekly (n=16) or 1.0mg/kg 4-weekly (n=15) for 5years. All had plasma/urine GL-3 accumulation but no clinically evident organ involvement. The primary outcome was GL-3 accumulation in superficial skin capillary endothelium (SSCE). The mean age was 11.6 (range: 5-18) years and all but one of the 31 patients had classic GLA mutations. In the overall cohort, shifts from non-0 to 0-scores for SSCE GL-3 were significant at years 1, 3, and 5, but results were variable. Plasma GL-3 normalized and urine GL-3 reduced substantially. Higher anti-agalsidase beta antibody titers were associated with less robust SSCE GL-3 clearance and higher urine GL-3 levels. Renal function remained stable and normal. Most Fabry signs and symptoms tended to stabilize; abdominal pain was significantly reduced (-26.3%; P=.0215). No new clinical major organ complications were observed. GL-3 accumulation and cellular and vascular injury were present in baseline kidney biopsies (n=7). Treatment effects on podocyte GL-3 content and foot process width were highly variable. Fabry arteriopathy overall increased in severity. Two patients withdrew and 2 had their agalsidase beta dose increased. Our findings increase the limited amount of available data on long-term effects of enzyme replacement therapy in pediatric, classic Fabry patients. The low-dose regimens studied here over a period of 5years did not demonstrate a consistent benefit among the patients in terms of controlling symptomatology, urine GL-3 levels, and pathological histology. The current available evidence supports treatment of pediatric, classic male Fabry patients at the approved agalsidase beta dose of 1.0mg/kg 2-weekly if these patients are considered for enzyme replacement therapy with agalsidase beta.

Laser treatment of silicone intraocular lens opacification associated with asteroid hyalosis.,"To characterize the risk factors, clinical presentations, management, outcomes, and microbiological properties of Streptococcus pyogenes keratitis. Eight culture-proven cases (eight eyes) of S. pyogenes keratitis were diagnosed and treated between 2008 and 2018 at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC). Medical records were available for six patients, and these were reviewed to identify demographic information, systemic and ocular history, clinical presentations, antibiotic sensitivity, treatments, and outcomes of S. pyogenes isolates. Of the six charts reviewed, the median patient age was 67 years and all patients were female. Four patients had a history of cataract extraction more than one year prior to presentation, one had a history of improper contact lens use, and one had basement membrane dystrophy. Two patients, who also happened to have the most serious medical comorbidities, presented with corneal perforation on initial examination. The median follow-up length was 90.5 days. Visual outcomes varied greatly between patients. Three patients had visual acuity ranging from 20/30 to 20/70, while the two patients with corneal perforation had a final visual acuity of light perception, and one patient was lost to follow-up. Five of six isolates were susceptible to fluoroquinolones and all isolates were susceptible to cefazolin. S. pyogenes represented an uncommon ocular pathogen at UPMC eye clinic. However, if left untreated, this infection resulted in severe ocular morbidity. The majority of patients had a benign ocular history, suggesting that S. pyogenes can infect healthy corneas in immunocompetent patients. The majority of isolates were susceptible to cefazolin and fluoroquinolones. "
A novel minimal fluid technique for effective and safe lens hydrodissection during cataract surgery.,"To examine the incidence of intracapsular hemorrhage in orbital fracture repair with non-fixated nylon sheet implants. A retrospective chart review of 227 patients presenting from January 2013 to December 2016 for orbital fracture repair with nylon sheet implants. Of the 331 orbital fractures repaired over 4years, a total of 227 met inclusion criteria. The average implant thickness was 0.38mm and no implants were fixated. Four total implants (1.8%) were removed due to complications; one each secondary to exploration for ongoing postoperative diplopia, immediate post-operative orbital hemorrhage, a cystic mass anterior to the implant, and pain. There were no cases of intracapsular hemorrhage nor infection for any of the 227 patients over 4years. To the authors knowledge, this represents the largest case series to date to assess the rate of intracapsular hemorrhage in non-fixated nylon sheet orbital implants. In the 227 cases reviewed over a 4-year period, there were no cases of intracapsular hemorrhage. This suggests a much lower complication rate than previously reported. PRCIS: A case series of 227 patients who underwent orbital fracture repair with non-fixated nylon sheet implants. "
A comparison of the contrast sensitivity function between age-matched phakic emmetropes and pseudophakic individuals with aspheric intraocular lenses.,"Cold hypersensitivity in the hands and feet (CHHF) is frequent in Asian countries including Korea. The quality of life can be degraded by the symptoms of CHHF. In particular, gynecological disorders such as menstrual pain, infertility, leucorrhea, and irregular bleeding may be related to CHHF. Sipjeondaebo-tang (SDT) is widely used in the treatment of various diseases including CHHF by balancing Yin and Yang, restoring the deterioration of physiological function, and improving immunity. However, the efficacy of SDT in the treatment of CHHF has not been assessed in clinical trials. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the feasibility of a full randomized clinical trial of SDT for the treatment of CHHF in Korean women through this trial. This study will be a pilot, randomized, double-blind, two-arm, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multicenter clinical trial. Women aged 19-59years who present with CHHF will be recruited from five university hospitals. A total of 60 subjects will be randomly assigned to a treatment group (SDT) or a placebo group at a 1:1 ratio. The subjects will receive 3g of either SDT or placebo three times daily for 8weeks. The primary outcome measures will be the Visual Analogue Scale scores of CHHF. The secondary outcome measures will be changes in body temperature in both the hands and the feet as measured using a thermometer and the Korean version of the World Health Organization Quality of Life Scale Abbreviated Version. This will be the first trial to investigate the efficacy and safety of SDT in the treatment of CHHF. This study will provide basic clinical information regarding Korean herbal medicine treatment of CHHF and a clinical basis for designing a full randomized clinical trial.

Utilizing intraoperative aberrometry and digital eye tracking to develop a novel nomogram for manual astigmatic keratotomy to effectively decrease mild astigmatism during cataract surgery.,"Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) is a rare, aggressive B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that often affects men over the age of 60. Systemic metastasis of MCL to eyes is rare and intraocular involvement is even rarer, which usually affects the choroid and iris. To the best of our knowledge, ciliary body metastasis of systemic MCL has not been reported. A 59-year-old Han Chinese male with past-history of systemic MCL complained of redness, pain and blurred vision in the left eye. Ocular examination revealed a normal appearance in the right eye, and conjunctival injection, pseudohypopyon and anterior protrusion of peripheral iris in the left eye, all of which were unresponsive to corticosteroid treatments. Ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) and B-scan were then performed which detected ciliary body masses in both eyes with no vitreous and retino-choroidal anomalies. Combined liquid-based cytology tests and gene rearrangement assays of the aqueous humor specimen confirmed this to be a B-cell malignancy. Then both eyes were treated with external beam irradiation (40Gy, delivered evenly in twenty fractions) over a course of one month. Additionally, the left eye received intravitreal methotrexate (MTX) (weekly for the first month, every two weeks for the second month, and monthly thereafter) over a course of twelve months. This therapy eventually led to complete remission of all symptoms in one month and disappearance of the ciliary body masses in twelve months. Here we first reported a case of bilateral ciliary body MCL infiltration which was diagnosed by combined liguid-based cytology and gene rearrangement of aqueous humor cells. UBM may serve as a valuable tool in the diagnosis and serial assessments of anterior segment tumors. "
Step-by-step Descemet's membrane endothelial keratoplasty surgery.,"The aim of this study is to assess if an adhesive biopolymer, sodium hyaluronate (NaHA), has synergistic effects with s-PRGF (a serum derived from plasma rich in growth factors and a blood derivative that has already shown efficacy in corneal epithelial wound healing), to reduce time of healing or posology. In vitro proliferation and migration studies, both in human corneal epithelial (HCE) cells and in rabbit primary corneal epithelial (RPCE) cultures, were carried out. In addition, we performed studies of corneal wound healing in vivo in rabbits treated with s-PRGF, NaHA, or the combination of both. We performed immunohistochemistry techniques (CK3, CK15, Ki67, 4 integrin, ZO-1, -SMA) in rabbit corneas 7 and 30 days after a surgically induced epithelial defect. In vitro results show that the combination of NaHA and s-PRGF offers the worst proliferation rates in both HCE and RPCE cells. Addition of NaHA to s-PRGF diminishes the re-epithelializing capability of s-PRGF. In vivo, all treatments, given twice a day, showed equivalent efficacy in corneal epithelial healing. We conclude that the combined use of s-PRGF and HaNA as an adhesive biopolymer does not improve the efficacy of s-PRGF alone in the wound healing of corneal epithelial defects. "
Intraocular lens correction of presbyopia.,"LOXL1 (lysyl oxidase-like 1) has been identified as the major effect locus in pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome, a fibrotic disorder of the extracellular matrix and frequent cause of chronic open-angle glaucoma. However, all known PEX-associated common variants show allele effect reversal in populations of different ancestry, casting doubt on their biological significance. Based on extensive LOXL1 deep sequencing, we report here the identification of a common noncoding sequence variant, rs7173049A>G, located downstream of LOXL1, consistently associated with a decrease in PEX risk (OR=0.63, p=6.33x10-31) in nine different ethnic populations. We provide experimental evidence for a functional enhancer-like regulatory activity of the genomic region surrounding rs7173049 influencing expression levels of ISLR2 (immunoglobulin superfamily containing leucine-rich repeat protein 2) and STRA6 (stimulated by retinoic acid receptor 6), apparently mediated by allele-specific binding of the transcription factor THR (thyroid hormone receptor beta). We further show that the protective rs7173049-G allele correlates with increased tissue expression levels of ISLR2 and STRA6 and that both genes are significantly downregulated in tissues of PEX patients together with other key components of the STRA6 receptor-driven retinoic acid signaling pathway. siRNA-mediated downregulation of retinoic acid signaling induces upregulation of LOXL1 and PEX-associated matrix genes in PEX-relevant cell types. These data indicate that dysregulation of STRA6 and impaired retinoid metabolismare involved in the pathophysiology of PEX syndrome and that the variant rs7173049-G, which represents the first common variant at the broad LOXL1 locus without allele effect reversal, mediates a protective effect through upregulation of STRA6 in ocular tissues.

"Refractive cataract surgery - what we were, what we are, and what we will be: A personal experience and perspective.","To demonstrate a rapid improvement of recalcitrant cystoid macular edema (CME) and perivascular leakage, in a patient with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy and autoimmune optic neuropathy after treatment with sarilumab, a human anti-interleukin-6 (IL-6) receptor antibody. Observational case report. A 29-year-old woman was diagnosed with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy and autoimmune optic neuropathy and followed over 1.5 years. She had recalcitrant CME despite local corticosteroid and immunosuppressive therapy that included azathioprine and adalimumab. Subcutaneous sarilumab was initiated at a dose of 200 mg every 2 weeks. Cystoid macular edema significantly decreased after two injections and resolved after four injections with associated improvement in visual acuity and significant improvement in perivascular leakage on fluorescein angiography. There was a sustained visual and anatomical improvement at 6 months along with mild improvement in electroretinogram responses. The patient tolerated the medication with no side effects. Management of CME in non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy is challenging, and long-term immunosuppression is often employed with varying degrees of success. The improvement in refractory CME and perivascular leakage in this case supports the potential role of an IL-6 inhibitor to treat CME associated with non-paraneoplastic autoimmune retinopathy suggesting the role.

Sulfur Hexafluoride (SF<sub>6</sub>) versus Perfluoropropane (C<sub>3</sub>F<sub>8</sub>) in the Intraoperative Management of Macular Holes: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"To report surgical outcomes of combined vitrectomy for vitreous floaters and phacoemulsification surgery with multifocal intraocular lens implantation. Retrospective, interventional, noncomparative case series of five eyes from five patients who underwent same-day combined phacoemulsification surgeries with apodized, diffractive multifocal intraocular lens implantation for cataract and pars plana vitrectomy for symptomatic vitreous opacities, that is, floaters. Primary outcomes were distance and near visual acuities, and resolution of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included intraocular pressure, refractive outcomes, and surgical complications. Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution glare distance visual acuity improved from 0.36 (best-corrected Snellen 20/47) preoperatively to an uncorrected distance visual acuity of 0.05 (Snellen 20/23) at 6 months postoperatively (P = 0.042). All but one patient achieved multifocality with a near visual acuity of J2 or better. All patients noted subjective improvement in symptoms from floaters postoperatively. Mean intraocular pressure remained stable during follow-up. Two eyes ultimately required YAG capsulotomies for symptomatic posterior capsular opacification, one of which additionally received LASEK for refractive correction. Multifocality and improvement in symptoms from symptomatic vitreous opacities were observed in this pilot series of carefully selected patients who underwent combined phacovitrectomy with multifocal intraocular lens implantation. A high rate of retinal tears was found in these patients. Appropriate caution should be taken in preoperative assessment and patient selection for the combined procedure. "
A Japanese family with cone-rod dystrophy of delayed onset caused by a compound heterozygous combination of novel <i>CDHR1</i> frameshift and known missense variants.,"To investigate the relationship between choriocapillaris (CC) hypoperfusion and photoreceptor alterations in eyes with nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR). In this prospective, observational, case-control study, 30 eyes (30 patients) with NPDR and 30 healthy eyes from 30 controls were enrolled at the University G. d\'Annunzio, Chieti-Pescara, Italy. This study cohort underwent an ophthalmologic examination, including optical coherence tomography and optical coherence tomography angiography. The main outcome measures were as follows: 1) ""normalized"" reflectivity of en face image segmented at the ellipsoid zone level, which was calculated to quantify the photoreceptor damage, and 2) CC perfusion density. Secondary outcome measures were as follows: 1) superficial retinal capillary plexus (SCP), intermediate retinal capillary plexus (ICP), and deep retinal capillary plexus (DCP) perfusion density (based on the area of vessels); 2) SCP, ICP, and DCP vessel length density (based on a map with vessels of 1-pixel width); and 3) SCP, ICP, and DCP vessel diameter. Mean  SD age was 58.9  11.1 years (range 38-79 years) in the NPDR group and 61.7  11.3 years (range 39-87 years) in the control group (P > 0.05 for all the comparisons). Compared with controls, NPDR eyes displayed a lower ""normalized"" reflectivity (0.96  0.25 in controls and 0.73  0.19 in the NPDR group, P < 0.0001). Moreover, the NPDR group was characterized by an impaired perfusion in both the retinal and choroidal vasculature. In multiple regression analysis, ellipsoid zone ""normalized"" reflectivity displayed a significant direct association with CC perfusion density in patients with NPDR (P = 0.025 and P = 0.476, in NPDR and controls, respectively). Eyes with NPDR are affected by macular hypoperfusion and photoreceptor damage, the latter investigated as ellipsoid zone ""normalized"" reflectivity. The diabetic choroidopathy seems to be strongly associated with photoreceptor damage. "
Longitudinal changes in dry eye symptoms and signs following lifitegrast therapy and relationship to tear osmolarity.,"The relationship between age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and malignancy, especially cutaneous malignancies, is not well studied. We investigated a possible association between AMD and cutaneous malignancies. A retrospective, consecutive review of all patients who had received at least 1 intravitreal injection for wet AMD between January 1, 2004, and December 31, 2013, was conducted using the Rochester Epidemiology Project in Olmsted County, Minnesota. Age- and sex-matched control groups included 473 pre-anti-vascular endothelial growth factor era wet AMD patients, 504 concurrent time dry AMD patients, and 504 patients with no AMD. The rates of AMD and overall malignancy, cutaneous malignancies, and specific types of cutaneous malignancies were compared between groups of patients. Patients with wet AMD incurred an increased rate of overall malignancies compared to patients with dry AMD {52.8% wet AMD (confidence interval [CI]: 48.3-57.2) vs. 43.7% dry AMD (CI: 39.3-48.1); P= 0.003} or those without AMD (52.8% wet AMD [CI: 48.3-57.2] vs. 35.3% no AMD [CI: 31.1-39.7]; P = <0.001). Patients with dry AMD also had higher rates of malignancy than those without AMD (43.7% dry AMD [CI: 39.3-48.1] vs. 35.3% no AMD [CI: 31.1-39.7]; P = 0.007). Rate of cutaneous malignancies was increased in patients with wet AMD compared to patients with dry AMD (24.4% wet AMD [CI: 20.7-28.4] vs. 14.6% dry AMD [CI: 11.5-17.9]; P = <0.001) and those with no AMD (24.4% wet AMD [CI: 20.7-28.4] vs. 9.7% no AMD [CI: 7.3-12.7]; P = <0.001). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report to establish an association between AMD and cutaneous malignancies, supporting a possible discussion of the association when a patient presents with one of the two conditions.

Rapid volumetric optoacoustic imaging of neural dynamics across the mouse brain.,"Congenital Muscular Dystrophies (CMDs) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders presenting at birth with psychomotor delay, cognitive impairment, muscle weakness and hypotonia. Here we described an alteration of mitochondrial inner membrane potential and mitochondrial network in cells derived from Italian patients carrying three novel mutations in CHKB gene, recently associated with ""megaconial CMD"". On the bases of our findings, we hypothesize that the mitochondrial membrane potential alteration, presumably as a consequence of the altered biosynthesis of phosphatidylcholine, could be responsible for the peculiar morphological aspect of mitochondria in this disease and might be involved in the disease pathogenesis.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Compared with Indocyanine Green Angiography in Central Serous Chorioretinopathy.,"Attempted eye salvage for unilateral (cT2b/Group D) retinoblastoma may increase risk of tumor spread compared to primary enucleation. Identification of clinical features predictive of low histopathologic risk would support safe trial salvage. Retrospective, non-comparative single-institutional observational case series PARTICIPANTS: Children with unilateral cT2b/Group D retinoblastoma (January 2008-February 2018) managed with primary enucleation at the Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), Toronto, Canada. Data included clinical features (intraocular pressure (IOP), optic nerve obscuration, macular involvement, tumor seeding and serous retinal detachment (RD) >1 quadrant), timing to enucleation, histopathological findings and follow-up (metastasis and death). Primary outcome was low-risk (LR) (pT1/pT2) versus high-risk (HR) (pT3/pT4) (8th Edition American Joint Committee on Cancer) histopathology with Clinicopathologic correlations. Secondary outcomes were positive predictive values (probability that certain clinical features would predict LR histopathology) and negative predictive values (probability that absence of these clinical features would predict HR histopathology). Thirty-eight eyes were eligible with mean age of 21 months (range: 2-48) at diagnosis. All had vitreous seeding and normal IOP. The median diagnosis to enucleation interval was 4 days (range, 0-14) without parental refusals. Histopathology diagnosed 4/38-10.5% HR and 34/38-89.5% LR eyes. HR eyes demonstrated massive choroidal invasion (4/38-10.5%), or trans-scleral, extraocular and post-laminar optic nerve invasion (1/38-2.6%). Clinical findings included macular involvement (31/38-82%), complete optic nerve obscuration (27/38-74%), and RD (28/38-74%). The proportion of eyes with HR histopathology was 13% (4/31; 95%CI: 1- 25%) with macular involvement, 15% (4/27; 95%CI: 1-28%) with complete optic nerve obscuration, and 14% (4/28; 95%CI: 1- 27%) with RD. The predictability of LR histopathology was 100% (7/7; 95%CI: 47-100%) with macular sparing, 100% (10/10; 95%CI: 63-100%) with optic nerve visibility and 100% (10/10; 95%CI: 63-100%) with <1 quadrant of RD. One child lacking all three clinical LR predictive features had HR histopathology (pT3a) developed metastases and died; other children are alive and well (mean follow-up 65 months). Presence of macular sparing, optic-nerve visibility and/or <1 quadrant of RD predicted LR histopathology at primary enucleation, suggesting safe trial salvage. No clinical sign predicted HR histopathology. "
Development of a patient-derived xenograft model of glioblastoma via intravitreal injection in mice.,"Two similarly designed, phase 3 trials (HAWK and HARRIER) compared brolucizumab, a single-chain antibody fragment that inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor-A, with aflibercept to treat neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Double-masked, multicenter, active-controlled, randomized trials. Patients (N = 1817) with untreated, active choroidal neovascularization due to AMD in the study eye. Patients were randomized to intravitreal brolucizumab 3 mg (HAWK only) or 6 mg or aflibercept 2 mg. After loading with 3 monthly injections, brolucizumab-treated eyes received an injection every 12 weeks (q12w) and were interval-adjusted to every 8 weeks (q8w) if disease activity was present; aflibercept-treated eyes received q8w dosing. The primary hypothesis was noninferiority in mean best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) change from baseline to Week 48 (margin: 4 letters). Other key endpoints included percentage of patients who maintained q12w dosing through Week 48 and anatomical outcomes. At Week 48, each brolucizumab arm demonstrated noninferiority to aflibercept in BCVA change from baseline (least squares [LS] mean, +6.6 [6 mg] and +6.1 [3 mg] letters with brolucizumab vs +6.8 letters with aflibercept in HAWK; +6.9 [brolucizumab 6 mg] vs +7.6 [aflibercept] letters in HARRIER; P<0.001 for each comparison). Greater than 50% of brolucizumab 6 mg-treated eyes were maintained on q12w dosing through Week 48 (56% in HAWK and 51% in HARRIER). At Week 16, following identical treatment exposure, fewer brolucizumab 6 mg-treated eyes had disease activity vs aflibercept in HAWK (24.0% vs 34.5%; P=0.001) and HARRIER (22.7% vs 32.2%; P=0.002). Greater central subfield thickness reductions from baseline to Week 48 were observed with brolucizumab 6 mg vs aflibercept in HAWK (LS mean -172.8 m vs -143.7 m; P=0.001) and HARRIER (LS mean -193.8 m vs -143.9 m; P<0.001). Anatomical retinal fluid outcomes favored brolucizumab over aflibercept. Overall adverse event rates were generally similar with brolucizumab and aflibercept. Brolucizumab was noninferior to aflibercept in visual function at Week 48, and >50% of brolucizumab 6 mg-treated eyes were maintained on q12w dosing interval through Week 48. Anatomical outcomes favored brolucizumab over aflibercept. Overall safety with brolucizumab was similar to aflibercept. (ClinicalTrials.gov; NCT02307682, NCT02434328). "
Missed caterpillar cilia in the eye: cause for ongoing ocular inflammation.,"Retinal gene therapy has had unprecedented success in generating treatments that can halt vision loss. However, immunogenic response and long-term toxicity with the use of viral vectors remain a concern. Non-viral vectors are relatively non-immunogenic, scalable platforms that have limited success with DNA delivery to the eye. Messenger RNA (mRNA) therapeutics has expanded the ability to achieve high gene expression while eliminating unintended genomic integration or the need to cross the restrictive nuclear barrier. Lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) remain at the forefront of potent delivery vectors for nucleic acids. Herein, we tested eleven different LNP variants for their ability to deliver mRNA to the back of the eye. LNPs that contained ionizable lipids with low pKa and unsaturated hydrocarbon chains showed the highest amount of a reporter gene transfection in the retina. The kinetics of gene expression showed a rapid onset (within 4h) that persisted for 96h. The gene delivery was cell-type specific with majority of the expression in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE) and limited expression in the Mller glia. LNP-delivered mRNA can be used to treat monogenic retinal degenerative disorders of the RPE. The transient nature of mRNA-based therapeutics makes it desirable for applications that are directed towards retinal reprogramming or genome editing. Overall, non-viral delivery of RNA therapeutics to diverse cell types within the retina can provide transformative new approaches to prevent blindness. "
Effect of cytoglobin overexpression on extracellular matrix component synthesis in human tenon fibroblasts.,"Autosomal dominant neovascular inflammatory vitreoretinopathy (ADNIV) is a rare autoimmune condition that typically presents as progressive uveitis and vitreoretinal degeneration between the second and third decades of life. Though traditionally attributed to inherited mutations of the CAPN5 gene, few reports of de novo variants exist. This report of vision and hearing loss in a 3 year-old girl describes the youngest documented case of ADNIV due to a de novo pathogenic c.865C>T (p.Arg289Trp) CAPN5 variant, illustrating the early stages of this enigmatic disease process.

High-functioning autism spectrum disorder with fluent speech and late-onset epilepsy: an unusual presentation of Inv-Dup (15) syndrome.,"To describe the clinical and Anterior Segment Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography (AS-SS OCT) findings in Bilateral Acute Depigmentation of the Iris (BADI). Retrospective descriptive study of three clinical cases. Three women diagnosed with BADI shared a history of bacterial infections treated with moxifloxacin. The AS-SS OCT showed damage from the collarette to the root of the iris, without affecting the pupillary area. In the affected areas, the anterior edge had lost its homogeneous hyper-reflectivity. The stroma was thinned and showed a patchy and diffused hyper-reflectivity. The pigmentary epithelium appeared unaffected. AS-SS OCT findings, not previously described, locate the damage in BADI in the anterior edge and iridian stroma, areas which are rich in melanocytes and permeable to aqueous humor. "
Neuro-Behet's syndrome with a severe ocular lesion.,To assess the efficacy and safety of systemic interferon alpha-2a (IFN) for refractory pseudophakic cystoid macular edema (PCME). Retrospective observational study. The primary outcome was the decrease of central retinal thickness (CRT). Secondary endpoints were the improvement of best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and the assessment of IFN-related side effects. Twenty-four eyes of 20 patients were included. The median CRT was 513 m (range 220-980 m) at baseline and decreased to 190 m (range 140-520 m) at the last follow-up visit (p < 0.001). Reduction of CRT greater than 100 m was observed in 22 eyes (92%). The median BCVA (logMAR) increased statistically significant from 0.5 (range 0.2-1.5) at baseline to 0.3 (0-0.8) at the last follow-up (p < 0.001). The BCVA improved in 18 eyes (75%) and remained stable in five eyes (21%). No severe treatment-related side effects occurred. IFN is a very effective agent for treatment of refractory PCME. 
Changes in corneal expression of MUC5AC after autologous serum eyedrop treatment in patients with limbal stem cell deficiency.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of a novel topical cyclosporin A 0.05% nanoemulsion in comparison with a conventional emulsion in primary Sjgren's syndrome dry eyes. Prospective, randomized, double-blinded study was conducted. Corneal and conjunctival staining score was improved in both groups, with a faster change noted in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05). Tear film break-up time was significantly improved in the nanoemulsion group at 12 weeks (p < 0.05), while ocular surface disease index score was improved in both groups without a difference at 12 weeks. Schirmer I value and goblet cell grade did not change in both groups. IL-6 and MMP-9 were significantly decreased in both groups at 12 weeks. Both nanoemulsion and conventional cyclosporin A improved ocular signs, symptoms, and conjunctival inflammation. However, the novel cyclosporin A nanoemulsion showed faster improvement of ocular surface staining scores than the conventional emulsion. "
Usher syndrome in a patient with Ellis-van Creveld syndrome.,"The execution of resistance exercise against heavy loads promotes an acute intraocular pressure (IOP) rise, which has detrimental effects on ocular health. However, the effect of load on the IOP behavior during exercise remains unknown due to technical limitations. IOP monitoring during isometric squat exercise permits assessment of IOP behavior during physical effort. Second, greater loads will induce a higher IOP rise. Randomized cross-sectional study. Level 2. Twenty-six young adults (13 women, 13 men) performed an isometric squat exercise against 3 loads relative to their maximum capacity (low, medium, and high). IOP was measured before, during (1 measurement every 6 seconds), and after exercise (10 seconds of recovery). There was a progressive IOP rise during exercise, which was dependent on the load applied (Bayes factor<sub>10</sub> >100). Higher IOP values were found in the high load condition in comparison with the medium (mean IOP difference = 1.5 mm Hg) and low (mean IOP difference = 3.1 mm Hg) conditions, as well as when the medium load was compared with the low load condition (mean IOP difference = 1.6 mm Hg). Men reached higher IOP values in comparison with women during the last measurements in the high load condition. Ten seconds of recovery were enough to obtain IOP values similar to baseline levels. Isometric squat exercise induces an immediate and cumulative IOP elevation, which is positively associated with the load applied. These IOP increments return to baseline values after 10 seconds of recovery, and men demonstrate a more accentuated IOP rise in comparison with women when high levels of effort are accumulated. These findings may help in better management of different ocular conditions and highlight the importance of an individualized exercise prescription in clinical populations. "
Prevalence of childhood ocular morbidity in a peri-urban setting in Bangladesh: a community-based study.,"The aim of the present study was to demonstrate novel findings recognized within the basement membrane of the anterior lens capsules (aLCs) in exfoliation syndrome, in a transmission electron microscopy (TEM) study. Twenty one patients with age-related cataract were included in the study. Eleven out of them suffered from exfoliation syndrome (XFS). Anterior lens capsules were obtained from patients during phacoemulsification, applying continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis and then were examined by transmission electron microscope. Six out of eleven examined basement membranes with XFS had a granular appearance with dotted deposits of electron dense material. Fibrils were clearly detected, longitudinally, within the basement membrane, usually located in the outer quarter of the basement membrane, towards the anterior chamber. New data about the exfoliation material and its location within the basement membrane of the anterior lens capsules of XFS patients are presented. These findings constitute new evidence for XFS's histopathogenesis and might help clarify the lenticular exfoliation material's (XFM) mechanisms of origin. "
Quantitative fundus autofluorescence in smokers compared to non-smokers.,"Dry eye disease (DED) is an increasingly common condition and one of the most common complaints of patients. The vast majority of DED is caused by the so-called ""evaporative"" subtype, that is mainly caused by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Intense pulsed light (IPL) devices employ high intensity pulses of polychromatic lights with a broad range of wavelength (515-1200 nm). IPL treatment has been utilized for years in the field of dermatology, and then its use was applied to ophthalmology for the treatment of MGD. Recently, a new device employing IPL was specifically designed for the periocular application. This procedure determines the thermal selective coagulation and ablation of superficial blood vessels and telangiectasias of the eyelids skin, reducing the release of inflammatory mediators and tear cytokines levels, and improving meibomian glands outflow. IPL treatment is noninvasive and easy to perform, lasts for only a few minutes and can be conducted in an office setting. In the present study, 19 patients underwent 3 sessions of IPL treatment. After treatment, both mean noninvasive break-up time and lipid layer thickness grade significantly increased, as a result of an improvement of tear film stability and quality, respectively. Conversely, no statistically significant changes were found for meibomian gland loss and tear osmolarity. Furthermore, the vast majority of the treated patients (17/19; 89.5% of the total) perceived an improvement of their ocular discomfort symptoms after IPL treatment. Although IPL treatment provides an improvement of both ocular surface parameters and ocular discomfort symptoms after one cycle of three sessions, regular repeated treatments are usually required to maintain the persistence over the time of its beneficial effects.

NOVEL SURGICAL TECHNIQUE TO REMOVE RETAINED SUBFOVEAL PERFLUOROCARBON LIQUID.,"Dry eye (DE) is a common type of ocular surface disease that affects many people. Moxibustion has been widely used in China to treat ocular surface diseases, especially DE. Many clinical trials have demonstrated that moxibustion can increase the tear secretion quantity and improve tear film stability. The purpose of this review is to provide an objective and normative systematic review to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion treatment in patients with DE. The systematic review will include all of the randomized controlled trials on the effectiveness and safety of moxibustion for DE. Nine medical databases, namely PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal database (VIP), Wanfang Database, and CBM, will be searched from the date of the database inception to February 28, 2019. We will also search registers of clinical trials, potential gray literature, and conference abstracts. There are no restrictions on language and publication status. Two reviewers will independently select studies, and extract and manage data. The reporting quality and risk of bias will be assessed by other 2 review authors. The primary outcomes will include ocular surface disease index (OSDI) scores, Schirmer test (SIT) results, tear meniscus height (TMH), and tear break-up time (TBUT) values. Quality of life, the main symptom scores before and after treatment, meibomian gland (MG) morphology, total treatment efficacy, and safety will be evaluated as the secondary outcomes. We will use RevMan V.5.3 software to synthesize and analyze data. This systematic review will provide a comprehensive review of current evidence of moxibustion for DE from the following aspects: the OSDI, SIT, TMH, BUT, quality of life, the main symptom scores, MG morphology, total treatment efficacy, and safety. The conclusion of our systematic review will provide evidence to determine whether moxibustion is an effective and safe intervention for patients with DE. Since patients will not be involved in this study, it is not necessary to obtain ethical approval. The protocol and results will be published in a peer-reviewed journal. PROSPERO CRD42018097399. "
FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE PREDICTING GROWTH OF A CHOROIDAL OSTEOMA IN A 13-YEAR-OLD GIRL.,"Stargardt disease is the most common inherited juvenile macular dystrophy and is characterized by yellowish flecks across the posterior pole. The purpose of this study was to investigate fluorescence lifetime changes of retinal flecks over time using fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscopy. Longitudinal fluorescence lifetime data of 12 patients with Stargardt disease (mean age  SEM, 42.25  2.1 years; range, 28-58 years) were acquired using a fluorescence lifetime imaging ophthalmoscope based on a Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis system. Retinal autofluorescence was excited with a 470-nm laser. The emitted fluorescence was detected in two wavelength channels: a short spectral channel (498-560 nm) and a long spectral channel (560-720 nm). The mean retinal autofluorescence lifetimes were calculated and further analyzed with corresponding color fundus images, autofluorescence intensity images, and spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Patients were classified into three subtypes. All patients with Stargardt disease displayed characteristic autofluorescence lifetime patterns. Mean fluorescence lifetime values within areas of yellow flecks were significantly prolonged (long spectral channel 484 ps) compared with the surrounding tissue (long spectral channel 297 ps). In 91.6% of the eyes, flecks with short fluorescence lifetimes (long spectral channel 255 ps) were identified. Short lifetime flecks progressed to flecks with characteristic long lifetimes in 75.1% of eyes within a mean interval of 29.2 months (range 3-45 months). Between baseline and follow-up, the rate of newly developed short lifetime flecks (number/per year) based on subtypes was 2.62 in Group 1, 1.43 in Group 2, and 0.81 in Group 3. Recent onset flecks in Stargardt disease display short fluorescence lifetimes and convert into longer fluorescence lifetime flecks over time. This transition may represent a change in the composition of retinal deposits with accumulation of lipofuscin and retinoid by-products from the visual cycle. With emerging treatment options, these findings may prove useful to monitor disease progression and therapeutic effects.This is an open access article distributed under the Creative Commons Attribution License 4.0 (CCBY), which permits unrestricted use, distribution, and reproduction in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited.

Age-related course of visual acuity obtained with ETDRS 2000 charts in persons with healthy eyes.,"Corneal confocal microscopy (CCM) is an imaging method to detect loss of nerve fibers in the cornea. The impact of image quality on the CCM parameters has not been investigated. We developed a quality index (QI) with 3 stages for CCM images and compared the influence of the image quality on the quantification of corneal nerve parameters using 2 modes of analysis in healthy volunteers and patients with known peripheral neuropathy. Images of 75 participants were a posteriori analyzed, including 25 each in 3 image quality groups (QI 1-QI 3). Corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL) was analyzed using automated and semiautomated software, and corneal nerve fiber density and corneal nerve branch density were quantified using automated image analysis. Three masked raters assessed CCM image quality (QI) independently and categorized images into groups QI 1-QI 3. In addition, statistical analysis was used to compare interrater reliability. Analysis of variance was used for analysis between the groups. Interrater reliability analysis between the image ratings was performed by calculating Fleiss' kappa and its 95% confidence interval. CNFL, corneal nerve fiber density, and corneal nerve branch density increased significantly with QI (P < 0.001, all post hoc tests P < 0.05). CNFL was higher using semiautomated compared with automated nerve analysis, independent of QI. Fleiss kappa coefficient for interrater reliability of QI was 0.72. The quantification of corneal nerve parameters depends on image quality, and poorer quality images are associated with lower values for corneal nerve parameters. We propose the QI as a tool to reduce variability in quantification of corneal nerve parameters. "
Characterization of Blau syndrome panuveitis with wide-field fluorescein angiography.,"Despite increasing information in the literature regarding congenital Zika infection, gaps remain in our knowledge of its clinical manifestations. We did a prospective observational study of exposed fetuses and infants whose mothers developed symptomatic and confirmed Zika infection during pregnancy in Valle del Cauca, Colombia. We performed neurological, ophthalmological and audiological evaluations, and classified outcomes as possibly or uncertainly related to Zika. Frequencies of outcomes were compared according to the trimester of pregnancy when infection occurred. We evaluated 171 products of gestation including 17 pregnancy losses and 154 patients evaluated postnatally. Ninety (52.6%) pregnancies presented an adverse outcome, 36% possibly related with Zika and the remaining 64% of uncertain relation. Infection in the first trimester had the highest frequencies of adverse outcomes possibly related with Zika compared with the second and third trimesters (39% vs. 12.5% vs. 12%) with risk ratios of adverse outcomes possibly related to Zika in pregnancies infected in the first versus second or third trimester of 3.1 (95% CI: 2.4-4.1) and 3.3 (95% CI: 2.5-4.2), respectively. The frequencies of pregnancy loss and microcephaly were 9.4% and 4.5%, respectively. Auditory and ophthalmic abnormalities possibly related with Zika were present in 3% and 6% of the patients evaluated, respectively. We observed a high frequency of gestational and neonatal complications in pregnant women who acquired Zika infection, especially in early pregnancy, resulting in a broad spectrum of clinical manifestations. Preventive measures are urgently needed to reduce the clinical burden during future Zika outbreaks. "
Primary Acquired Toxoplasma Retinochoroiditis: Choroidal Neovascular Membrane as an Early Complication.,"To evaluate the clinical characteristics, outcomes, and adverse reactions after the use of lifitegrast 5% ophthalmic solution for the treatment of patients with dry eye disease (DED). Retrospective chart review was performed in 121 patients seen at the Duke Eye Center with DED who were prescribed lifitegrast 5% and seen for follow-up after treatment initiation. Charts were reviewed for meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading, conjunctival and corneal staining scores, and tear breakup time (TBUT), as well as matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) levels. Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) questionnaire scores and self-reported adverse reactions were also assessed. The average patient age was 60.5 years (range, 22-88 years); 87.6% were female, and 20.7% had a previous autoimmune disease diagnosis. Of the 54 eyes with an initial positive MMP-9, 21 eyes (38.9%) normalized after treatment. The ocular symptoms OSDI subscore demonstrated an improvement of -2.436.85 (P=0.011) after treatment. Corneal staining scores showed an average change of -0.15 (P=0.007). The average change in TBUT was 1.9 sec (P<0.001). Self-reported adverse reactions were noted in 31.4% of patients. There was no statistically significant change in MGD grading. Patients with moderate-severe DED showed statistically significant improvements in conjunctival and corneal staining scores and TBUT (-0.170.66, P=0.0442; -0.540.65, P<0.001; +2.022.63, P=0.004, respectively). Lifitegrast 5% is a useful therapeutic option for DED with a moderate proportion of self-reported adverse reactions, all of which were related to ocular discomfort. Treatment with lifitegrast was associated with statistically significant improvements in MMP-9 levels, ocular symptoms, corneal staining, and TBUT. "
Correlation Between <i>Dysphagia</i> and Malocclusion in Rett Syndrome: A preliminary study.,"To report a patient with chronic ocular graft versus host disease who achieved long-term stability of a descemetocele using prosthetic replacement of the ocular surface ecosystem (PROSE) treatment. Case report and literature review. A 60-year-old white man, who underwent PROSE treatment 4 years earlier to address severe dry eyes secondary to ocular graft versus host disease, developed a central corneal ulcer that resulted in descemetocele formation. Because of the risks of surgical intervention in an immunocompromised patient with severe ocular surface disease, the descemetocele was monitored closely as the patient continued PROSE device wear. After 1 year with continued PROSE therapy, the patient's descemetocele remained stable without perforation and corrected visual acuity stabilized at 20/50 in the affected eye. This is the first case that reports stabilization of a descemetocele with a PROSE device. For patients at high risk for postsurgical complications, PROSE treatment could be considered as an alternative to corneal transplantation and as an adjunct to other ocular therapies in patients with descemetocele formation.

"Maximum Oxygen Uptake of Male Soccer Players According to their Competitive Level, Playing Position and Age Group: Implication from a Network Meta-Analysis.","To compare the repeatability and agreement between a swept-source biometer and a Scheimpflug biometer in cataract patients. Three consecutive measurements were obtained using a swept-source biometer (IOLMaster 700) and a Scheimpflug biometer (AL-Scan) in 52 eyes of 52 patients. Keratometry, central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), axial length, and white-to-white (WTW) distance were recorded. Astigmatism values were transformed into vector components of J0 and J45. Intraoperator repeatability was analyzed using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and reproducibility coefficients (RCs). Agreement of measurements between the two devices was evaluated using the Bland-Altman method. The IOLMaster 700 showed higher ICCs and lower RCs for the mean keratometry (Km) (P0.018), CCT (P0.027), and ACD (P0.001) measurements, whereas the AL-Scan showed higher ICC and lower RC for the J45 vector component of astigmatism at the 2.4-mm zone (P0.034). Both the devices had excellent repeatability (ICC=0.999) in axial length measurement. Systematic differences were found in Km, CCT, ACD, and WTW (P0.018) between the devices. The mean difference for Km was -0.196 and -0.144 D measured at the 2.4-mm zone and 3.3-mm zone, respectively. The corresponding mean difference for CCT, ACD, and WTW distance was 14.92 m, -0.017 mm, and 0.283 mm, respectively. These differences led to a statistically significant but clinically insignificant difference in the prediction of intraocular lens power. This study showed significant differences in anterior segment measurement repeatability and agreement between a swept-source biometer and a Scheimpflug biometer in eyes with cataract. "
Role of inflammatory factors in the effects of aflibercept or ranibizumab treatment for alleviating wet age-associated macular degeneration.,"To evaluate the preliminary clinical outcomes of a new contact lens design for orthokeratology in hyperopia. Prospective pilot study including 8 hyperopic eyes of 4 nonpresbyopic patients (24-44 years) undergoing orthokeratology with the Alexa H contact lens (Tiedra Pharmaceutical, Madrid, Spain), which is an aspheric pentacurve design. Visual, refractive, corneal topographic, and aberrometric changes were evaluated during a 1-month follow-up. Likewise, the presence of ocular surface alterations was evaluated by slit-lamp biomicroscopy during this follow-up. Mean noncyclopegic sphere decreased significantly from a mean prefitting value of 2.940.95 D to mean values of 1.181.19 (P=0.01) and 0.250.85 D (P=0.04) at 1 week and 1 month of lens wear, respectively. Statistically significant changes were detected at 1 week of use of the lenses in keratometry (P=0.03), asphericity (Q) (P=0.01), and the Zernike term for corneal spherical aberration (SA) (P=0.01). However, no significant changes were observed in uncorrected (P=0.68) and best-corrected distance visual acuity (P=0.18). Superficial corneal staining was observed after the first night of use in only 1 patient who was resolved spontaneously. Likewise, the induction of a ""toroid-like"" topographic pattern leading to poor visual outcome and suboptimal correction was observed in four eyes at the beginning of the treatment. This condition was solved in all cases by reducing the lens diameter. The Alexa H lens seems to be useful for providing an orthokeratologic correction of hyperopia, with generation of increased negative Q and SA, and central steepening. However, fitting guides must be improved to avoid suboptimal outcomes as those related to the ""toroid-like"" topographic pattern defined. "
Electrospun gelatin/PCL and collagen/PCL scaffolds for modulating responses of bone marrow endothelial progenitor cells.,"Retinal microvascular disease reflects, in part, poor blood pressure control and systemic microvascular disease contributes to renal failure progression. This study examined the retinal microvasculature in Alport syndrome. Retinal images from 28 males and 28 females with X-linked Alport syndrome, and 13 individuals with autosomal recessive disease were reviewed retrospectively for microvascular/ hypertensive retinopathy (Wong and Mitchell classification), and small vessel calibre (using a computerised semiautomated method and revised Knudtson formula). Data were compared with age and gender-matched individuals with normal blood pressure andrenal function. Microvascular/hypertensive retinopathy was more common in males and females with X-linked Alport syndrome than age- and gender-matched controls (23, 82% and 10, 36%, p <0.01; and 21, 75% and 13, 48%, p =0.05, respectively), and in individuals with autosomal recessive disease compared with controls (12, 92% and 16, 43%, p <0.01). Moderate microvascular/hypertensive changes were present in males and females with X-linked or autosomal recessive disease but not controls. Arteriolar calibre was reduced in males with X-linked disease (142.518.7m, and 150.710.1m, p =0.046) and in autosomal recessive disease (133.511.10m and 149.110.6m, p <0.0001). Microvascular/hypertensive retinopathy and arteriolar narrowing in males with X-linked disease were not different after renal transplantation and before (p NS). Microvascular/hypertensive retinopathy was more common and more severe in Alport syndrome than normotensive controls. Improved BP levels may further slow the rate of renal functional decline in Alport syndrome. "
Limbal niche cells can reduce the angiogenic potential of cultivated oral mucosal epithelial cells.,"Horizontal gaze palsy and progressive scoliosis (HGPPS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder due to mutations in ROBO3 gene. Patients have characteristic clinical and imaging findings. We report six patients from two families with this disorder with two novel mutations. One patient from a non-consanguineous family and five patients from extended consanguineous families were clinically and radiologically examined. Blood samples from the patients and their parents were obtained and all the coding exons and flanking intronic sequences of the ROBO3 gene were amplified and subjected to bidirectional DNA sequencing. All six patients had the characteristic clinical and radiological findings of HGPPS. Genetic testing showed two novel mutations including frame-shift and nonsense. Two novel mutations in the ROBO3 gene were identified in two Jordanian families with six affected individuals. To our knowledge, this is the first molecular study of HGPPS in Jordan. "
Identification of prothymosin alpha (PTMA) as a biomarker for esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) by label-free quantitative proteomics and Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB).,"Optical coherence tomography angiography is a relatively new, noninvasive technology that has revolutionized imaging of the retinal and choroidal microvasculature. This technology is based on the detection of movement or changes that represent moving red cells in sequential optical coherence tomography scans. As with other established imaging technologies, it has unique benefits as well as certain disadvantages, which include a limited field of view and vulnerability to imaging artifacts. However, software and hardware improvements are continually evolving to mitigate these limitations. Optical coherence tomography angiography has been used to gain a better understanding of microvascular changes across a spectrum of ocular diseases including diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration, glaucoma, and retinal vein occlusions. In this article, we review algorithms and techniques commonly utilized in optical coherence tomography angiography systems and compare optical coherence tomography angiography to fluorescein angiography, the current gold standard for imaging the retinal vasculature. In addition, we provide an overview of important optical coherence tomography angiography findings in a variety of ocular diseases. Although the clinical role of this technology is still poorly defined, optical coherence tomography angiography has the potential to become an invaluable tool in the diagnosis and monitoring of vascular pathologies.

Patient-reported outcomes of ocriplasmin for the treatment of vitreomacular traction: a systematic review and synthesis of the literature.,"Relentless placoid chorioretinitis (RPC) is a new disease concept that was proposed by Jones et al. in 2000. Some cases of RPC have been reported; however, a treatment strategy has not yet been established. We report herein four cases of patients diagnosed with RPC. We experienced four cases of RPC in patients aged 24-51 years. All patients exhibited retinal lesions similar to that seen in acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy or serpiginous choroiditis from the posterior pole to the surrounding region. Although patients underwent systemic prednisolone (PSL) therapy, recurrence was observed and the retinal scar formation was progressive; they were then diagnosed with RPC. In all cases, cyclosporine (CyA) was administered in addition to PSL, no recurrence was observed thereafter. RPC is a rare disease, and a treatment strategy has not yet been established. CyA and PSL combination therapy is considered to be effective in the treatment of RPC. "
Outcome of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty for graft failure after Descemet stripping automated endothelial keratoplasty.,"The inter-visit variation of measuring bulbar conjunctival microvasculature and microcirculation needs to be considered when the results from multiple visits are interpreted. This study examined the inter-visit variability of measuring conjunctival microvasculature and microcirculation in habitual contact lens (HCL) wearers and non-contact lens (NCL) wearers. Twenty-eight subjects were recruited including 13 HCL wearers (10 females and 3 males; mean agestandard deviation, 25.84.6years) who had worn contact lenses on a daily basis for at least 3years and 15NCL wearers (10 females and 5 males, age 25.54.0years) were recruited. The temporal bulbar conjunctiva was imaged using a functional slit-lamp bio-microscope (FSLB) imaging system. FSLB imaging was performed in the morning when the HCL wearers did not wear their lenses. The measurements included conjunctival vessel diameter, vessel density, blood flow velocity and flow volume. In addition, conjunctival microvasculature was analyzed using monofractal (Dbox, representing vessel density) and multifractal (D0 representing vessel complexity) analyses. The repeated measurement was conducted at least one week after the first visit and both eyes of each participant were imaged. The coefficient of variation (CV) was calculated as the standard deviation of the differences between test and re-test then divided by the mean of the measurements. The intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) was also calculated. No significant differences of all vascular measurements in both the right and left eyes were found between two groups (<i>P</i>>0.05). Between two measurements on two different visits, the CV was from 2.4% (vessel density D0) to 63.5% (blood flow volume Q) in HCL wearers and from 3.4% (D0) to 40.6% (blood flow volume) in NCL wearers. The ICC was from 0.60 (vessel diameter) to 0.81 (axial blood flow velocity VA) in HCL wearers and from 0.44 (Q) to 0.68 (cross-sectional blood flow velocity VS) in NCL wearers. The measurement variability of the vessel density of the bulbar conjunctiva appeared to have the smallest inter-visit variation. The measurement variability of the vasculature and circulation in HCL wearers were similar to that in NCL wearers. "
Hypoxia tolerance in the Norrin-deficient retina and the chronically hypoxic brain studied at single-cell resolution.,"Metatropic dysplasia (MD) is a rare skeletal dysplasia associated with heterozygous mutations in the <i>TRPV4</i> gene. We describe a 28-month-old boy with knock-knees referred for metabolic investigation suspected of carrying vitamin D-resistant rickets. He has received regular vitamin D prophylaxis at the usual dose. Laboratory investigations revealed normal values for calcium, phosphorus and alkaline phosphatase. He was short (-3.5 SDS), his mental development was normal, and he started to walk at the age of 22 months. The diagnostic clue for the diagnosis of metatropic dysplasia was the presence of the hump back in the upper lumbar and lower thoracic vertebrae, in addition to a long and narrow chest. An X-ray survey of the skeleton revealed platyspondyly, dysplastic metaphyses with dumbbell appearance of the long bones, kyphoscoliosis, and narrow and elongated thorax with short ribs. This is the first patient with MD in the Republic of Macedonia. Knock-knees were the cause of his referral, as a peculiarity of his phenotype. The very presence of the hump back, and the dumbbell appearance of the long bones distinguished the MD from other bone dysplasias with similar characteristics. We believe that the presence of those two features can shorten the path to accurate diagnosis in the crowded field of overlapping skeletal dysplasias. The diagnosis of MD in this patient was further confirmed by the discovery of the mutation c.2396C>T; p.Pro799Leu (P799L) of the <i>TRPV4</i> gene. "
Doubles trouble-85 cases of ocular trauma in badminton: clinical features and prevention.,"<b>Objective:</b> Traumatic superior orbital fissure syndrome is a rare complication that occurs in association with craniofacial trauma. In the present case, there were no associated orbital fractures or other lesions to explain. <b>Methods:</b> We present a-16-year-old patient with total ophthalmoplegia, ptosis, and anesthesia of the upper eyelid and forehead 6 hours after a reported trauma to the left eye. We measured the width of the superior orbital fissure on the horizontal plane including the optic canal using computed tomography scans. <b>Results:</b> Radiological examinations did not reveal any orbital fractures. However, the superior orbital fissure on the affected side was only 1.86 mm, increasing susceptibility to indirect trauma. <b>Conclusions:</b> A narrow superior orbital fissure may play a role for superior orbital fissure syndrome altering the transmitted force from the trauma and edema.

"The efficacy and safety of Sipjeondaebo-tang in Korean patients with cold hypersensitivity in the hands and feet: a protocol for a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial.","Stargardt disease (STGD) and age-related macular degeneration (AMD) share clinical and pathophysiological features. In AMD, macular hyperpigmentary changes are associated to a worse prognosis. The purpose of this study was to characterize macular hyperpigmentary changes in patients with STGD and associate them with the severity of phenotype. This retrospective cross-sectional studyincluded 141 patients with STGD. Hyperpigmentary changes were evaluated on color fundus photography and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. Severity of phenotype was assessed by full-field electroretinogram (ffERG) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) patterns, and visual acuity (VA). Thirty patients (21.7%) showed macular hyperpigmentary changes in four distinct patterns. Out of seventeen patients who had follow-up images, eleven patients demonstrated increases of the hyperpigmented lesions, and progression of the underlying RPE atrophy overtime. VA remained stable. Of 28 patients who had ffERG, 17 patients presented with reduction of photopic and scotopic responses, while 8 presented with reduction of photopic responses only, and 3 presented with preserved photopic and scotopic responses. Of 25 patients who had FAF available, 12 presented with widespread disease extending anteriorly to the vascular arcades, while eight presented with widespread disease, extending beyond the vascular arcades, and 5 presented with disease confined to the foveal area. In this study, we demonstrated that patients with STGD with macular hyperpigmented lesions had a severe phenotype. Overtime, hyperpigmented lesions increased in size, spread across the retina, and migrated to different retinal layers. Macular hyperpigmentation may be a marker of advanced stage of the disease. "
Bilateral mantle cell lymphoma of the ciliary body that responded to a combined local radiotherapy and chemotherapy regimen: a case report.,"Limb spasms are phenomena of hyperreflexia that occur after spinal cord injury. Currently, the clinical treatment is less than ideal. Our goal is to develop a combination therapy based on individualized medicine to reduce spasticity after spinal cord injury. In this study, rats received a severe contusive injury at the T9 segment of the spinal cord, followed by gene therapy with adenoassociated virus encoding human neurotrophic factor 3 (AAV-NT3) and a 2-week exercise program starting at 4 weeks after injury. We quantified the frequency of spasms during a swimming test at 4 and 6 weeks after injury and confirmed the results of the swimming test by measuring the H-reflex of the plantar muscle. We obtained weekly hind limb exercise scores to assess the effect of the interventions in hind limb motor function improvement. Then, we used immunofluorescence to observe the immunoreactivity of spinal motor neurons, synaptophysin, cholinergic interneurons, and GABAergic interneurons. We also measured the expression of KCC2 in the spinal cord by western blot. We found that AAV-NT3 gene therapy, exercise, and combination therapy all attenuated the frequency of spasms in the swimming test conducted at 6 weeks after spinal cord injury and increased rate-dependent depression of H-reflex. Combination therapy was significantly superior to AAV-NT3 alone in protecting motor neurons. Recovery of KCC2 expression was significantly greater in rats treated with combination therapy than in the exercise group. Combination therapy was also significantly superior to individual therapies in remodeling spinal cord neurons. Our study shows that the combination of AAV-NT3 gene therapy and exercise can alleviate muscle spasm after spinal cord injury by altering the excitability of spinal interneurons and motor neurons. However, combination therapy did not show a significant additive effect, which needs to be improved by adjusting the combined strategy. "
Hyaluronic Acid Combined with Serum Rich in Growth Factors in Corneal Epithelial Defects.,"Behcet's disease (BD) is a chronic systemic inflammatory vasculitis of unknown etiology characterized by recurrent episodes of oral aphthous ulcers, genital ulcers, skin lesions, ocular lesions, and other manifestations. Although the pathogenesis of BD is unclear, some studies have shown that immunological aberrations play an important role in the development and progression of BD. Infection-related trigger factors, including antigens and autoantigens, are believed to mediate the development of BD in patients with a genetic predisposition and subsequently activate the innate and adaptive immune systems, resulting in the production of numerous cytokines and chemokines to combat the infection-related factors. The study of the immunological mechanism of BD paves the way for the development of innovative therapies. Recently, novel biotherapy approaches, including interferon- (IFN-), tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) antagonists, and other agents that target interleukins and their receptors, have shown promising results in the treatment of patients with refractory BD and have improved the prognosis of BD. In this review, we provide the current concepts of BD immunopathogenesis. "
The protective variant rs7173049 at LOXL1 locus impacts on retinoic acid signaling pathway in pseudoexfoliation syndrome.,"Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) usually presents as unilateral and has acute onset. In Arab population, the proportion of open- and closed-angle glaucoma is similar. To the best of our knowledge, chronic PACG in very young age is rare. We share a case report of a teenage girl with advanced glaucomatous changes and, on gonioscopy, had synechia and closed angle of anterior chamber. She was treated by bilateral laser iridotomy and topical glaucoma medication. The author concludes that, even at very young age, in the absence of predisposing factors for secondary glaucoma, the patient should be investigated for PACG and managed accordingly. "
SARILUMAB FOR RECALCITRANT CYSTOID MACULAR EDEMA IN NON-PARANEOPLASTIC AUTOIMMUNE RETINOPATHY.,"Retinoblastoma is the most common intraocular malignancy in children. The aim of this study was to investigate the efficacy and toxicity of combination ifosfamide, carboplatin, etoposide, and vincristine (ICEV) in advanced-stage pediatric retinoblastoma [International Classification of Retinoblastoma (ICRB) group D or E], and in ICRB group C in the second eye in simultaneously treated bilateral retinoblastoma. The medical records of retinoblastoma patients treated with concurrent ICEV regimen and focal therapy were retrospectively reviewed. The ICEV treatment protocol was, as follows: ifosfamide 1800mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1-3; MESNA 600mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1-3; carboplatin 560mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1; etoposide 150mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Days 1-3; and vincristine 1.5mg/m<sup>2</sup> on Day 1. Of 16 retinoblastoma patients, 13 had bilateral disease. Seven first eyes in bilateral disease that were enucleated prior to ICEV therapy were excluded. Twenty-two eyes were finally included (six group C, six group D, and ten group E). Median follow-up was 3.4years, and the median number of ICEV courses was 7. Fifteen globes could be salvaged, 12 responded to ICEV (six group C, five group D, and one group E), and three unresponsive eyes could be salvaged with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). Enucleation-free and relapse-free survival was 68.2 and 54.5%, respectively. The results of this study suggest ICEV as an alternative therapeutic approach for globe salvage in pediatric retinoblastoma, especially in ICRB groups C and D with manageable acute toxicity. Further study in larger cohort is needed to confirm the effectiveness of treatment. "
COMBINED PHACOEMULSIFICATION SURGERY WITH MULTIFOCAL INTRAOCULAR LENS IMPLANTATION AND PARS PLANA VITRECTOMY FOR SYMPTOMATIC VITREOUS OPACITIES.,"Purpose/Aim: Dry eye disease (DED), common and suboptimally treated, is in need of novel animal models to understand its pathophysiology and assess the efficacy and other parameters of new pharmacological agents for its treatment. The more than 10 rabbit models of DED described to date have significant limitations including induction of mild disease, lack of consistency, and off-target effects when chemical agents are used for disease induction. Our aim was to develop a new model of chronic DED in rabbits that overcomes the limitations of existing models. We performed a complete surgical resection of all orbital lacrimal glands (LGs; dacryoadenectomy) in normal adult New Zealand White rabbits. One week after removal of the nictitating membrane, we surgically removed the orbital superior LG, followed by removal of the palpebral superior LG, and finally removal of the inferior LG. Surgery was performed under anesthesia, required about 1 h/eye, and was well-tolerated. Dacryoadenectomy induced severe DED, evidenced by >90% reduction in the tear break up time test, 50% reduction in the Schirmer tear test, 10% increase in tear osmolarity, and a marked increase in the rose bengal staining score. DED was sustained and essentially unchanged for the eight weeks of observation. Sham-operated rabbits showed no such changes, with the exception of a non-significant and transient reduction in the tear break up time test, a response to ocular surgery. This model of stable, chronic, predominantly aqueous-deficient DED recapitulates key clinical and histological features of human DED and is suitable for the study of ocular surface homeostasis, of the pathophysiology of DED, and of the efficacy of candidate drugs for DED treatment. "
PHOTORECEPTOR DAMAGE IN DIABETIC CHOROIDOPATHY.,"The aim of this study is to compare the efficacy of intravitreal injection of Aflibercept and Ranibizumab in the treatment of naive diabetic macular edema (DME) with serous retinal detachment (SRD). In this prospective, non- randomized-cohort study, 60 eyes with DME with SRD were divided into two groups: group1 consisted of 30 eyes treated with intravitreal injection of 0.5 mg/0.1 mL Ranibizumab (IVR) and group2 consisted of 30 eyes treated with intravitreal injection of 2 mg/0.05 mL Aflibercept (IVA). After three sequential injections with 30-40 day interval as a loading dose, all patients were followed up for 12 months. The best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central macular thickness (CMT), SRD'height (SRDH) and the number of re-injections of the drugs were compared. The groups were similar in terms of age and sex (p>0.05). There was no difference between groups in terms of the baseline BCVA, CMT and SRDH (p>0.05). There was no significant difference between groups with regard to BCVA and CMT values for 12 month (p>0.05). SRDH decreased significantly in both groups, however the reduction of SRDH was considerably higher in group 2 for 12 months (p<0.05). The mean number of re-injection was 4.40  0.85 in group1 and 3.16  0.75 in group2 and it was noticeably lower in group 2 (p<0.001). The number of cases with persistent SRD at the end of the study was 14 (46.6%) in group 1 and 5 (16.6%) in group 2 (p<0.001). Aflibercept may treate SRD more efficiently in patients with DME compared to Ranibizumab with fewer injections. "
INCREASED INCIDENCE OF CUTANEOUS KERATINOCYTIC AND MELANOCYTIC MALIGNANCIES IN PATIENTS WITH AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.,"To evaluate qualitative optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and quantitative parameters, such as central macular thickness (CMT) and subfoveolar choroidal thickness (SFCT), in the eyes of preeclamptic women. The prospective, comparative, cross-sectional study included 52 eyes of 52 preeclamptic (PE) women and 54 eyes of 54 healthy pregnant women in their second or third trimester. Central macular thickness (CMT), subfoveolar choroidal thickness (SFCT), were evaluated in relation to presence of positive qualitative OCT findings such as any subretinal or intraretinal fluid, irregularity on the external photoreceptor and RPE layer, or presence of pigment epithelial detachment. No significant difference was detected between the PE group and the healthy pregnant group with respect to CMT (P=0.905), but the mean SFCT value was significantly higher in the PE group than in the healthy pregnant group (391.471.1 vs 331.553.8m, P <0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that SFCT could predict qualitative OCT findings in preeclampsia, and the optimal cut-off value was 400m with a sensitivity of 91% and a specificity of 85%. The eyes of preeclamptic women, and particularly those with positive qualitative OCT findings, showed significantly increased SFCT values. A preliminary cut-off level of 400m for SFCT is proposed for the prediction of severe preeclampsia. "
Alteration of mitochondrial membrane inner potential in three Italian patients with megaconial congenital muscular dystrophy carrying new mutations in CHKB gene.,"We investigated the predictive biomarkers for graft rejection in pig-to-non-human primate (NHP) full-thickness corneal xenotransplantation (n=34). The graft score (0-12) was calculated based on opacity, edema, and vascularization. Scores6 were defined as rejection. NHPs were divided into two groups: (a) graft rejection within 6months; and (b) graft survival until 6months. In the evaluation of 2-week biomarkers, none of the NHPs showed rejection within 2weeks and the 34 NHPs were divided into two groups: (a) entire rejection group (n=16); and (b) survival group (n=18). In the evaluation of 4-week biomarkers, four NHPs showing rejection within 4weeks were excluded and the remaining 30 NHPs were divided into two groups: (a) late rejection group (n=12); and (b) survival group (n=18). Analysis of biomarker candidates included T/B-cell subsets, levels of anti-Gal IgG/M, donor-specific IgG/M from blood, and C3a from plasma and aqueous humor (AH). CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN<sup>+</sup> cells at week 2 and AH C3a at week 4 were significantly elevated in the rejection group. Receiver operating characteristic areas under the curve was highest for AH C3a (0.847) followed by CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN<sup>+</sup> cells (both the concentration and percentage: 0.715), indicating excellent or acceptable discrimination ability, which suggests that CD8<sup>+</sup> IFN<sup>+</sup> cells at week 2 and AH C3a at week 4 are reliable biomarkers for predicting rejection in pig-to-NHP corneal xenotransplantation.

Clinical predictors at diagnosis of low risk histopathology in unilateral advanced retinoblastoma.,"Optical coherence tomography is a non-invasive ocular imaging technique that is frequently used in the diagnosis and monitoring of optic nerve or retinal disease. Advances in optical coherence tomography speed and image processing capability allow increased use of the modality in clinical practice, especially in younger children. This review outlines the challenges involved in imaging children, highlights the technological progress, the importance of acquiring normative data and, finally, focuses on the clinical applicability of optical coherence tomography in our paediatric population with various ocular conditions.

"HAWK and HARRIER: phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-masked trials of brolucizumab for neovascular age-related macular degeneration.","Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) are a unique population of multipotent cells that exhibit pluripotent properties to a certain extent and are significantly heterogeneous in terms of the cell population. We isolate a small cell subpopulation from bovine BMSCs, bovine small stem cells (bSSCs), and herein characterize their properties. The bSSCs are smaller in size and express nuclear Oct-4 and other pluripotency markers. In addition, when cultured in suspension conditions, bSSCs form three-dimensional spheres and display a strong capability for self-renewal and differentiation into cells from three germ layers. Notably, bSSCs display neural features with Sox1 and Pax6 expression. Using bSSCs as donor nuclear cells for somatic cell nuclear transfer, we further demonstrate that the developmental potential of cloned embryos in vitro is significantly increased. Our study identifies a new bovine bone marrow stromal cell-derived stem cell subtype that could have broad importance for developmental biology as well as great potential for regenerative medicine.

Lipid nanoparticles for delivery of messenger RNA to the back of the eye.,"Adiponectin, one of the adipose-derived hormone with metabolic activity, has been reported to conversely affect angiogenesis of endothelial cells in vitro. The previous study in animal models has demonstrated that adiponectin has a protective role in retinal vascular injury following pathological stimuli. However, clinical research regarding the relationship between plasma adiponectin level and diabetic retinopathy (DR) are inconclusive. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of adiponectin on high glucose-induced retinal angiogenesis and its association with autophagy by using rhesus choroid-retinal endothelial (RF-6A) cells as a model. We found that cell vitality decreased and cell migration and tube formation increased in the high-glucose group. Treatment with adiponectin or 3-methyladenine (3-MA, an autophagy inhibitor) increased cell viability and inhibited cell migration and tube formation. In the high-glucose group, the protein expression of Bax and apoptosis rate of cells increased and the expression of Bcl-2 decreased, whereas treatment with adiponectin or 3-MA reversed these results. Autophagy was activated in the high-glucose group to present as more LC3B fluorescent dots and higher expressions of LC3B, Atg5 proteins as well as lower expression of p62. Treatment with adiponectin or 3-MA inhibited autophagy by promoting the expression of p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR when compared with the high-glucose group. The results of this study suggested that adiponectin inhibits high glucose-induced angiogenesis of RF/6A cells by inhibiting autophagy, and promotion of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway might be involved in the anti-autophagy activities of adiponectin.

Early Onset Neovascular Inflammatory Vitreoretinopathy Due to a De Novo CAPN5 Mutation: Report of a Case.,"Pancreatic cancer is a heterogenous disease with a poor prognosis. This study aimed to discover and validate prognostic tissue biomarkers in pancreatic cancer using a mass spectrometry (MS) based proteomics approach. Global protein sequencing of fresh frozen pancreatic cancer and healthy pancreas tissue samples was conducted by MS to discover potential protein biomarkers. Selected candidate proteins were further verified by targeted proteomics using parallel reaction monitoring (PRM). The expression of biomarker candidates was validated by immunohistochemistry in a large tissue microarray (TMA) cohort of 141 patients with resectable pancreatic cancer. Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard modelling was used to investigate the prognostic utility of candidate protein markers. In the initial MS-discovery phase, 165 proteins were identified as potential biomarkers. In the subsequent MS-verification phase, a panel of 45 candidate proteins was verified by the development of a PRM assay. Brain acid soluble protein 1 (BASP1) was identified as a new biomarker candidate for pancreatic cancer possessing largely unknown biological and clinical functions and was selected for further analysis. Importantly, bioinformatic analysis indicated that BASP1 interacts with Wilms tumour protein (WT1) in pancreatic cancer. TMA-based immunohistochemistry analysis showed that BASP1 was an independent predictor of prolonged survival (HR 0.468, 95% CI 0.257-0.852, p=.013) and predicted favourable response to adjuvant chemotherapy, whereas WT1 indicated a worsened survival (HR 1.636, 95% CI 1.083-2.473, p=.019) and resistance to chemotherapy. Interaction analysis showed that patients with negative BASP1 and high WT1 expression had the poorest outcome (HR 3.536, 95% CI 1.336-9.362, p=.011). We here describe an MS-based proteomics platform for developing biomarkers for pancreatic cancer. Bioinformatic analysis and clinical data from our study suggest that BASP1 and its putative interaction partner WT1 can be used as biomarkers for predicting outcomes in pancreatic cancer patients. "
Bilateral Acute Depigmentation of the Iris: Findings in Anterior Segment Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography.,"ELOngation of Very Long chain fatty acids-4 (ELOVL4) is an elongase responsible for the biosynthesis of very long chain (VLC, C28) saturated (VLC-SFA) and polyunsaturated (VLC-PUFA) fatty acids in brain, retina, skin, Meibomian glands, and testes. Fascinatingly, different mutations in this gene have been reported to cause vastly different phenotypes in humans. Heterozygous inheritance of seven different mutations in the coding sequence and 5' untranslated region of ELOVL4 causes autosomal dominant Stargardt-like macular dystrophy (STGD3), while homozygous inheritance of three more mutant variants causes severe seizures with ichthyosis, hypertonia, and even death. Some recent studies have described heterozygous inheritance in yet another three mutant ELOVL4 variants, two that cause spinocerebellar ataxia-34 (SCA34) with erythrokeratodermia (EKV) and one that causes SCA34 without EKV. We identified the specific enzymatic reactions catalyzed by ELOVL4 and, using a variety of genetically engineered mouse models, have actively searched for the mechanisms by which ELOVL4 impacts neural function and health. In this review, we critically compare and contrast the various animal model and case studies involving ELOVL4 deficiency via either mutation or deletion, and the resulting consequences on neuronal health and function in both the retina and central nervous system.

Interferon Alpha for Refractory Pseudophakic Cystoid Macular Edema (Irvine-Gass Syndrome).,"Acute macular neuroretinopathy (AMN) is a rare macular disorder. The clinical diagnosis of AMN is difficult and complicated since the retinal symptoms of patients with AMN are usually unclear or untypical. Spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) is a reliable examination for imaging the retinal structure, which improved the insight of AMN in etiology and pathogenesis. This review summarizes and analyzes the recent clinical reports and research progress, in an effort to present a more accurate clinical recognition of AMN. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55:311-315)</i>.

Evaluation of the Efficacy and Safety of A Novel 0.05% Cyclosporin A Topical Nanoemulsion in Primary Sjgren's Syndrome Dry Eye.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new technology of angiography which features multiple advantages over the traditional ones. It can provide a rapid and noninvasive approach to observing the vascular morphology and blood vessel density of the optic disc, peripapillary and macular area. Nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy (NAION) is an acute optic neuropathy characterized by a sudden, painless decrease in vision and a typical visual field defect. It has been widely accepted that the circulatory insufficiency of the optic nerve head (ONH) mainly supplied by the posterior ciliary arteries (PCA) results in ischemic damage. Relevant researches are necessary for exploring the pathogenesis, diagnosis and treatment of NAION, and this review summarizes the results of recent studies on application of OCTA in analyzing the blood flow in the optic and macular area in NAION patients. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55:306-310)</i>.

Exfoliation fibrils within the basement membrane of anterior lens capsule: a transmission electron microscopy study.,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the efficacy of 20% mannitol in reducing intraocular pressure (IOP) in eyes with different intraocular tamponades after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). <b>Methods:</b> Retrospective case-control study. Sixty-eight patients were administered with 20% mannitol and IOP was noted at regular intervals after simple PPV with ocular hypertension, including 24 males (26 eyes) and 44 females (46 eyes), aged (45.619.3) years. These cases were divided into three groups according to different tamponades: silicon-oil tamponade, 23 eyes; gas tamponade, 30 eyes; balanced salt solution (BSS), 19 eyes. The data were analyzed using the <i>t</i> test, variance and <i>q</i> test. <b>Results:</b> There was a significant decrease in IOP in all patients after using 20% mannitol. The IOP in the group of silicon-oil decreased from (33.252.56) mmHg (1 mmHg=0.133 kPa) to (23.211.85) mmHg, with a maximum decrease of 30.10%; the reduction in the group of C(3)F(8) was from (33.252.84) mmHg to (12.151.12) mmHg, with a maximum decrease of 33.44%. The IOP of the two groups dropped to a minimum both at 75 minutes. In the group of BSS, the IOP decreased from (32.952.33) mmHg to (17.501.35) mmHg, and the maximum extent of the decrease was 45.82% at 45 minutes. The difference in the IOP among the three groups at 20 min, 30 min, 45 min and 60 min was statistically significant (<i>F=</i>34.02, 112.68, 122.07, 34.83, all <i>P=</i>0.00). There were significant differences between the BSS group and the silicone-oil group (<i>q=</i>6.44, 13.04, 15.00, 17.11, all <i>P=</i>0.00), and between the BSS group and the C(3)F(8) group (<i>q=</i>7.68, 12.56, 12.93, 13.61, all <i>P=</i>0.00). <b>Conclusion:</b> In eyes with different intraocular tamponades, 20% mannitol was useful for short-term IOP reduction after vitrectomy, especially in those with BSS within one hour.

Intense Pulsed Light for the Treatment of Dry Eye Owing to Meibomian Gland Dysfunction.,"<b>Objective:</b> To quantify optical coherence tomographic angiography (OCTA) images and to explore potential clinical values of each parameter in diabetic patients. <b>Methods:</b> A case-control and cross-sectional study of diabetic (129 eyes) and healthy (32 eyes) subjects was conducted. 3-mm OCTA scan, fundus photography and best corrected visual acuity measurement were performed. Image-pro plus was used to calculate microvascular and foveal avascular indices in nonsegmented and segmented OCTA images. Intraclass correlation coefficient and relative standard deviation were used to examine the reliability, reproducibility and accuracy. Correlation of each parameter was calculated, and so was the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. <b>Results:</b> Vessel density (VD) of diabetic patients measured in the nonsegmented retinal layer (RL) and superficial retinal layer (SRL) was 49.146%6.097%, 44.038%5.641%, respectively, significantly lower than healthy subjects 52.212%6.250%, 46.698%5.417% (<i>t=</i>2.534, 2.405; <i>P=</i>0.012, 0.017), and vessel length (VL) was (19.9052.285)mm, (17.5962.149)mm, (14.4792.091)mm in the three layers, which was significantly shorter than that in the healthy control group (21.0372.185)mm, (18.7391.994)mm, (15.3432.266)mm (<i>t=</i>2.529, 2.731, 2.059; <i>P=</i>0.012, 0.007, 0.041). Compared with non-diabetes, foveal avascular zone (FAZ) in diabetes was (0.4410.167)mm(2), larger compared to health eyes 0.3520.109mm(2) (<i>t=</i>-2.831, <i>P=</i>0.005). FAZ demonstrated a negative correlation with VD and VL in RL or SRL(<i>r=</i>-0.227, -0.338; <i>P<</i>0.05) (<i>r=</i>-0.241, -0.332; <i>P<</i>0.05), while best corrected visual acuity showed a negative correlation with VL in each layer (<i>r=</i>-0.225, -0.201, -0.250; <i>P=</i>0.01, 0.022, 0.004), and VD in DRL (<i>r=</i>-0.197, <i>P=</i>0.026).

The effectiveness and safety of moxibustion for dry eye: Protocol for a systematic review.,"<b>Objective:</b> To investigate the ocular manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and syphilis coinfection. <b>Methods:</b> A retrospective analysis of the ocular manifestations was carried out in 27 patients (54 eyes) diagnosed as syphilis and HIV coinfection by the Department of Infectious Medicine in Peking Union Medical College Hospital during the years of 2006-2017. The research included 26 males and 1 female, aging from 24 to 76 years old, with a mean age of 40.4012.94 years old. Ocular anterior segments were examined with slit-lamp microscope. Fundus examinations were conducted with papillary dilation, fundus photography. <b>Results:</b> At the first visit, there were 2 eyes without light perception, 4 eyes with light perception, 1 eye with hand movement, 1 eye with finger counting, 2 eyes with 0.01-0.09 eyesight, 8 eyes with 0.1-0.2 eyesight, 12 eyes with 0.25-0.4 eyesight, 15 eyes with 0.5-0.9 eyesight, 9 eyes with 1.0-1.5 eyesight. Among the 27 patients (54 eyes) coinfected with HIV and syphilis, keratic precipitates were identified in 20 eyes, aqueous flare positive in 20 eyes, float positive in 15 eyes, and iris posterior synechias in 7 eyes. Nineteen eyes were diagnosed as syphilis uveitis, including 2 eyes with syphilis anterior uveitis and 17 eyes with syphilis panuveitis, among which, vitreous inflammatory opacity was observed in all 19 eyes, disk atrophy in 2 eyes, optic edema in 1 eye, vitreous hemorrhage in 1 eye, retinal detachment in 2 eyes, retinal hemorrhage and white vein in 1 eye. In addition, 8 eyes were diagnosed as HIV retinopathy, all manifested as cotton-wool spot. Among the 8 eyes, 4 were diagnosed as cytomegalovirus retinitis, 3 showed retinal yellow-white lesions, and 1 was in late phase which showed retinal pigmentation. The incidence of both HIV and syphilis coinfection patients and male homosexuality population increased. The most common ocular manifestation of HIV and syphilis coinfection was syphilis panuveitis. Six patients first visited the Department of Ophthalmology, and were then diagnosed as HIV and syphilis coinfection. <b>Conclusions:</b> The ocular manifestations of HIV and syphilis coinfection are diversified, which can be manifested as fundus necrotic lesions as well as anterior and posterior inflammatory. For HIV positive patients, syphilis serologic test should be routinely performed. The same, syphilis positive patients should be tested for HIV serum antibodies, in order to improve the diagnosis level of HIV/syphilis coinfection and give timely etiological treatment, which is of vital importance for saving visual acuity. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55:267-272)</i>.

Reply.,"<b>Objective:</b> To determine the efficacy and safety of vitrectomy combined with implantation of a foldable capsular vitreous body in the treatment of severe retinal detachment with early ocular atrophy in human eyes. <b>Methods:</b> This study was a prospective, multicenter, and one-arm phase  clinical trial. Patients with severe retinal detachment and early eyeball atrophy attending Beijing Tongren Eye Center from April 2011 to July 2012 were included. A standard three-port pars plana vitrectomy was performed, and a foldable capsular vitreous body was folded and sent into the vitreous cavity; silicone oil was injected into the capsule. Measurement of visual acuity and intraocular pressure, corneal endothelium count, color fundus photography, optical coherence tomography, and ocular ultrasonography were performed to observe retinal reattachment and adverse reactions after surgery. Wilcoxon signed rank test was performed to compare the baseline and postoperative visual acuity, intraocular pressure and corneal endothelium count. <b>Results:</b> A total of 26 patients were enrolled, including 23 males and 3 females. The age was (37.511.5) years, with an average follow-up of 33 months. For each patient, only the left or right eye was included (13 left eyes and 13 right eyes). Retinal reattachment was found in all 24 eyes, and the eyeball atrophy was controlled in all patients. Visual acuity was improved in 4 patients (15.4%) and unchanged in 5 patients (19.2%). The mean intraocular pressure [(14.43.9) mmHg(1 mmHg=0.133 kPa)] at the last follow-up was higher than the baseline intraocular pressure [(12.06.5) mmHg], but the difference was not statistically significant (<i>Z=</i>-1.859, <i>P=</i>0.063). For the 16 patients with ocular atrophy at baseline, the last follow-up intraocular pressure [(14.63.9) mmHg] was significantly higher than the preoperative intraocular pressure [(8.52.4) mmHg] (<i>t=</i>-5.326, <i>P<</i>0.001). No obvious adverse reactions were observed. <b>Conclusions:</b> Implantation of a foldable capsular vitreous body is an effective way to treat severe retinal detachment with early eyeball atrophy. It can help to reattach the retina, control eyeball atrophy, maintain the eye shape and intraocular pressure, while visual acuity improvement is limited. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55: 259-266)</i>.

"Management of Dislocated Crystalline Lens With Vitrectomy, Perfluorocarbon Liquid, and Phacoemulsification, Combined With Modified Capsular Tension Ring and in-the-Bag Intraocular Lens Implantation.","With the rapid development of perinatology in China and the implementation of the two-child policy, the survival rate of premature and low weight infants is obviously improved, and the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in preterm infants has been increasing year by year. ROP can lead to blindness when it is serious. It is the first cause of blindness of children in our country, and it is a heavy burden on family and society. With novel insights in the pathogenesis of the disease, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy has blated its way into ophthalmological practice and significantly changed the management of ROP. However, facing such promising drugs, we still need to take caution with the safety and long-time efficacy, investigate more reasonable dosing schedules and study the follow-up time. <i>(Chin J Ophthalmol, 2019, 55: 246-249)</i>.

Implementation of a Quality Index for Improvement of Quantification of Corneal Nerves in Corneal Confocal Microcopy Images: A Multicenter Study.,"To report and characterize cases of very late onset (5years or more after surgery) flap margin corneal ulcers after laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) procedure. A retrospective case series of consecutive patients who were diagnosed with very late flap margin corneal ulcers following LASIK, between January 2014 and July 2017. All patients were treated with topical antibiotics and were followed up until complete resolution. A total of eight patients, with a mean age of 46.511years, (range 31-64years), were included in this study. All patients underwent uneventful myopic LASIK 13.33 (range 10-20) years before presentation. Patients best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at presentation was 0.200.15 logMAR compared to a final BCVA of 0.100.10 logMAR (p=0.28). The ulcer was located in the bottom two clock hours of the flap margin (5-7 o'clock) in six (75%) patients and superior (11 o'clock) in the remaining two patients (p=0.048). Seven patients (87.5%) suffered from blepharitis, and only one did not. LASIK may be associated with an increased risk of late-onset corneal ulcer occurring years after the procedure. Instability of the flap margin, blepharitis and dry eye are possible causes of epithelial disturbance and may account for this complication. "
"Outcomes of Congenital Zika Virus Infection During an Outbreak in Valle del Cauca, Colombia.","To assess the pupil light response (PLR) to chromatic stimulation in patients with different types of X-linked congenital stationary night blindness (CSNB). Eight patients with CSNB due to CACNA1F and NYX mutations were exposed to blue and red light stimuli, and PLR was evaluated using infrared video pupillography. Pupil responses were compared between CSNB patients and healthy subjects (n=34) at baseline, at maximum of constriction, for post-illumination pupil responses (PIPR) and the slope of redilation using Cohen's d. A subgroup comparison was performed descriptively between CACNA1F and NYX associated CSNB patients using the same parameters. In CSNB, smaller baseline pupil diameters compared to healthy subjects were measured both before blue and red light stimulation (d=1.44-1.625). The maximum constriction to blue light stimuli was smaller for the CSNB group compared to healthy subjects (d=1.251) but not for red light stimuli (d=0.449). Pupil response latencies were prolonged in CSNB for both light stimuli (d=-1.53 for blue and d=-1.011 for red stimulation). No relevant differences were found between the CSNB group and healthy subjects for PIPR (d=0.01), but the slope of redilation was smaller for CSNB patients (d=2.12). Paradoxical pupil constriction at light offset was not seen in our patients. A reduced redilation and smaller baseline pupil diameters for patients with CSNB indicate a disinhibition of intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells due to affected post-photoreceptor transduction via bipolar cells and can explain the pupillary behavior in our patient group.

Clinical Outcomes of Lifitegrast 5% Ophthalmic Solution in the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease.,"Pathological angiogenesis is a hallmark of various vascular diseases, including vascular eye disorders. Dysregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small regulatory RNAs, has been implicated in the regulation of ocular neovascularization. This study investigated the specific role of microRNA-145 (miR-145) in regulating vascular endothelial cell (EC) function and pathological ocular angiogenesis in a mouse model of oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR). Expression of miR-145 was significantly upregulated in OIR mouse retinas compared with room air controls. Treatment with synthetic miR-145 inhibitors drastically decreased levels of pathological neovascularization in OIR, without substantially affecting normal developmental angiogenesis. In cultured human retinal ECs, treatment with miR-145 mimics significantly increased the EC angiogenic function, including proliferation, migration, and tubular formation, whereas miR-145 inhibitors attenuated invitro angiogenesis. Tropomodulin3 (TMOD3), an actin-capping protein, is a direct miR-145 target and is downregulated in OIR retinas. Treatment with miR-145 mimic led to TMOD3 inhibition, altered actin cytoskeletal architecture, and elongation of ECs. Moreover, inhibition of TMOD3 promoted EC angiogenic function and pathological neovascularization in OIR and abolished the vascular effects of miR-145 inhibitors invitro and invivo. Overall, our findings indicate that miR-145 is a novel regulator of TMOD3-dependent cytoskeletal architecture and pathological angiogenesis and a potential target for development of treatments for neovascular eye disorders.

Long-Term Descemetocele Management With Prosthetic Replacement of the Ocular Surface Ecosystem (PROSE) Treatment.,"To evaluate geographic variation and characterize the relative contributions of patient characteristics, physician practice, and geographic region on variation in primary rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) management. Retrospective claims-based analysis PARTICIPANTS: 12,779 commercially-insured patients with incident RRD diagnosed between 2008 and 2016. We determined whether patients underwent primary RRD repair within 60 days of diagnosis, and identified type of repair performed. We identified physician ID for diagnosis and treatment, and characterized geography by Combined Statistical Areas (CSA) or Core-Based Statistical Area (CBSA). We used multilevel mixed effects logistic regression models to characterize patient-, physician-, and geographic-level variation in whether patients underwent RRD repair, and multilevel mixed effects multinomial models to characterize variation in repair type. For each model, we evaluated patient fixed effects and physician random effects nested within geographic random effects. We estimated intra-class correlation coefficients and variance partition coefficients, respectively, to compare relative contributions of patient, physician, and geography to overall variation. Odds ratios for RRD repair, variation estimates for patient, physician, and geography. The majority of incident RRD patients received treatment within 60 days of diagnosis. Pars plana vitrectomy was most common (49%), followed by laser barricade (23%), scleral buckle and pneumatic retinopexy (both 11%), and cryotherapy (5%). Physician-level variation had greater impact on receipt of any treatment than geographic-level variation (estimated variance coefficients of 1.09 and 0.32, respectively). Patient-level characteristics were estimated to represent approximately 82% of overall variation in receipt of any repair, versus 16% from physician-level and 2% from geographic-level factors. Among RRD patients who underwent repair, estimated variance coefficients were 0.07 for geography and 3.37 for physician. Physician-level factors represented approximately 50% of total variation in repair type, followed by patient-level (49%), and geographic-level factors (1%). RRD repair decisions are influenced by patient-level and physician-level factors, less so by geographic variation. Patient characteristics account for most of the variation in receipt of repair, and physician practice accounts for most of the variation in choice of procedure. These findings indicate a need for additional studies to understand drivers behind differences in care and clinical outcomes and to identify barriers in access to care. "
Repeatability and Agreement of a Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography-Based Biometer IOLMaster 700 Versus a Scheimpflug Imaging-Based Biometer AL-Scan in Cataract Patients.,"and Objective: Epidemic and seasonal infectious conjunctivitis outbreaks can adversely impact education, workforce and economy. Yet conjunctivitis is typically not a reportable disease, potentially delaying mitigating intervention. Our study objective was to determine if conjunctivitis epidemics could be identified using Google Trends search data. Search data for conjunctivitis-related and control search terms from 5 years and countries worldwide were obtained. Country and term were masked. Temporal scan statistics were applied to identify candidate epidemics. Candidates were then assessed for geotemporal concordance with an a priori defined collection of known reported conjunctivitis outbreaks, as a measure of sensitivity. Populations by country that searched Google's search engine using our study terms. Percent of known conjunctivitis outbreaks also found in the same country and time period by our candidate epidemics, identified from conjunctivitis-related searches RESULTS: We identified 135 candidate conjunctivitis epidemic periods from 77 countries. Compared to our a priori defined collection of known reported outbreaks, candidate conjunctivitis epidemics identified 18 out of 26 (69% sensitivity) of the reported country-wide and/or island nation-wide outbreaks, 9 out of 20 (45% sensitivity) of the reported region and/or district-wide outbreaks, but far fewer nosocomial and reported smaller outbreaks. Similar overall and individual sensitivity, as well as specificity, was found on a country-level basis. We also found that 83% of our candidate epidemics had start dates prior (of those, 20% were over 12 weeks prior) to their concurrent reported outbreak's report issuance date. Permutation tests provided evidence that on average conjunctivitis candidate epidemics occurred geotemporally closer to outbreak reports than chance alone would suggest (P <0.001), unlike control term candidates (P=0.40). Conjunctivitis outbreaks can be detected using temporal scan analysis of Google search data alone, with over 80% detected prior to an outbreak report's issuance date, some as early as the reported outbreak's start date. Future approaches using data from smaller regions, social media and more search terms may further improve sensitivity and cross-validate detected candidates, allowing identification of candidate conjunctivitis epidemics from Internet search data to potentially complementarily benefit traditional reporting and detection systems to improve epidemic awareness.

Orthokeratology With a New Contact Lens Design in Hyperopia: A Pilot Study.,"An increasing number of surgical strabismus patients are taking oral anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents, with more diverse mechanisms of action than those used in the past. The decision as to whether to continue these drugs throughout the perioperative period is difficult and must be based on the balance between hemorrhagic and thrombotic risk. To help guide strabismus surgeons with clinical management in these cases, we review potential hemorrhagic complications of strabismus surgery and examine the use of anticoagulant and antiplatelet drugs during the perioperative period. Surgical strategies that might help minimize intraoperative hemorrhage in patients on anticoagulant therapy are also discussed. "
CANOMAD Presenting as Bilateral Sixth Nerve Palsies.,"To assess the relationship between the meibomian gland loss (MGL) and relevant ocular surface clinical parameters as well as the influence of age in this relationship. A total of 161 participants (mean age; 4217 years) were enrolled in this study. Infrared meibography was performed using Keratograph 5M (K5M; Oculus GmbH, Wetzlar). Participants were divided into five groups according to total meiboscore and the ocular surface parameters of each MGL group were studied. In addition, the relationship between MGL and the ocular surface parameters was established including age as covariant. Both eyelids were taken into account since no association between the MGL from upper and lower eyelid was found (k value=0.2; p=0.3) despite they were significantly correlated (r= 0.3; p<0.001). No statistically significant differences were found in symptomatology among different MGL groups. Statistically significant differences were found among MGL groups in tear osmolarity (p=0.02), bulbar redness (p=0.04), corneal and conjunctival staining (p=0.01 and p=0.004, respectively). Despite this, only corneal staining showed a significant correlation with MGL when age was covariant (r=0.2; p=0.04). MGL higher than 50% seems to be accompanied by signs on the ocular surface. Furthermore, age demonstrated to be a relevant factor when assessing MGL. For this reason, future studies should compare age-matched groups in order to know the contribution of the MGL on the ocular surface and establish valid cut-off values for dry eye diagnosis. "
Increased microvascular disease in X-linked and autosomal recessive Alport syndrome: a case control cross sectional observational study.,"To provide a systematic review on ophthalmologic presentations of dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) in conjunction with a case report of primary orbital involvement by this tumor. A thorough electronic search on PubMed, Medline, Scopus, EMBASE and web of science databases was performed. All available data from reported cases along with our described case were extracted and analyzed. We describe a 66-year-old male with primary orbital DFSP who was managed by total excision of the tumor without recurrence after 18 months of follow-up. In the literature, 14 studies reporting 15 cases were identified and reviewed. Our review topics included epidemiology, clinical presentations, pathologic features, differential diagnosis, imaging, treatment and prognosis. Rarely, but crucially, ophthalmologists may encounter DFSP in the orbital or periorbital area. They should be familiar with the pathologic nature and treatment options for this tumor. This diagnosis should be kept in mind when approaching a case with a non-tender, nodular, firm, mass or more rarely an indenting orbital mass. "
Horizontal gaze palsy and progressive scoliosis with two novel ROBO3 gene mutations in two Jordanian families.,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is a rare disease that commonly presents with optic nerve and spinal cord inflammation, and it is associated with the presence of aquaporin-4 immunoglobulin G antibody (AQP4-IgG). Information on the clinical profile and occurrence of NMOSD among Filipino patients, however, is not sufficiently documented. In this series, we presented eighteen (18) patients with NMOSD consecutively seen in the Philippine General Hospital, a major tertiary referral center. Demographic data showed a female-to-male ratio of 2.6:1. Median age of onset of symptoms was 26 years. Eight patients (53.3%) were positive for AQP4-IgG. Most patients initially presented with myelitis (56.6%) and followed by optic neuritis (16.7%) and area postrema syndrome (16.7%). All patients had longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Cranial MRI rarely demonstrated lesions in the optic nerves (18.2%). CSF pleocytosis (33%) and increased protein (8.3%) were infrequent. These results demonstrated that the profile of Filipino patients with NMOSD seen in our institution strengthens those described in other populations with this disorder. Large scale cross-sectional studies are necessary to fully define the profile of these patients and to determine with accuracy the prevalence and incidence of this disorder in the Philippines. Further investigation regarding the utility of ancillary tests as diagnostic and prognostic indicators in patients with NMOSD are also suggested by the authors. "
An overview of optical coherence tomography angiography and the posterior pole.,"In a study published last year we showed the Barrett was the single most accurate IOL formula overall. Herein we report on the outcomes of new or updated formulas when run against the same datasets. Achievement of a target refractive outcome has become an integral part of cataract surgery. Fortunately, the advent of optical biometry and introduction of newer generation intraocular lens (IOL) calculation formulas has improved our ability to accurately predict cataract surgery refractive outcomes, as we showed in a study published in Ophthalmology last year.<sup>1</sup> Since that report, several new or updated formulas have become available. We evaluated the latest formulas using the same dataset to determine whether they offer the potential for even more accurate prediction of refractive outcomes. The study was performed under a Kaiser Permanente IRB approval which did not require individual informed consent. "
Cyclosporine and prednisolone combination therapy as a potential therapeutic strategy for relentless placoid chorioretinitis.,"Corneal endothelium is a cellular monolayer positioned on the Descemet's membrane at the anterior cornea, and it plays a critical role in maintaining corneal clarity. Our present study examines the feasibility of utilizing our 3-dimensional (3D) corneal stromal construct, which consists of human corneal fibroblasts (HCF) and their self-assembled matrix, to observe the development and maturation of human corneal endothelial cells (HCEndoCs) in a co-culture model. Three-dimensional HCF constructs were created by growing the HCFs on Transwell membranes in Eagles' minimum essential medium (EMEM)+10% FBS+0.5mM Vitamin C (VitC) for about 4 weeks. HCEndoCs, either primary (pHCEndoC) or cell line (HCEndoCL), were either seeded in chamber slides, directly on the Transwell membranes, or on the 3D HCF constructs and cultivated for 5 days or 2 weeks. The HCEndoCs that were seeded directly on the Transwell membranes were exposed indirectly to HCF by culturing the HCF on the plate beneath the membrane. Cultures were examined for morphology and ultrastructure using light and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). In addition, indirect-immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) was used to examine tight junction formation (ZO-1), maturation (ALDH1A1), basement membrane formation (Laminin), cell proliferation (Ki67), cell death (caspase-3), and fibrotic response (CTGF). As expected, both pHCEndoCs and HCEndoCLs formed monolayers on the constructs; however, the morphology of the HCEndoCLs appeared to be similar to that seen in vivo, uniform and closely packed, whereas the pHCEndoCs remained elongated. The IF data showed that laminin localization was present in the HCEndoCs' cytoplasm as cell-cell contact increased, and when they were grown in the 3D co-culture, the beginnings of what appears to be a continuous DM-like structure was observed. In addition, in co-cultures, ALDH1A1-positive HCEndoCs were present, ZO-1 expression localized within the tight junctions, minimal numbers of HCEndoCs were Ki67-or Caspase-3-positive, and CTGF was positive in both the HCEndoCs cytoplasm and the matrix of the co-culture. Also, laminin localization was stimulated in HCEndoCs upon indirect stimuli secreted by HCF. The present data suggests our 3D co-culture model is useful for studying corneal endothelium maturation in vitro since the co-culture promotes new DM-like formation, HCEndoCs develop in vivo-like characteristics, and the fibrotic response is activated. Our current findings are applicable to understanding the implications of corneal endothelial injection therapy, such as if the abnormal DM has to be removed from the patient, the newly injected endothelial cells will seed onto the wound area and deposit a new DM-like membrane. However, caution should be observed and as much of the normal DM should be left intact since removal of the DM can cause a posterior stromal fibrotic response. "
Inter-visit measurement variability of conjunctival vasculature and circulation in habitual contact lens wearers and non-lens wearers.,"Dysfunction and eventual loss of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells is a hallmark of atrophic age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and linked to oxidative and nitrosative damage. Herein, we use high-throughput screening (HTS) to identify compounds that protect human RPE cells from oxidative stress-induced cell death and elucidate the possible mechanism of action. HTS was used to identify compounds that protect RPE cells from oxidative damage. We then tested the identified compound(s) in models of RPE stress, including tert-butyl hydroperoxide (TBHP) exposure, UV-B-mediated light damage and nitrosative stress to the basement membrane using ARPE-19cells, primary human RPE and induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived RPE cells from patients with AMD. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) was used to detect gene expression of oxidative stress- and apoptosis-related genes and mitochondrial function was measured by the Seahorse XF96 analyzer to elucidate possible mechanisms of action. Five thousand and sixty-five compounds were screened, and of these, 12 compounds were active based on their ability to improve cell viability after exposure to TBHP. After chemical structure review, we identified ciclopirox olamine as a potent inhibitor of oxidative damage to RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine increased cell viability in ARPE-19cells treated with TBHP, UV-B light or on nitrite-treated ECM by 1.68-fold, 1.54-fold and 4.3-fold, respectively (p<0.01). Treatment with TBHP altered expression of genes related to oxidative stress and apoptosis, which was reversed by pretreatment with ciclopirox olamine. Ciclopirox olamine improved mitochondrial function in TBHP-exposed ARPE-19cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells. Ciclopirox olamine protected primary human RPE cells and iPSC-derived RPE cells from the oxidative stress or damaged basement membrane. HTS of bioactive FDA-approved libraries and follow-up studies can be used to identify small molecules (including ciclopirox olamine) that protect RPE cells exposed to various stressors associated with disease progression of AMD. This strategy can be used to identify potential compounds for treatment and prevention of AMD. "
Characteristic Diagnostic Clues of Metatropic Dysplasia: The Lumbothoracic Humpback with Dumbbell Appearance of the Long Bones.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) plays implicated roles in diabetic retinopathy (DR). The role of roundabout 4 (Robo 4) in angiogenesis and vasculogenesis is controversial; however, the interdependent relationship between these two factors has not been studied in DR. This study determined the colocalization of VEGF and Robo4 in fibrovascular membranes (FVM) from patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). MicroRNA (miRNA)-mediated modulation of VEGF and Robo4 was explored in diabetic rats and ARPE-19 tissue culture cells under hyperglycemia. VEGF and Robo4 co-expression in the FVM was analyzed using immunofluorescence. VEGF and Robo4 levels were determined in diabetic retinas and ARPE-19 tissue culture cells under high glucose using western blotting and RT-qPCR. MicroRNA agomir was intraocularly injected to increase miR-15a expression and downregulate VEGF and Robo4 levels in diabetic retinas. VEGF and Robo4 colocalization in FVM vessels was observed. Increased VEGF levels were consistent in diabetic retinas and ARPE-19 tissue culture cells cultured under hyperglycemia. Robo4 decreased in ARPE-19 tissue culture cells exposed to hyperglycemia for 72h, whereas it increased in diabetic rat retinas. Several miRNAs were differentially expressed during DR progression. Furthermore, miR-15a agomir injection inhibited high levels of VEGF and Robo4 in diabetic retinas. VEGF and Robo4 were co-expressed in FVMs from PDR patients. In the early stages of DR, VEGF was upregulated and contributed to DR development, whereas, in the late stage of DR, VEGF and Robo4 worked together to aggravate DR progression. However, miR-15a could downregulate VEGF and Robo4 to ameliorate DR development. "
Traumatic superior orbital fissure syndrome.,"To determine the physiology of the macula by the focal macular electroretinograms (fmERGs) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion with macular edema (BRVOME) treated by intravitreal injections of ranibizumab (IVR). We studied 17 eyes of 17 patients with BRVOME. The contralateral unaffected eyes served as controls. All patients were treated with an IVR at monthly intervals for 3 consecutive months. The baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), optical coherence tomographic (OCT) findings, and fmERGs were compared to the post-treatment values. The fmERGs were elicited by a 15 circular spot or a superior or inferior semicircular spot. The center of the spot was placed on the fovea. The amplitudes of the a- and b-waves, photopic negative response (PhNR), and sum of the oscillatory potentials (OPs: sum of OP1, OP2, and OP3 amplitudes) were measured. In addition, the implicit times of the a- and b-waves were also measured. The BCVA improved significantly from 0.390.28 logMAR units to 0.170.18 logMAR units after the resolution of the central macular edema (P<0.01). All components of the fmERGs elicited by the semicircular stimulus spot placed on the occluded side were smaller than that elicited from the corresponding area of the control eyes. The b-wave amplitudes increased significantly from 0.490.25 to 0.750.36V following the IVR injections, but the amplitudes of the a-wave and PhNR remained reduced (P<0.05). The amplitudes of the PhNR and OPs elicited by stimulating the non-occluded side were reduced with relative preservation of the a- and b-waves (P<0.05). They recovered after the treatment from 0.270.15 to 0.500.30 and 0.330.15 to 0.530.19V, respectively. IVRs improved the macular function not only on the occluded side but also on the non-occluded side. On the occluded side, the BRVOME affects the function of all retinal layers of the macula. Even after the IVR, the function of the photoreceptors and retinal ganglion cells remained abnormal. On the non-occluded side, the inner retinal function improved after the IVR. "
Purtscher's retinopathy in one and sixth nerve palsy in the other eye following head trauma.,"Strabismus is acommon cause for amblyopia and affected children need regular ophthalmic care. This study evaluated the frequency of ophthalmic care in children suffering from strabismus and analyzed associated factors. The data of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents from the Robert Koch Institute (KiGGS, baseline survey 2003-2006, N=17,640) were analyzed. Details on the presence of strabismus and the frequency of ophthalmic care were documented from information provided by the parents. Children aged 1-6years were included. The relationship between strabismus and ophthalmic care in the previous 12months was analyzed using multivariable logistic regression analysis and adjusted for age, sex, socioeconomic status, migration background, region and participation in regular pediatric check-ups. A total of 5247 children were included in this study of which 3.0% (N=175) were reported by the parents as suffering from strabismus. Ophthalmic care within the last 12months was reported by 66.9% of the parents (95% confidence interval [CI] 54.7-77.2%) of children with strabismus and was more frequent compared to those without strabismus (19.7%, 95% CI 18.2-21.3%). Of the children with strabismus 33.8% had visited an ophthalmologist in the last 12months once, 33.1% twice, 12.6% three times, 13.3% four times and 7.2% more than four times. There was arelationship between strabismus (odds ratio [OR]=9.21, 95% CI 5.44-15.6) and ophthalmic care during the preceding year. In Germany approximately one third of children with strabismus did not receive ophthalmic care within the previous year. This underlines the need for improvements in ophthalmic care in children with strabismus. "
Advancement flap for anterior lamellar reconstruction of the upper eyelid.,"Elevated cortisol level is an component of the stress response. However, some patients have low cortisol levels; a condition termed: critical illness-related corticosteroid insufficiency (CIRCI). Basal cortisol levels during PICU admission may be related to outcome. This prospective cohort study aimed to assess basal total serum cortisol levels and their relation to outcome in PICU. The study included 81 children over 6 months.Total serum cortisol was assessed using an early morning sample. The severity of illness was assessed using the PRISM-IIIscore. Outcome measures included mechanical ventilation duration, use of inotropic support, length of stay, mortality. Comparison between patients' subgroups according to total serum cortisol levels revealed significantly higher PRISM-III score in patients with total serum cortisol levels. In addition, those patients had a significantly higher mortality rate when compared with patients with low and normal total serum cortisol levels. Multivariate logistic regression analysis recognized high total serum cortisol level and PRISM-III score as significant predictors of mortality. We concluded that PRISM-III score and elevated total serum cortisol levels are significant predictors of mortality in the PICU. Although CIRCI is prevalent in this population, it wasn't associated with an increased mortality rate. "
Purtscher's retinopathy in scleroderma.,"To investigate changes in ocular perfusion following three consecutive intravitreal injections with aflibercept for treatment of neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). The study included 20 eyes from 20 Caucasian patients with unilateral nAMD and 20 fellow eyes. All nAMD eyes were treated with standard intravitreal injection of aflibercept (IVA; 2 mg). Measurements of ocular perfusion at the optic nerve head (ONH) and the choroid were performed with laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). Measurements were conducted at baseline, 1week after the first injection, at the time point of the second and third injection as well as 1 month after the third injection. In treated eyes, mean blur rate (the main output parameter of LSFG) in the ONH microvasculature and in the choroid was significantly reduced 1 week after the first IVA treatment. The effect persisted throughout the entire follow-up period (p<0.001). No change in ocular perfusion was observed in fellow eyes. IVA for treatment of nAMD leads to a reduction in perfusion of the ONH and the choroid in the treated eye with no apparent effect on the fellow eye. "
Optic neuritis in an immunocompetent 40-year-old female due to fungal sphenoidal sinusitis.,"Defects in retinol dehydrogenase 12 (<i>RDH12</i>) account for 3.4%-10.5 % of Leber congenital amaurosis and early-onset severe retinal dystrophy (EOSRD) and are a potential target for gene therapy. Clinical trials in inherited retinal diseases have unique challenges, and natural history studies are critical to successful trial design. The purpose of this study was to characterise the natural history of <i>RDH12</i>-associated retinal degeneration. A retrospective chart review was performed in individuals with retinal degeneration and two likely disease-causing variants in <i>RDH12</i>. 57 subjects were enrolled from nine countries. 33 subjects had clinical records available from childhood. The data revealed an EOSRD, with average age of onset of 4.1 years. Macular atrophy was a universal clinical finding in all subjects, as young as 2 years of age. Scotopic and photopic electroretinography (ERG) responses were markedly reduced in all subjects, and a non-recordable ERG was documented as young as 1year of age. Assessment of visual acuity, visual field and optical coherence tomography revealed severe loss of function and structure in the majority of subjects after the age of 10 years. Widefield imaging in 23 subjects revealed a unique, variegated watercolour-like pattern of atrophy in 13 subjects and sparing of the peripapillary area in 18 subjects. This study includes the largest collection of phenotypic data from children with <i>RDH12</i>-associated EOSRD and provides a comprehensive description of the timeline of vision loss in this severe, early-onset condition. These findings will help identify patients with <i>RDH12</i>-associated retinal degeneration and will inform future design of therapeutic trials. "
Macular hyperpigmentary changes in <i>ABCA4</i>-Stargardt disease.,"The goal of this study was to assess changes in OCT parameters occurring in high myopic glaucoma patients, so as to enable early diagnosis and prevention of progressive glaucomatous damage. It was performed at the department of ophthalmology, Kasr Alainy Hospital, Cairo University, over a twenty-month period. This study was a cross-sectional randomized single blinded study. It included 62 eyes of highly myopic individuals. Patients were divided into 2 groups: Group A included myopic non-glaucomatous individuals, and Group B included the myopic glaucoma patients. All patients had a full ophthalmological examination, as well as OCT assessment of the RNFL, GCC and ONH parameters. The VF was tested as well as AXL and CCT. Correlation of the data was performed. Regarding the GLV, its mean in group A was 11.886.71% versus 19.699.69% in group B; the difference between both groups was statistically significant (P=0.001). Regarding the cup area, the mean in group A was 0.510.41mm<sup>2</sup>, while that in group B was 1.250.72mm<sup>2</sup>; the difference between both groups was statistically significant (P<0.001). The ONH parameter, cup area, and the GCC parameter, GLV, are key parameters in supporting the diagnosis of glaucoma in myopic patients. Other parameters measured by OCT, such as inferior RNFL thickness, FLV, and C/D ratio, could aid in diagnosis as well. "
Intramuscular Injection of Adenoassociated Virus Encoding Human Neurotrophic Factor 3 and Exercise Intervention Contribute to Reduce Spasms after Spinal Cord Injury.,"The European Medicines Agency has defined Big Data by the ""3 V\'s"": Volume, Velocity and Variety. These large databases allow access to real life data on patient care. They are particularly suited for studies of adverse events and pharmacoepidemiology. Deep learning is a collection of algorithms used in machine learning, used to model high-level abstractions in data using model architectures, which are composed of multiple nonlinear transformations. This article shows how Big Data and Deep Learning can help in ophthalmology, pointing out their advantages and disadvantages. A literature review is presented in this article illustrating the uses of Deep Learning in ophthalmology. "
Immunopathogenesis of Behcet's Disease.,"To evaluate overall upper eyelid laxity according to age and sleep position. This single-center prospective study was conducted on healthy subjects between 20 and 89 years of age and was approved by the institutional review board and the ethics committee. Data collected were age, sex, weight and height, ophthalmological history, general history (diabetes, hypertension, smoking) and preferred sleep position (lateral, ventral, dorsal decubitus or no preference). Overall upper eyelid laxity was measured using the McNab technique. In total, 280 patients were included in the study - 40 per 10-year age bracket. Mean overall right eyelid laxity was measured at 5.35mm (5.38mm on the left) between 20 and 29 years old and 8.28mm (8.43mm on the left) between 80 and 89 years old. 161 patients slept in a lateral decubitus position. Median overall upper eyelid laxity for the sleep side was 8mm vs. 7mm for the non-sleep side. Overall upper eyelid laxity increased significantly with age (P<0.001) and compared to the contralateral side (P<0.001). Overall upper eyelid hyperlaxity can be defined as a measurement (by the McNab technique) greater than: 7mm between 20 and 29 years, 8mm between 30 and 39 years, 9mm between 40 and 69 years and 10mm between 70 and 89 years. This study provides new data on normal eyelid laxity in the general population according to age and sleep position. "
Bilateral angle closure glaucoma in a teenage girl - A rare presentation in Arab population - A case report.,"This is an overview of the sensorimotor impairments in dystonia, a syndrome characterized by sustained or intermittent aberrant movement patterns leading to abnormal movements and/or postures with or without a tremulous component. Dystonia can affect the entire body or specific body regions and results from a plethora of etiologies, including subtle changes in gray and white matter in several brain regions. Research over the last 25 years addressing topics of sensorimotor control has shown functional sensorimotor impairments related to sensorimotor integration, timing, oculomotor and head control, as well as upper and lower limb control. In the context of efforts to update the classification of dystonia, sensorimotor research is highly relevant for a better understanding of the underlying pathology, and potential mechanisms contributing to global and regional dysfunction within the central nervous system. This overview of relevant research regarding sensorimotor control in humans with idiopathic dystonia attempts to frame the dysfunction with respect to what is known regarding motor control in patients and healthy individuals. We also highlight promising avenues for the future study of neuromotor control that may help to further elucidate dystonia etiology, pathology, and functional characteristics. "
Outcomes of pediatric retinoblastoma treated with ICEV regimen: A single-center study.,"Vision loss caused by leukemic infiltration of the optic nerve is an oncologic emergency. To maintain vision, radiotherapy must be initiated quickly. However, many pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients with ophthalmic and central nervous system (CNS) relapse receive intrathecal methotrexate and/or cytarabine. Conflicting reports about intrathecal therapy potentiating radiation toxicity complicate decision-making. Here we present a teaching case to illustrate the safety and effectiveness of radiotherapy, even in the setting of concurrent intrathecal treatment. The patient was a 22-month-old female with CNS relapse of ALL, presenting with new funduscopic evidence of left optic nerve infiltration, and MRI evidence of bilateral involvement. Her optic nerve disease was progressing through systemic induction chemotherapy and intrathecal cytarabine, hydrocortisone, and methotrexate. We proceeded with emergent simulation and treatment under general anesthesia, targeting the bilateral posterior orbits (retinae), optic nerves, optic chiasm, and given clinical concern for possible partial third nerve palsy, the cavernous sinus. Treatment with 12 Gy in 6 daily fractions was administered. Neuro-ophthalmology evaluation 1.5 months later found worsening left vision, but her right vision and funduscopic exam remained normal along with normal MRI findings on the right. Six months after undergoing treatment, she was doing well after undergoing allogeneic bone marrow transplant. This case illustrates important teaching points for leukemic optic nerve infiltration: radiotherapy should be initiated immediately to restore/maintain vision, and the literature suggests that, even in the setting of intrathecal chemotherapy, ophthalmic radiation may be safe and effective. "
A New Rabbit Model of Chronic Dry Eye Disease Induced by Complete Surgical Dacryoadenectomy.,"Gene therapy of malignant gliomas has shown a lack of clinical success to date due in part to inability of conventional gene vectors to achieve widespread gene transfer throughout highly disseminated tumor areas within the brain. Here, we demonstrate that newly engineered polymer-based DNA-loaded nanoparticles (DNA-NP) possessing small particle diameters (~50nm) and non-adhesive surface polyethylene glycol (PEG) coatings efficiently penetrate brain tumor tissue as well as healthy brain parenchyma. Specifically, this brain-penetrating nanoparticle (BPN), following intracranial administration via convection enhanced delivery (CED), provides widespread transgene expression in heathy rodent striatum and an aggressive brain tumor tissue established orthotopically in rats. The ability of BPN to efficiently traverse both tissues is of great importance as the highly invasive glioma cells infiltrated into normal brain tissue are responsible for tumor recurrence. Of note, the transgene expression within the orthotopic tumor tissue occurred preferentially in glioma cells over microglial cells. We also show that three-dimensional (3D) multicellular spheroids established with malignant glioma cells, unlike conventional two-dimensional (2D) cell cultures, serve as an excellent in vitro model reliably predicting gene vector behaviors in vivo. Briefly, DNA-NP possessing greater surface PEG coverage exhibited more uniform and higher-level transgene expression both in the 3D model and in vivo, whereas the trend was opposite in 2D culture. The finding here alerts that gene transfer studies based primarily on 2D cultures should be interpreted with caution and underscores the relevance of 3D models for screening newly engineered gene vectors prior to their in vivo evaluation. "
A Comparison study of Ranibizumab and Aflibercept in patients with naive diabetic macular edema in presence of serous retinal detachment.,"To assess the effect of somatostatin (SST) on the permeability of human retinal pigment epithelial cells. We conducted two experiments, exposing cells from human-fetal retinal pigment epithelium (hfRPE) cultures to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), with or without SST pretreatment, in one, and to hypoxic conditions, again with or without SST pretreatment, in the other. The paracellular permeability of hfRPE was assessed by measuring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and fluorescein isothiocyanate-sodium (FITC-sodium) flux. Immunochemistry analysis was used to assess the expression of occludin and Zonula occludens-1(ZO-1). Both VEGF and hypoxia increased permeability of the hfRPE, as measured by TER and tracer flux, and decreased occludin and ZO-1staining, as measured by immunochemistry. Pretreatment of cultures with SST partially counteracted these effects. Somatostatin may play a role in the regulation of permeability across retinal pigment epithelium. It may act as an anti-permeability factor in the retina through the enhancement of tight junction function. "
Optical Coherence Tomography Findings in Pre-Eclampsia: A Preliminary Receiver Operating Characteristic Analysis on Choroidal Thickness for Disease Severity.,"A patient with bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation (BDUMP) associated with endometrial cancer was treated with plasmapheresis, but failed therapy with progressive serous retinal detachment. We collected plasma before and after plasmapheresis therapy. Our goal was to determine if the cultured melanocyte elongation and proliferation (CMEP) factor and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was present in the IgG enriched fraction and understand why our patient failed plasmapheresis therapy. Melanocytes were cultured for 3-5 days in the presence of control medium, unfractionated pre-plasmapheresis BDUMP medium, IgG enriched or IgG depleted BDUMP medium, or unfractionated post-plasmapheresis BDUMP medium. Subretinal fluid was collected from patients with BDUMP and control retinal detachments and analyzed by electropheresis with immunoblotting. Medium with unfractionated BDUMP plasma stimulated melanocyte growth 1.4-1.5 fold compared to control medium on days 3-5 (p<0.001 for all). Both IgG enriched and IgG depleted BDUMP medium mildly increased melanocyte growth 1.3 fold (p<0.05 for enriched, p<0.01 for depleted) compared to control. In comparison, unfractionated BDUMP medium caused a 1.7-fold increase in melanocyte growth, which was significantly more than the enriched (p<0.01) and depleted (p<0.05) fractions. Pre-plasmapheresis and post-plasmapheresis unfractionated BDUMP medium equally stimulated melanocyte growth 1.7-fold (p<0.05) compared to control. HGF was present in IgG depleted, pre-plasmapheresis, and post-plasmapheresis samples, but absent in the IgG enriched fraction. There was no enrichment of IgG in the subretinal fluid from eyes with BDUMP. In conclusion, CMEP factor is not concentrated in the IgG enriched plasma fraction in our patient who failed plasmapheresis therapy. HGF levels have no correlation with melanocyte growth. Because plasmapheresis preferentially removes immunoglobulins from the plasma, our patient responded poorly to plasmapheresis treatment with worsening retinal detachment. "
Predictive biomarkers for graft rejection in pig-to-non-human primate corneal xenotransplantation.,"Neurothekeomas (NTK) are benign soft tissue tumors most commonly occurring in the head, neck and upper extremities of young adults, with a female preponderance. Herein we report 2 cases of ocular NTK presenting as an orbital mass or chalazion. Both cases underwent excision of the mass with histopathologic diagnosis of cellular NTK. Tumor cells for both cases were immunopositive for smooth muscle actin (SMA), microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) and cluster of differentiation 10 (CD10). S100, human melanoma black 45 (HMB45) and melanoma antigen recognized by t-cell (Melan A) were negative. Both were associated with scattered histiocytes which were positive for cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68). To date, including our 2 cases, there have been 22 cases of ocular and periorbital adnexal NTK reported in the English literature. Although rare, clinicians should include neurothekeoma in their differential diagnosis in patients presenting with a periocular soft tissue tumor. "
Optical coherence tomography in paediatric clinical practice.,"Approximately 25% of school-aged children in the United States have vision abnormalities, most commonly refractive error that can be corrected with spectacles. Limited follow-up adherence after failed school-based vision screening led to an increase in school-based eye care programs that provide screening, eye examinations, and spectacle prescription at the school. These programs address the access barrier and often provide the first point of contact between children and eye care. Nevertheless, several lower prevalence conditions, such as amblyopia, strabismus, and glaucoma, cannot be adequately treated in the school setting, and some require frequent and long-term follow-up, necessitating referral to eye care providers in the community. We conducted a literature review and identified 10 programs that provided school-based screening, examinations, and spectacle prescription and reviewed their referral rates, criteria, mechanisms, adherence, ocular findings at referral, and long-term care plans. Most programs referred 1% to 5% of screened children. Most programs communicated with parents or guardians through referral letters and utilized various strategies to incentivize adherence. Referral adherence was 20-50% in the four programs that reported this data. School-based eye care programs rarely referred children for long-term follow-up care needs, such as updating spectacle prescriptions annually. "
A new subset of small stem cells in bovine bone marrow stromal cell populations.,"SMARCB1 (SWI/SNF Related Matrix Associated Actin Dependent Regulator Of Chromatin Subfamily B Member 1), also known as integrase interactor 1 (INI1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma, is a rare entity that was first described in 2014 (1). Since then, there have been 39 cases published in the literature, with basaloid or plasmacytoid/rhabdoid morphology being the most common pathological subtype (2). We report a patient with SMARCB1 (INI-1)-deficient sinonasal carcinoma who had permanent vision loss after valsalva-induced acute hemorrhage and resultant orbital compartment syndrome. "
Adiponectin inhibits high glucose-induced angiogenesis via inhibiting autophagy in RF/6A cells.,"Purpose/Aim: Many genes have been associated with primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). Knowing exactly where they are expressed in the eye helps to unravel POAG pathology and to select optimal targets for intervention. We investigated whether RNA in-situ hybridization (RNA-ISH) is a convenient technique to obtain detailed pan-ocular expression data of these genes. We tested this for four diverse candidate POAG genes, selected because of unclear ocular distribution (F5 and Dusp1) and relevance for potential new therapies (Tnf, Tgfr3). Optn, a POAG gene with well-known ocular expression pattern served as control. We made a list of candidate glaucoma genes reported in genetic studies. A table of their ocular expression at the tissue level was compiled using publicly available microarray data (the ocular tissue database). To add cellular detail we performed RNA-ISH for Optn, Tnf, Tgfr3, F5, and Dusp1 on eyes of healthy, 2-month-old, pigmented and albino mice. Expression of the Optn control matched with published immunohistochemistry data. Ocular expression of Tnf was generally low, with patches of higher Tnf expression, superficially in the corneal epithelium. F5 had a restricted expression pattern with high expression in the non-pigmented ciliary body epithelium and moderate expression in the peripapillary region. Tgfr3 and Dusp1 showed ubiquitous expression. RNA-ISH is a suitable technique to determine the ocular expression pattern of POAG genes, adding meaningful cellular detail to existing microarray expression data. For instance, the high expression of F5 in the non-pigmented ciliary body epithelium suggests a role of this gene in aqueous humor dynamics and intraocular pressure. In addition, the ubiquitous expression of Tgfr3 has implications for designing TGF- related glaucoma therapies, with respect to side effects. Creating pan-ocular expression maps of POAG genes with RNA-ISH will help to identify POAG pathways in specific cell types and to select targets for drug development. "
Quantitative proteomics identifies brain acid soluble protein 1 (BASP1) as a prognostic biomarker candidate in pancreatic cancer tissue.,"Endothelial cells exposed to the Random Positioning Machine (RPM) reveal three different phenotypes. They grow as a two-dimensional monolayer and form three-dimensional (3D) structures such as spheroids and tubular constructs. As part of the ESA-SPHEROIDS project we want to understand how endothelial cells (ECs) react and adapt to long-term microgravity. During a spaceflight to the International Space Station (ISS) and a subsequent stay onboard, human ECs (EA.hy926 cell line) were cultured for 12 days in real microgravity inside an automatic flight hardware, specially designed for use in space. ECs were cultivated in the absence or presence of vascular endothelial growth factor, which had demonstrated a cell-protective effect on ECs exposed to an RPM simulating microgravity. After cell fixation in space and return of the samples, we examined cell morphology and analyzed supernatants by Multianalyte Profiling technology. The fixed samples comprised 3D multicellular spheroids and tube-like structures in addition to monolayer cells, which are exclusively observed during growth under Earth gravity (1g). Within the 3D aggregates we detected enhanced collagen and laminin. The supernatant analysis unveiled alterations in secretion of several growth factors, cytokines, and extracellular matrix components as compared to cells cultivated at 1g or on the RPM. This confirmed an influence of gravity on interacting key proteins and genes and demonstrated a flight hardware impact on the endothelial secretome. Since formation of tube-like aggregates was observed only on the RPM and during spaceflight, we conclude that microgravity may be the major cause for ECs' 3D aggregation. "
Methodological concerns on retinal and choroidal thickness variations measured by optical coherence tomography in patients with epilepsy.,"Eye rheum is a physiological discharge, which accumulates at the medial angle of the healthy eye soon after opening in the morning. Microscopic evaluation of eye rheum revealed the presence of viable neutrophils, bacteria, epithelial cells, and particles, aggregated by neutrophil extracellular traps. We observed that in the evening, during eye closure, high C5a recruited neutrophils to the tear film and activated them. In this hypoxic area rich in CO<sub>2</sub> , neutrophils fight microbial aggressors by degranulation. Immediately after eye opening, the microenvironment of the ocular surface changes, the milieu gets normoxic, and loss of CO<sub>2</sub> induces subtle alkalinization of tear film. These conditions favored the formation of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that initially covers the ocular surface and tend to aggregate by eyelid blinking. These aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps (aggNETs) are known as eye rheum and contain several viable neutrophils, epithelial cells, dust particles, and crystals packed together by NETs. Similar to aggNETs induced by monosodium urate crystals, the eye rheum shows a robust proteolytic activity that degraded inflammatory mediators before clinically overt inflammation occur. Finally, the eye rheum passively floats with the tear flow to the medial angle of the eye for disposal. We conclude that the aggNETs-based eye rheum promotes cleaning of the ocular surface and ameliorates the inflammation on the neutrophil-rich ocular surfaces. "
ELOVL4: Very long-chain fatty acids serve an eclectic role in mammalian health and function.,"Combining mobile telephone use with driving is not unusual. However, distracted driving limits driving performance because of limited capacity for persons to divide attention. To investigate the frequency of mobile telephone use while driving and to assess whether patients with glaucoma had a disproportionate decrease in driving performance while conversing on a mobile telephone compared with healthy participants. Cross-sectional study of surveys collected from 112 patients with glaucoma and 70 control participants investigating mobile telephone use while driving. A randomly selected subgroup of 37 patients with glaucoma and 28 controls drove in a driving simulator to investigate peripheral event detection performance during distracted driving at the Visual Performance Laboratory, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina. Data collection was performed from December 1, 2016, through April 30, 2017. Participants answered a survey and submitted to a driving simulation test with and without mobile telephone use. Survey answers were collected, and distracted driving performance, assessed by reaction time to peripheral stimuli, was analyzed. Of the 182 participants who answered the survey, the 112 participants with glaucoma included 56 women (50.0%) and had a mean (SD) age of 73.6 (9.6) years. The 70 controls included 49 women (70.0%) and had a mean (SD) age of 68.4 (10.9) years. When asked about mobile telephone use while driving, 30 patients with glaucoma (26.8%) admitted rarely using and 2 (1.8%) sometimes using it. In the control group, 20 participants (28.6%) admitted rarely using and 2 (2.9%) sometimes using the telephone while driving (P=.80). Reaction times to peripheral stimuli were significantly longer among patients with glaucoma compared with controls during mobile telephone use (median [interquartile range], 1.86 [1.42-2.29] seconds vs 1.14 [0.98-1.59] seconds; P=.02). Compared with driving performance while not using a mobile telephone, the mean (SD) increase of 0.85 (0.60) second in reaction time while conversing on the mobile telephone among patients with glaucoma was significantly greater than the mean (SD) increase of 0.68 (0.83) second for controls (P=.03). This study's findings indicate that patients with glaucoma use mobile telephones while driving as frequently as healthy participants. However, the findings also suggest that patients with glaucoma may experience a greater decline than healthy participants in their ability to detect peripheral events while driving when also talking on a mobile telephone. Patients with glaucoma should be informed that they may have a higher driving risk that may be worsened by distractions, such as mobile telephone use. "
[The clinical characteristics and pathologic mechanisms of acute macular neuroretinopathy].,"Health information exchange (HIE) among care providers who cooperate in the treatment of patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) has been rated as an important aspect of successful care. Patient-sharing relations among care providers permit inferences about corresponding information-sharing relations. This study aimed to obtain information for an effective HIE platform design to be used in DM care by analyzing patient-sharing relations among various types of care providers (ToCPs), such as hospitals, pharmacies, and different outpatient specialists, within a nationwide claims dataset of Austrian DM patients. We focus on 2 parameters derived from patient-sharing networks: (1) the principal HIE partners of the different ToCPs involved in the treatment of DM and (2) the required participation rate of ToCPs in HIE platforms for the purpose of effective communication. The claims data of 7.9 million Austrian patients from 2006 to 2007 served as our data source. DM patients were identified by their medication. We established metrics for the quantification of our 2 parameters of interest. The principal HIE partners were derived from the portions of a care provider's patient-sharing relations with different ToCPs. For the required participation rate of ToCPs in an HIE platform, we determine the concentration of patient-sharing relations among ToCPs. Our corresponding metrics are derived in analogy from existing work for the quantification of the continuity of care. We identified 324,703 DM patients treated by 12,226 care providers; the latter were members of 16 ToCPs. On the basis of their score for 2 of our parameters, we categorized the ToCPs into low, medium, and high. For the most important HIE partner parameter, pharmacies, general practitioners (GPs), and laboratories were the representatives of the top group, that is, our care providers shared the highest numbers of DM patients with these ToCPs. For the required participation rate of type of care provide (ToCP) in HIE platform parameter, the concentration of DM patient-sharing relations with a ToCP tended to be inversely related to the ToCPs member count. We conclude that GPs, pharmacies, and laboratories should be core members of any HIE platform that supports DM care, as they are the most important DM patient-sharing partners. We further conclude that, for implementing HIE with ToCPs who have many members (in Austria, particularly GPs and pharmacies), an HIE solution with high participation rates from these ToCPs (ideally a nationwide HIE platform with obligatory participation of the concerned ToCPs) seems essential. This will raise the probability of HIE being achieved with any care provider of these ToCPs. As chronic diseases are rising because of aging societies, we believe that our quantification of HIE requirements in the treatment of DM can provide valuable insights for many industrial countries.

[The status of the application of optical coherence tomography angiography in nonarteritic ischemic optic neuropathy].,"Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) and short-term adverse outcomes have long been recognized; however, survivors remain at risk of long-term complications. We investigated whether HDP is associated with the development of choroidal neovascular age-related macular degeneration (CNV AMD). We identified 31,454 women who experienced HDP based on Utah birth certificates and 62,908 unexposed women matched 2:1 to the exposed. Risk of CNV AMD was estimated using Cox models. Women with HDP exhibited an 80% higher risk for early CNV AMD (age < 70 y; 95%CI 1.23-2.58). Our findings may have implications forearlier CNV AMD screening and detection. "
[Treatment of retinopathy of incontinentia pigmenti by anti-vascular endothelial growth factor].,"The K-Cl cotransporter KCC2 is essential in the development of the ""GABA switch"" that produces a change in neuronal responses to GABA signaling from excitatory to inhibitory early in brain development, and alterations in this progression have previously been hypothesized to play a causal role in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We investigated the KCC2b (Slc12a5) heterozygous knockout mouse using a battery of rodent behavioral tests relevant to core and comorbid ASD symptoms. Compared to wild-type littermates, KCC2<sup>+/-</sup> mice were normal in standard measures of locomotor activity, grooming and digging behaviors, and social, vocalization, and anxiety-like behaviors. However, KCC2<sup>+/-</sup> mice exhibited increased social dominance behaviors and increased amplitude of spontaneous postsynaptic currents in the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC) that were previously implicated in governing social hierarchy and dominance behaviors. Treatment of wild-type mouse brain slices with the KCC2 inhibitor VU0240511 increased the amplitude and frequency of excitatory postsynaptic currents, partially recapitulating the phenotype of KCC2<sup>+/-</sup> mice. These findings indicate that the activity of KCC2 plays a role in social dominance, in parallel with effects on PFC signaling, further suggesting that KCC2 function has some relevance to social behavior but without the breadth of impact on autism-like behavior suggested by previous studies. Further testing could assess whether KCC2 alters other circuits and whether additional factors such as environmental insults may precipitate autism-related behavioral phenotypes. Autism Res 2019,.  2019 International Society for Autism Research,Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: A mouse model of altered chloride transporter expression was used to look for a role in behaviors and brain function relevant to autism. There was an imbalance in signaling in the prefrontal cortex, and increased social dominance behavior, although other autism-related behaviors were not changed. These findings indicate that altered chloride transporter function affects prefrontal cortex function and social dominance without a broader impact on autism-like behaviors. "
[Comparison of intraocular pressure reduction in eyes with different intraocular tamponades after pars plana vitrectomy by 20% mannitol].,"Characterizing the pathogenicity of DNA sequence variants of unknown significance (VUS) is a major bottleneck in human genetics, and is increasingly important in determining which patients with inherited retinal diseases could benefit from gene therapy. A library of 210 rhodopsin (RHO) variants from literature and in-house genetic diagnostic testing was created to efficiently detect pathogenic RHO variants that fail to express on the cell surface. This study, while focused on RHO, demonstrates a streamlined, generalizable method for detecting pathogenic VUS. A relatively simple next generation sequencing (NGS)-based readout was developed so that a flow cytometry-based assay could be performed simultaneously on all variants in a pooled format, without the need for barcodes or viral transduction. The resulting dataset characterized surface expression of every RHO library variant with a high degree of reproducibility (R2=0.92-0.95), recategorizing 37 variants. For example, three retinitis pigmentosa pedigrees were solved by identifying VUS which showed low expression levels (p.G18D, p.G101V, p.P180T). Results were validated across multiple assays and correlated with clinical disease severity. This study presents a parallelized, higher-throughput cell-based assay for the functional characterization of VUS in rhodopsin, and can be applied more broadly to other inherited retinal disease genes and other disorders.

[Quantification of optical coherence tomographic angiography images in type 2 diabetic patients].,"Some ocular diseases, such as dystrophies, retinal and macular degeneration, optic nerve atrophy,and Stargardt disease, are progressive and irreversible. In this review, we focus on the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in the treatment of these diseases.In animal studies, MSC transplantation significantly delayed retinal degeneration, led to the regeneration of cone cells, and supported the survival of retinal ganglion cells and axon regeneration. In clinical practice, patients with Behcet's disease with retinal vasculitis who received MSC injections experienced a decrease in retinal vasculitis but no improvement in vision acuity.Nonetheless, there is no evidence that MSCs are carcinogenic, and they even reduce the size of tumors in vitro. Furthermore, MSCs do not trigger the immune response. "
[The ocular manifestations of human immunodeficiency virus and syphilis coinfection].,"To evaluate the neurotoxic effect of amalgam dental fillings on plasma mercury (Hg) levels and retino-choroidal layers measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Study participants included 56 cases with amalgam dental fillings and 44 healthy controls. All participants were examined in terms of detailed ophthalmic examination, oral examination, and body mass index (BMI). The measurement of retinal layers and choroid was performed using SD-OCT. Venous blood samples were collected and blood Hg levels were measured using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrometric analysis. Correlations between SD-OCT measurement results and blood Hg levels were analyzed. There were no differences between groups in terms of age, sex, or BMI. The mean blood Hg level was 2.76  1.21 g/L in the amalgam group and 2.06  1.15 g/L in the control group ( p = 0.04). The Hg/BMI ratio was 0.12  0.06 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the amalgam group and 0.09  0.05 kg/m<sup>2</sup> in the control group ( p = 0.01). Reduced volumes of ganglion cell layer and inner plexiform layer were observed in the amalgam group when compared with the control group ( p < 0.05). Amalgam dental fillings can cause retinal neurotoxicity. SD-OCT can be useful for evaluating amalgam-related retinal neurotoxicity. "
[Evaluation of the efficacy and safety of a foldable capsular vitreous body in the treatment of severe retinal detachment].,"The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic value of a topical prednisolone acetate 1% provocative test for steroid-induced ocular hypertension before intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injection. This is a prospective, single-center, randomized controlled study at Kasr El Aini Hospital, Cairo University. Patients scheduled for intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide were enrolled and randomly allocated in a ratio 2:1 to either Group A: received prednisolone acetate provocative test and those who did not develop SIOH proceeded with intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide or Group B: did not receive prednisolone acetate provocative test and proceeded directly to intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Intraocular pressures were measured weekly for 4 weeks following intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. Steroid-induced ocular hypertension is defined as intraocular pressure increase of 5 mmHg or more from baseline after prednisolone acetate provocative test or intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. A total of 66 eyes (66 patients) were included. Of which, 10 eyes (23.8%) showed prednisolone acetate provocative test steroid-induced ocular hypertension during the 4-week period. Intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide steroid-induced ocular hypertension was less likely to develop in Group A (prednisolone acetate provocative test non-steroid-induced ocular hypertension, n = 32, 31.25%) than in group B (n = 24, 54.2%) (p = 0.006, odds ratio: 0.178, 95% CI: 0.53-0.596). Our test achieved a negative predictive value of 68.75%. The topical prednisolone acetate provocative test may be a useful method to predict a steroid-induced ocular hypertension following intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide. "
[Be cautious to treat retinopathy of prematurity with anti-vascular endothelial growth factor pharmacotherapy].,"To compare parameters of confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph [HRT] II) in high myopia with age- and sex-matched emmetropes. A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted among Nepalese subjects aged 18 to 35 years at BP Koirala Lions Centre for Ophthalmic Studies, Institute of Medicine, Maharajgunj, Kathmandu from November 2015 to October 2016. Fifty consecutive subjects with high myopia (spherical equivalent ranging from -6.00 to -12.00 diopters) and age- and sex-matched emmetropic subjects were enrolled for comparison. Correlations between disc area and other HRT parameters, asymmetry between the right and left eyes, and comparisons between male and female subjects in both high myopic and emmetropic groups were evaluated. Disc area was not significantly (<i>p</i> = 0.11) larger in high myopic eyes than in emmetropic eyes. HRT parameters in highly myopic eyes involved smaller cup parameters and greater rim parameters compared with emmetropic eyes. Disc area was found to be significantly positively correlated with inter disc parameters and significantly negatively correlated with rim to disc area ratio in the high myopia group. Disc area and other intra-disc parameters showed significant correlations between right and left eyes in both high myopia and emmetropia, and no significant differences between males and females from a Nepalese population. Characteristics of HRT parameters in high myopic eyes involved smaller cup parameters and greater rim parameters compared with emmetropic eyes in a Nepalese population. The effect of disc area on HRT parameters differed significantly only in height variation contour by emmetropic eyes. "
[Efforts to improve the level of clinical diagnosis and treatment of infectious fundus diseases].,"To document the development of disc torsion. Consecutive disc photographs obtained at an interval of at least 1 year were reviewed retrospectively in 173 eyes of 173 Korean children. The angle of the vertical disc axis (AVDA) was measured in each fundus photograph with the fovea-disc center axis set at 0. The associated change in the morphology of the optic disc was assessed by measuring the ratio of the horizontal to vertical disc diameters and the ratio of the maximum parapapillary atrophy width to vertical disc diameter. Eyes were divided into two groups with respect to the development of disc torsion: torsion and non-torsion group. Progressive torsion was defined as a change in AVDA between baseline and follow-up photographs beyond the coefficient of intraobserver repeatab ility. Factors associated with optic disc torsion were evaluated using logistic regression analysis. Mean subject age and refractive error at the time of baseline fundus examination were 6.8  1.7 (range, 2 to 11) years and 0.2  2.6 (range, -6.0 to +5.5) diopters, respectively. Mean follow-up period was 44.8  21.1 (range, 12 to 103) months. Forty-two eyes (24%) were classified as torsion group who showed changes in AVDA that were greater than the intraobserver measurement variability (4.5) during the follow-up period. The development of optic disc torsion was associated with greater myopic shift, a decrease in horizontal to vertical disc diameters, and an increase in parapapillary atrophy width to vertical disc diameter. Progressive optic disc torsion was a common phenomenon in the children included in this study. Torsion occurred as the result of optic disc tilt in an oblique axis in most cases. The findings provide a framework for understanding torsion-related glaucomatous optic nerve damage. "
Very late-onset flap margin corneal ulcer following laser in situ keratomileusis.,"To evaluate contrast sensitivity in patients with Behet's disease (BD) without ocular involvement. The study group was composed of 47 BD patients (20 to 50 years of age) who did not have ocular involvement. The control group was composed of 47 normal volunteers who were similar to the study group in terms of age and gender. No participants in this study had any ocular or systemic pathologies except for BD. The contrast sensitivity measurements were performed using the Functional Acuity Contrast Test under photopic conditions, and the results were compared between the two groups. The mean age of the BD patients and control subjects was 34.5  9.7 and 33.2  7.6 years, respectively. The mean disease duration of the BD patients was 5.5  6.4 years. There was a statistically significant decrease at five spatial frequencies (A, 1.5; B, 3; C, 6; D, 2; and E, 18 cycles per degree) in patients with BD compared with control subjects (<i>p</i> < 0.001, <i>p</i> = 0.004, <i>p</i> = 0.002, <i>p</i> < 0.001, and <i>p</i> = 0.001, respectively). The contrast sensitivity of BD patients without ocular involvement was lower than that of the control group. Further studies seem mandatory to confirm our results. "
Disinhibition of intrinsic photosensitive retinal ganglion cells in patients with X-linked congenital stationary night blindness.,"To investigate the short-term efficacy and safety of ranibizumab in the routine clinical setting in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration and to analyze the associated factors for visual outcome. This was a post-hoc analysis of a ranibizumab regulatory post-marketing surveillance study in which 4,136 patients were enrolled and followed for 12 weeks. Change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), size of choroidal neovascularization, and the presence of hemorrhage and exudate were analyzed and the association between BCVA change and baseline characteristics were investigated. Data on ocular and systemic adverse events were collected. Mean BCVA improved significantly and mean BCVA change was the logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution 0.13  0.01 (<i>p</i> < 0.001). A lower baseline BCVA and younger age were significant predictive factors for visual improvement or maintenance (0 lines). For greater visual acuity gain (3 lines), no treatment history, lower baseline BCVA, younger age, and classic-type choroidal neovascularization were significant predictive factors. No new safety signals were found. In this study, conducted in real-world clinical practice with a large number of neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients, visual and anatomical outcomes improved significantly after three monthly ranibizumab treatments. Treatment-naive patients had a higher chance of greater visual gain (3 lines) than non-naive patients. "
MicroRNA-145 Regulates Pathological Retinal Angiogenesis by Suppression of TMOD3.,"To determine the origin of epiretinal proliferation (EP), a condition that is occasionally observed in lamellar hole and macular hole cases, and EP outcomes after vitrectomy. This is a retrospective observational case review of 17 eyes with EP that underwent vitrectomy, EP dissection, and internal limiting membrane peeling between January 2013 and December 2016. Surgical specimens of EP tissue were successfully obtained from 5 cases and they were analyzed after immunohistochemical staining. Postoperative outcomes, including best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular configuration in spectral domain-optical coherence tomography, were reviewed. Mean BCVA improved from 0.54  0.36 logarithms of the minimum angle of resolution preoperatively to 0.32  0.38 logarithms of the minimum angle of resolution postoperatively (<i>p</i> = 0.002). BCVA improved in 13 eyes and remained unchanged in four eyes. No cases experienced vision decline after surgery. All 17 patients' lamellar hole or macular hole were successfully closed. Despite hole closure, ellipsoid zone defects were not corrected in 11 of the 17 patients. In immunohistochemical analyses, anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein and pan-keratin (AE1/AE3) were positive, but synaptophysin, anti--smooth muscle actin, and anti-CD68 were negative. The epiretinal proliferative membrane seems to originate from Mller cells, not from the vitreous. It is unclear whether retinal pigment epithelia also contribute to EP formation. Gentle handling and preservation of the epiretinal proliferative tissue is crucial for successful surgical outcomes. "
DMEK Failure Associated with Innate Immune Activation.,"We sought to evaluate the outcomes of external dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) and mono-canalicular intubation in patients with total obstruction of one canalicus. Sixteen eyes of 16 patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction and a single canaliculus obstruction who had undergone external DCR and monocanalicular intubation of the intact canaliculus were retrospectively included in the present study. The monocanalicular tube (Mini Monoka) was left in place for at least two months. Munk epiphora grading for the evaluation of epiphora and irrigation was performed both preoperatively and at 6 months postoperatively. Mean patient age was 46  14.2 (range, 18 to 76) years. The inferior canaliculus was obstructed in nine eyes (group A) and the superior canaliculus was obstructed in seven eyes (group B), respectively. Eight eyes had chronic dacryocystitis and two of these eyes also had a history of acute dacryocystitis attack. Mean preoperative Munk scores were 3.89 in group A and 4.0 in group B. Ocular surface irritation occurred in one eye in group A. Artificial eye drops were prescribed and early tube removal was not performed. Spontaneous tube dislocation was recorded in one eye in group B. No other corneal, punctal, or canalicular complications were found. At six months, irrigation of intact canaliculus was patent in all eyes. Mucoid discharge, conjunctival hyperemia, and chronic conjunctivitis were also resolved. Postoperative Munk scores were 1.11  0.9 in group A and 0.86  0.9 in group B. Of note, preoperative and postoperative Munk scores were significantly different in both groups (group A, <i>p</i> = 0.006; group B, <i>p</i> = 0.017). The postoperative Munk scores were not statistically different between the two groups (<i>p</i> = 0.606). In patients with nasolacrimal duct obstruction and a total of one canaliculus obstruction, external DCR and monocanalicular intubation of the intact canaliculus is an effective surgical option. "
"The Relative Impact of Patient, Physician, and Geographic Factors on Variation in Primary Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment Management.","We detected retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) defects using a confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (CSLO) with both blue and green laser sources and evaluated image quality based on laser wavelength. This was a retrospective observational case study. Blue and green CSLO images of 181 eyes with suspected glaucoma were evaluated and compared. Three independent observers identified the presence of RNFL defects and determined which CSLO imaging source provided superior visibility of the defect. After assessing the defect imaging by laser source, demographics and image quality indices of optical coherence tomography between blue better and green better groups were analyzed. Both blue and green CSLO showed high discriminating ability for RNFL defects. The discriminating ability of blue CSLO was significantly greater than that of green CSLO (<i>p</i> = 0.004). Among eyes with a detectable RNFL defect, 61.8% were better visualized with the blue laser compared to the green laser. Compared with the blue better group, the green better group was significantly older (<i>p</i> = 0.009), had a greater proportion of females (<i>p</i> = 0.005), had poorer best-corrected visual acuity (<i>p</i> = 0.001), more severe cataracts (<i>p</i> = 0.001), lower signal strength (<i>p</i> = 0.003), and poor image quality indices (<i>p</i> = 0.001). Both blue and green CSLO imaging was useful for detecting RNFL defects, but blue CSLO was superior to green CSLO in quality of RNFL defect imaging in most patients with clear media. "
Google searches and detection of conjunctivitis epidemics worldwide.,"To evaluate the efficacy of switching to aflibercept in diabetic macular edema (DME) with suboptimal response to previous anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. A prospective interventional case series study recruited patients from a single center diagnosed with DME with suboptimal response to anti-VEGF injections. Three consecutive monthly injections of aflibercept were performed. The primary outcome measure was mean change in visual acuity after switching to aflibercept. Forty-two patients (42 eyes) were included. Baseline logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) visual acuity was 0.87  0.23 and improved significantly to 0.62  0.29, 0.56  0.34, and 0.46  0.35 at 1, 2, and 3 months, respectively, after the first injection. Mean baseline retinal thickness was 451.57  107.09 m and decreased significantly at 1, 2, and 3 months after switching to aflibercept (346.52  79.03, 328.24  81.98, and 313.71  85.79 m, respectively). Both visual improvement and mean change in retinal thickness were significant in patients with pre-aflibercept best-corrected visual acuity less than 1.0 logMAR but were not significant in patients with best-corrected visual acuity more than 1.0 logMAR. Switching to aflibercept in DME patients with an unsatisfactory response to previous anti-VEGF injections provided acceptable short-term visual and retinal architectural improvement. "
Anticoagulation: a practical guide for strabismus surgeons.,"To evaluate laser <i>in situ</i> keratomileusis (LASIK) flap thickness predictability and morphology by femtosecond (FS) laser and microkeratome (MK) using anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Fifty-two candidates for the LASIK procedure were stratified into two groups: FS laser-assisted (Allegretto FS-200) and MK flap creation (Moria 2). Flap thickness was determined at five points. The side-cut angle was measured in three directions at the margin interface. LASIK flap assessment was performed one month postoperatively by Spectralis anterior segment optical coherence tomography. Fifty-two patients (93 eyes) were recruited; 49 eyes were stratified to the FS group and 44 eyes to the MK group. The FS group had relatively even flap configurations, and the MK group had meniscus-shaped flaps. Mean differences between planned and actual flap thickness were 12.93  8.89 and 19.91  5.77 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively. In thin flaps (100 to 110 m), there was a significant disparity between the two groups (7.80  4.71 and 19.44  4.46 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively). However, in thicker flaps (130 m), comparable flap thickness disparity was achieved (18.54  9.52 and 20.83  5.99 m in the FS and MK groups, respectively). Mean side-cut angle was 74.29  5.79 degrees and 32.34  4.94 degrees in the FS and MK groups, respectively. Comparable flap thickness predictability was achieved in thicker flaps (130 m), while the FS laser technique yielded a more predictable result in thinner flaps (100 to 110 m). Different flap morphology was observed in meniscus flaps in MK-LASIK and flap morphology in FS-LASIK. "
The influence of meibomian gland loss on ocular surface clinical parameters.,"To assess the clinical efficacy for early detection of glaucoma using custom-built image software visualizing translucent retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) that is graphed based on a normative database. This prospective study was conducted using a normative database constructed with RNFLT data of 151 healthy Korean eyes. The reference lines of the mean, the lower 5%, and the lower 1% limit were visualized as a translucent RNFLT graph produced by our software after inputting each subject's major retinal artery position and overlaying the results onto the RNFLT measurements. Fifty-eight additional healthy control and 79 early-glaucoma eyes were collected for the validation group. If a subject's RNFLT graph was outside the reference line of the lower 1% limit, the graph was defined as abnormal. The lower 1% limit, which was generated by three criteria (criterion 1, built-in software; criterion 2, axial-length data; criterion 3, major retinal artery data), was used to address the difference of agreement with a standard answer. For criteria 1, 2, and 3, the accuracy of our custom-built software was significantly higher than that of the manufacturer's database (kappa of 0.475 vs. 0.852 vs. 0.940; sensitivity of 62.0% vs. 91.1% vs. 97.5%, respectively) maintaining high specificity (87.9% vs. 94.8% vs. 96.6%, respectively). The custom-built imaging software with the constructed RNFLT normative database showed high clinical efficiency for early detection of glaucoma with negligible user-related variability. "
Ophthalmologic aspects of Dermatofibrosarcoma Protuberans: A systematic review in the context of a rare case of primary orbital involvement.,"A 3-year-old French bulldog was presented to the ophthalmology service of the Vetsuisse Faculty, University of Zurich with a 3-day history of conjunctival swelling of the left eye (OS). Ophthalmologic examination revealed a moderate conjunctival hyperemia and chemosis. A migrating foreign body having entered the conjunctival fornix behind the nictitating membrane was suspected. Within the first 24hours of medical management, OS developed a panuveitis and a scleral perforation was highly suspected. Ocular and orbital ultrasound as well as conventional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations failed to confirm the presence of a perforating foreign body. A High-Resolution MRI (HR-MRI) using a microscopy coil was then performed with findings consistent with a perforating and migrating foreign body. A grass awn of 12mm length was surgically retrieved ""ab externo"" from its\' point of entry into the sclera. To the best of our knowledge, HR-MRI has not yet been used to examine canine eyes. This case report supports the idea that orbital imaging can be greatly enhanced with the introduction of HR-MRI using microscopy coils with clinically relevant implications. "
Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder in a tertiary hospital in the Philippines: a case series.,"Uncommon characteristics in genetically unsolved retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients may indicate an incorrect clinical diagnosis or as yet unknown genetic causes resulting in specific retinal phenotypes. The diagnostic yield of targeted next-generation sequencing may be increased by a reasonable preselection of RP-patients. To systematically evaluate and compare features of genetically solved and unsolved RP-patients. Retrospective, observational study. One-hundred-twelve consecutive RP-patients who underwent extensive molecular genetic analysis. Characterization of patients by multimodal imaging and medical history. Differences between genetically solved and unsolved RP-patients RESULTS: Compared to genetically solved patients (n=77), genetically unsolved patients (n=35) more frequently had an age of disease-onset above 30 years (60% vs. 8%; p<0.0001), showed atypical fundus features (49% vs. 8%; p<0. 0001) and indicators for phenocopies (e.g. autoimmune diseases) (17% vs. 0%; p<0. 001). Evidence for a particular inheritance pattern was less common (20% vs. 49%; p<0. 01). The diagnostic yield was 84% (71/85) in patients with first symptoms below 30 years-of-age, compared to 69% (77/112) in the overall cohort. The other selection criteria alone or in combination resulted in limited further increase of the diagnostic yield (up to 89%) while excluding considerably more patients (up to 56%) from genetic testing. The disease history and retinal phenotype differ between genetically solved and a subgroup of unsolved RP-patients, which may reflect undetected genotypes or retinal conditions mimicking RP. Patient stratification may inform on the individual likelihood of identifying disease-causing mutations and may impact patient counselling. "
Update on Intraocular Lens Calculation Formulas.,"Objective assessment of intraoperative technical skill is necessary for technology to improve patient care through surgical training. Our objective in this study was to develop and validate deep learning techniques for technical skill assessment using videos of the surgical field. We used a data set of 99 videos of capsulorhexis, a critical step in cataract surgery. One expert surgeon annotated each video for technical skill using a standard structured rating scale, the International Council of Ophthalmology's Ophthalmology Surgical Competency Assessment Rubric:phacoemulsification (ICO-OSCAR:phaco). Using two capsulorhexis indices in this scale (commencement of flap and follow-through, formation and completion), we specified an expert performance when at least one of the indices was 5 and the other index was at least 4, and novice otherwise. In addition, we used scores for capsulorhexis commencement and capsulorhexis formation as separate ground truths (Likert scale of 2 to 5; analyzed as 2/3, 4 and 5). We crowdsourced annotations of instrument tips. We separately modeled instrument trajectories and optical flow using temporal convolutional neural networks to predict a skill class (expert/novice) and score on each item for capsulorhexis in ICO-OSCAR:phaco. We evaluated the algorithms in a five-fold cross-validation and computed accuracy and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC). The accuracy and AUC were 0.848 and 0.863 for instrument tip velocities, and 0.634 and 0.803 for optical flow fields, respectively. Deep neural networks effectively model surgical technical skill in capsulorhexis given structured representation of intraoperative data such as optical flow fields extracted from video or crowdsourced tool localization information.

3D in vitro model for human corneal endothelial cell maturation.,"To evaluate accumulation patterns of deposits in retinal layers of type B Niemann-Pick patients by multimodal imaging. Seven patients with type B Niemann-Pick disease were included in this study. All participants underwent a complete ophthalmologic evaluation, high-resolution digital colour imaging, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, blue light fundus autofluorescence and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). We demonstrated different accumulation patterns in the retinal ganglion cell layer, the retinal nerve fibre layer and the subfoveolar region by multimodal imaging. Local retinal capillary nonflow areas in the superficial plexus, increased vascular tortuosity and deformed foveal avascular areas were shown in OCTA scans. Multimodal imaging including OCTA is a useful technique for the identification of different types of accumulation patterns, diagnosis and follow-up of type B Niemann-Pick patients. "
High-throughput screening identifies compounds that protect RPE cells from physiological stressors present in AMD.,"D190N, a missense mutation in rhodopsin, causes photoreceptor degeneration in patients with autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP). Two competing hypotheses have been developed to explain why D190N rod photoreceptors degenerate: (a) defective rhodopsin trafficking prevents proteins from correctly exiting the endoplasmic reticulum, leading to their accumulation, with deleterious effects or (b) elevated mutant rhodopsin expression and unabated signaling causes excitotoxicity. A knock-in D190N mouse model was engineered to delineate the mechanism of pathogenesis. Wild type (wt) and mutant rhodopsin appeared correctly localized in rod outer segments of D190N heterozygotes. Moreover, the rhodopsin glycosylation state in the mutants appeared similar to that in wt mice. Thus, it seems plausible that the injurious effect of the heterozygous mutation is not related to mistrafficking of the protein, but rather from constitutive rhodopsin activity and a greater propensity for chromophore isomerization even in the absence of light. "
Upregulated VEGF and Robo4 correlate with the reduction of miR-15a in the development of diabetic retinopathy.,"Spontaneous resolution of myopic retinoschisis is an unusual event due to the fact that most eyes of patients with this condition have already undergone certain morphological changes and vision will progressively worsen over time. We present a case of spontaneous anatomic and visual improvement in a myopic eye with a macular retinoschisis. The patient was monocular oculus dextrus (OD) with a history of left eye enucleation for recurrent retinal detachment and glaucoma for 30 years prior. Recent optical coherence tomography (OCT) depicted features characteristic of myopic retinoschisis. At the same time, the patient sough chiropractic treatment for neck pain and numbness in upper limbs. The patient had received 12 sessions of cervical adjustment which helped attain symptomatic relief of her neck and upper limb complaints at which time the patient also reported substantial recovery in her vision. Restoration of the normal retinal morphological appearance was illustrated upon re-evaluation of OCT. Spontaneous resolution of myopic retinoschisis may be a multifactorial cause. Further studies elucidating the exact mechanism resulting in visual improvement after chiropractic adjustment are needed before any claims regarding its efficacy for the treatment of myopic retinoschisis can be made. "
Macular function following intravitreal ranibizumab for macular edema associated with branch retinal vein occlusion.,"To describe the clinical and electrophysiological features of an unusual retinopathy in a patient with a novel genotype of <i>CNGB1</i>, mutations in which are implicated in autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (rod-cone dystrophy). A 61-year old asymptomatic woman was referred to the inherited retinal disorders clinic because of peripheral retinal pigmentary changes. She had normal visual acuity and color vision. Clinical examination and detailed imaging of the macula were normal, but there was atrophy of the outer retina in the periphery with sparse intra-retinal pigmentation. Electroretinography (ERG) revealed undetectable rod responses, with normal cone-mediated responses. The pattern ERG was normal. Genetic analysis identified two previously unreported variants in <i>CNGB1</i>: (c.2258T>A, p.[Leu753*] and c.807G>C, p.[Gln269His]), shown to be <i>in trans</i>. This report describes a functionally cone-isolated retina in an adult, apparently hemizygous for a novel missense mutation in <i>CNGB1</i>, a novel phenotype for this gene. The p.[Gln269His] allele is the first missense change, within the glutamic acid-rich protein (GARP) domain of CNGB1, to be associated with retinal disease in humans. "
[Do children with strabismus receive ophthalmic treatment? : Results from the KiGGS (German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents) baseline survey (2003-2006)].,"Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) are multipotent mesenchymal progenitor cells that have functional and phenotypic overlap with pericytes lining microvessels in adipose tissue. The role of CD140b [platelet-derived growth factor receptor-  (PDGFR-)], a constitutive marker expressed by ASCs, in the angiogenic behavior of human retinal endothelial cells (HREs) is not known. CD140b was knocked down in ASCs using targeted siRNA and lipofectamine transfection protocol. Both CD140b+ and CD140b- ASCs were tested for their proliferation (WST-1 reagent), adhesion (laminin-1 coated plates), and migration (wound-scratch assay). Angiogenic effect of CD140b+ and CD140b- ASCs on HREs was examined by co-culturing ASCs:HREs in 12:1 ratio for 6 days followed by visualization of vascular network by Isolectin B4 staining. The RayBio Membrane-Based Antibody Array was used to assess differences in human cytokines released by CD140b+ or CD140b- ASCs. Knockdown of CD140b in ASCs resulted in a significant 50% decrease in proliferation rate, 25% decrease in adhesion ability to Laminin-1, and 50% decrease in migration rate, as compared to CD140b+ ASCs. Direct contact of ASCs expressing CD140b+ with HREs resulted in robust vascular network formation that was significantly reduced with using CD140b- ASCs. Of the 80 proteins tested, 45 proteins remained unchanged (>0.5-<1.5 fold), 6 proteins including IL-10 downregulated (<0.5 fold) and 29 proteins including IL-16 & TNF- were upregulated (>1.5 fold) in CD140b- ASCs compared to CD140b+ ASCs. Our data demonstrate a substantial role for CD140b in the intrinsic abilities of ASCs and their angiogenic influence on HREs. Future studies are needed to fully explore the signaling of CD140b in ASCs <i>in vivo</i> for retinal regeneration. "
Relation between Baseline Total Serum Cortisol Level and Outcome in Pediatric Intensive Care Unit.,"To report our 5-year experience with intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) in the intravitreal chemotherapy (IvitC) era. Retrospective review of retinoblastoma treated with primary unilateral IAC in the IvitC era (2012-2017). There were 34 eyes treated with IAC alone versus 20 eyes treated with IAC plus IvitC for vitreous seeds. IAC (IAC alone vs. IAC plus IvitC) consisted of melphalan (41 vs. 10%) or melphalan plus topotecan (59 vs. 90%, <i>p</i> = 0.03). IvitC consisted of melphalan (60%) or melphalan plus topotecan (40%). Tumor control and globe salvage were achieved in 100% of group B and C eyes without IvitC. Despite more extensive vitreous seeds in the IvitC group (<i>p</i> < 0.01), comparison of IAC alone versus IAC plus IvitC revealed no difference in tumor control for group D (88 vs. 69%, <i>p</i> = 0.36) or group E (67 vs. 100%, <i>p</i> = 0.25) and no difference in globe salvage for group D (88 vs. 69%, <i>p</i> = 0.36) or group E (58 vs. 57%, <i>p</i> = 0.39). IAC is effective as primary therapy for unilateral group B, C, D, and E retinoblastoma. IvitC is an important adjuvant therapy to achieve comparable globe salvage rates for group D and E eyes with persistent active vitreous seeds. "
Effects of three intravitreal injections of aflibercept on the ocular circulation in eyes with age-related maculopathy.,"To report a case of metastatic cutaneous melanoma presenting with choroidal metastasis simulating primary uveal melanoma. Case report. Presentation of clinical, radiographic, histopathologic, and tumor genetic findings in a patient with cutaneous melanoma with choroidal metastasis. A 50-year-old man with a remote history of stage 1A cutaneous melanoma presented with eye pain, peripheral vision loss, floaters, red eye, and choroidal mass that was originally diagnosed as a primary uveal melanoma at an outside institution; however, subsequent imaging and clinical evaluation demonstrated that this choroidal mass was the first manifestation of widely metastatic cutaneous melanoma (liver, pancreas, lung, bone, brain, and orbit lesions). Histopathologic analysis of the tumor after enucleation was consistent with cutaneous melanoma, and tumor genetic testing was positive for <i>BRAF</i> V600E mutation, confirming the choroidal lesion to be a cutaneous melanoma metastasis rather than a primary choroidal melanoma. Metastatic cutaneous melanoma to the orbit or globe occurs rarely. Tumor genetic testing may help differentiate metastatic cutaneous melanoma from primary uveal melanoma in cases where the diagnosis is uncertain, and can also inform therapy and prognostic counseling.

"Detailed clinical characterisation, unique features and natural history of autosomal recessive <i>RDH12</i>-associated retinal degeneration.","Rosai-Dorfman disease (RDD) is a rare, self-limited disorder of unknown etiology that affects children and young adults worldwide and typically manifests as chronic, painless cervical lymphadenopathy. Orbital involvement is very rare and may be an isolated extranodal manifestation or associated with concurrent systemic disease. Adjacent bone involvement is most exceptional, and secondary optic neuropathy has never been reported. This is a case report with review of the literature. We present a 32-year-old man who, over a 3-month period, developed worsening vision, headache, and vertical diplopia. On examination, there was decreased vision with dyschromatopsia, proptosis, and hypotropia of the left eye. CT scan of the orbits revealed a soft tissue mass inseparable from the lacrimal gland with adjacent bone erosion. Histopathologic evaluation revealed a diffuse infiltrate of histiocytes, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and neutrophils with peripolesis and emperipolesis (tunneling of lymphocytes and plasma cells in the histiocytes' cytoplasm without destruction), consistent with RDD. Resolution of symptoms as well as of the optic neuropathy was achieved with oral corticosteroids. RDD is an important diagnosis that must be considered in the differential diagnosis of an orbital mass. "
Early diagnostic parameters of glaucoma in high myopes.,"A 60-year-old male presented with an increasingly painful and swollen phthisical eye. Enucleation revealed a large mass obliterating the eye with extension into the adjacent extraocular muscle. Histologic examination showed high-grade osteosarcoma. Systemic work-up showed no disease elsewhere, and a diagnosis of orbital extraskeletal osteosarcoma was rendered. Complete resection was not possible, and neoadjuvant radiation was given. The patient subsequently developed pulmonary metastasis and died of disease 5 months after initial diagnosis. Given the highly aggressive nature of this malignancy, raising awareness that extraskeletal osteosarcoma may arise in the background of phthisis bulbi will facilitate timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment. "
[Can Big Data change our practices?],"To report a case of ocular cystinosis diagnosed by anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) and histopathology. A 67-year-old man who presented with eye pain was found to have unilateral corneal crystal deposition. Ocular cystinosis was diagnosed by histopathology, AS-OCT, and lack of renal involvement of the disease. AS-OCT showed hyperreflective densities in the corneal epithelium. The patient underwent superficial keratectomy given irregular astigmatism prior to cataract surgery. Electron microscopy of the corneal scrapings revealed epithelial cells with intracystoplasmic membrane-bound crystals confirming the diagnosis of cystinosis. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case of ocular cystinosis involving strictly the epithelial layer of the cornea that has been imaged by AS-OCT. "
Assessment of physiological upper eyelid laxity.,"To describe our early experience with gene expression profiling (GEP) assessment for juxtafoveal, subfoveal, and peripapillary indeterminate high-risk melanocytic lesions to assist in making early treatment decisions in patients who did not feel comfortable with either close observation or definitive treatment. A prospective cohort of patients with indeterminate lesions who underwent GEP were enrolled. Nonparametric statistical analysis was utilized given the small sample size. Fifteen patients were included in this series. Six (40%) were class 1A and 9 (60%) class 1B. Class 1A and 1B lesions had a median of three and four clinical risk factors, respectively (<i>p</i> = 0.27). There was no statistically significant difference for the largest basal diameter between the classes (<i>p</i> = 0.31); however, class 1B lesions were thicker than class 1A lesions (<i>p</i> = 0.03). None of the class 1A lesions showed definite growth or metastasis over a mean follow-up period of 17.1  1.8 months from fine needle aspiration biopsy. All class 1B patients opted for plaque brachytherapy, and to date none of these patients have developed metastasis, with a mean follow-up of 18.7  8.4 months. There may be a role for GEP assessment in high-risk, indeterminate, posteriorly located choroidal lesions to assist in treatment planning. "
Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis without initial trauma: A rare case report.,"Cutaneous histiocytoid carcinoma can occur as a primary tumor of the periocular region. Morphologically similar histiocytoid carcinomas arising as primary tumors of the breast have a predilection for orbital metastases. They can occasionally contain regions with prominent vacuolated cytoplasm and minimal nuclear atypia, which mimic benign histiocytic lesions. Differentiating nonneoplastic, primary neoplastic, and metastatic histiocytoid lesions involving the periorbita can be challenging for both the clinician and the pathologist, and this distinction has management implications. Herein, we present 3 cases to illustrate the challenges of diagnosing periocular histiocytoid carcinoma. "
Sensorimotor Control in Dystonia.,"To describe the clinical and histopathological features of an aggressive ciliary body adenocarcinoma with pulmonary metastases and skull base spread. A 45-year-old female patient presented with a post-traumatic phthisical eye that was eviscerated. This showed an unexpected carcinoma (positive for cytokeratins and melanocytic markers), the histological differential diagnosis for which included a primary ciliary body adenocarcinoma or a metastasis. The patient developed rapid post-surgical localized recurrence that required an orbital exenteration. This showed identical tumour to the evisceration specimen, with vascular invasion in orbital blood vessels and a contaminated orbital soft tissue margin. Staging imaging revealed multiple lung metastases, which were biopsied and shown to be a disseminated ciliary body adenocarcinoma rather than a disseminated primary lung carcinoma. The tumour spread locally to the skull base for which radiotherapy was given. Unfortunately, the patient passed away a few weeks later. To our knowledge, this is the first case of ciliary body adenocarcinoma with bilateral lung metastases. The malignant potential of these tumours should be considered as a possibility, and appropriate screening and staging tests should therefore be considered to guide appropriate management. "
Emergent radiation for leukemic optic nerve infiltration in a child receiving intrathecal methotrexate.,"The aim of this review is to summarize developments in the treatment of active polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). PCV is associated with a poor visual prognosis as a consequence the condition's hallmark polypoidal dilatation and a branching network resulting in recurrent hemorrhages and serous leakage. Recent research has provided new insights into the pathogenesis of PCV. While still considered a subtype of age-related macular degeneration, suggestions that PCV belongs to a spectrum of conditions that present with a pachychoroid are increasingly well accepted. Treatment remains challenging. Combination therapy (photodynamic therapy (PDT) and intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)) is associated with higher polyp closure rate, but polyp closure rate has not been correlated with superior visual outcomes. Current data points to non-inferiority of anti-VEGF alone versus combined with PDT when final vision acuity is the study outcome. PCV remains a clinical challenge. Classification and treatment of the condition continues to evolve. Combination therapy may not be superior to anti-VEGF treatment alone in terms of visual acuity outcome, however data on long-term recurrence should be compared in formulating preferred treatment plans.

Widespread gene transfer to malignant gliomas with In vitro-to-In vivo correlation.,Cataract is an opacification of the lens. Pediatric cataracts can be congenital or acquired. Acquired cataract including the one caused by corticosteroid used. It occurred as bilateral posterior subcapsular cataracts and tended to be progressive. Treatment of choice is lens extraction with or without intraocular lens (IOL). We present a case of posterior subcapsular cataract that occurs in a patient with Langerhans cell histiocytosis that was using corticosteroid therapy. The routine ophthalmologic examination should be performed in children who received treatment with corticosteroids in the long term so that with early detection it can be given early treatment. 
Effect of somatostatin on human retinal pigment epithelial cells permeability.,"Prevalence of many eye and ocular surface diseases increases with age. While the clinical characteristics and pathophysiologic mechanisms of these conditions are often either known or extensively studied, the effects of normal aging on tear film and ocular surface have not been as widely researched. In order to examine the effects of aging on tear fluid proteomics, tear fluid samples were collected preoperatively from 115 subjects undergoing strabismus or refractive surgery using glass microcapillary tubes. In addition to their refractive error or strabismus, the subjects did not have any other current, known eye diseases. The non-pooled samples were analysed using NanoLC-TripleTOF implementing a sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ion spectra mass spectrometry, resulting in quantified data of 849 proteins. According to correlation results, 17 tear proteins correlated significantly with increased age and many of these proteins were connected to inflammation, immune response and cell death. According to enrichment analysis, growth and survival of cells decreased while immune response and inflammation increased with aging. We also discovered several well-known, activated and inhibited upstream regulators, e.g. NF-B, which has been previously connected to aging in numerous previous studies. Overall, the results show the common age-dependent alterations in tear fluid protein profile, which demonstrate similar age-associated alterations of biological functions previously shown in other tissue and sample types. "
Heterogeneity of cultured melanocyte elongation and proliferation factor in bilateral diffuse uveal melanocytic proliferation.,"The transforming growth factor-beta (TGF) signaling pathway is essential for palatogenesis and retinal development. Glycoprotein A repetitions predominant (GARP), encoded by LRRC32, is a TGF cell surface receptor that has been studied primarily in the context of cellular immunity. We identified a homozygous stop-gain variant in LRRC32 (c.1630C>T; p.(Arg544Ter)) in two families with developmental delay, cleft palate, and proliferative retinopathy. Garp-null mice have palate defects and die within 24h after birth. Our study establishes LRRC32 as a candidate disease-associated gene in humans and lends further support to the role of the TGF pathway in palatogenesis and retinal development. "
"Neurothekeoma of the eye, conjunctiva and periorbital adnexa. Report of two cases and brief review.","The secreted Ly-6/uPAR Related Protein-1 (SLURP1) is an immunomodulatory protein that promotes corneal immune- and angiogenic-privilege. Here, we have examined the influence of SLURP1 on neutrophil-vascular endothelial cell interactions using human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) and differentiated neutrophil-like HL-60 (dHL-60) cells, or primary human neutrophils. SLURP1 blocked the tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-)-activated dHL-60 cells (i) binding to TNF--activated HUVEC with a concurrent reduction in endothelial cell adhesion molecule E-selectin, (ii) transmigration through TNF--activated confluent HUVEC monolayer by stabilizing VE-cadherin and -catenin on endothelial cell cytoplasmic membranes, (iii) chemotaxis towards chemoattractant formyl Met-Leu-Phe (fMLP) coupled with their decreased polarization, and (iv) TNF--stimulated matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP9) expression and activity. SLURP1 also suppressed the primary human neutrophil chemotaxis, and interaction with HUVEC. Furthermore, SLURP1 suppressed fMLP-induced phosphorylation of protein kinase-B (AKT) in dHL-60 cells. Collectively, these results provide evidence that SLURP1 suppresses neutrophil (i) docking on HUVEC cells by decreasing endothelial cell adhesion molecule E-Selectin production, (ii) transmigration through HUVEC monolayer by stabilizing endothelial cell membrane localization of VE-cadherin and -catenin complex and promoting their barrier function, and (iii) chemotaxis by modulating their polarization and TNF--stimulated MMP9 production.

Referral to community care from school-based eye care programs in the United States.,"Multimodal imaging with photoacoustic microscopy (PAM) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be an effective method to evaluate the choroidal and retinal microvasculature. To improve the efficiency for visualizing capillaries, colloidal gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been applied as a multimodal contrast agent for both OCT and PAM imaging by taking advantage of the strong optical scattering and the strong optical absorption of AuNPs due to their surface plasmon resonance. Ultra-pure AuNPs were fabricated by femtosecond laser ablation, capped with polyethylene glycol (PEG), and administered to 13 New Zealand white rabbits and 3 Dutch Belted pigmented rabbits. The synthesized PEG-AuNPs (20.01.5nm) were demonstrated to be excellent contrast agents for PAM and OCT, and do not demonstrate cytotoxicity to bovine retinal endothelial cells in cell studies. The image signal from the retinal and choroidal vessels in living rabbits was enhanced by up to 82% for PAM and up to 45% for OCT, respectively, by the administered PEG-AuNPs, which enables detection of individual blood vessels by both imaging modalities. The biodistribution study demonstrated the AuNP accumulated primarily in the liver and spleen. Histology and TUNEL staining did not indicate cell injury or death in the lung, liver, kidney, spleen, heart, or eyes up to seven days after AuNP administration. PEG-AuNPs offer an efficient and safe contrast agent for multimodal ocular imaging to achieve improved characterization of microvasculature. "
Beware of the Sneeze.,"Obesity affects many organ systems. There have been few studies on the ophthalmological effects of obesity. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the changes in the ophthalmological parameters in obese children. The study included 61 obese and 35 age-and gender-matched control subjects. Obesity was defined as body mass index-standard deviation score (BMI-SDS) >2 SD. Children with a BMI-SDS between >-1 SD and <+1 SD whilst otherwise healthy were recruited as the control group. All clinical and ophthalmological investigations were performed by a pediatric endocrinologist and an experienced ophthalmologist. The ophthalmological examination and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement was performed. The average retinal fiber layer (RNFL), retinal ganglion cell (RGC), central macular thickness (CMT), cup-to-disk ratio (C/D), and central choroidal thickness (CT) were measured using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. The anthropometric, biochemical, and ophthalmological parameters of the obese and control subjects were compared. IOP was higher in the obese group compared to the control group (P = 0.008), whereas the average RNFL was lower in the obese group (P = 0.035). There was a negative correlation between the average RNFL and BMI-SDS (P = -0.044) and waist-hip ratio (P = 0.015). There was no statistically significant difference between the RGC, C/D, CMT, and CT of the obese and control groups. IOP was negatively correlated with HOMA-IR, body fat mass, body fat percentage, and diastolic blood pressure. In the present study, which evaluated obesity and its effects on ophthalmological parameters, the elevated IOP and decreased RNFL thickness detected in the obese group may suggest an increased risk for these patients of developing glaucoma at a younger age. Therefore, regular ophthalmological examinations of obese children are essential for prompt diagnosis and appropriate management. "
Mapping mRNA expression of glaucoma genes in the healthy mouse eye.,"The photoreceptor outer segment is the most elaborate primary cilium, containing large amounts of rhodopsin (RHO) in disk membranes that grow from a connecting cilium. The movement of RHO along the connecting cilium precedes formation of the disk membranes. However, the route that RHO takes has not been clearly determined; some reports suggest that it follows an intracellular, vesicular route along the axoneme, possibly as an adaptation for the high load of delivery or the morphogenesis of the disk endomembranes. We addressed this question by studying RHO in cilia of IMCD3 cells and mouse rod photoreceptors. In IMCD3 cilia, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) experiments with fluorescently-tagged RHO supported RHO motility in the ciliary plasma membrane and was inconsistent with RHO motility within the lumen of the cilium. In rod photoreceptors, FRAP of RHO-EGFP was altered by externally-applied lectin, supporting plasmalemmal RHO dynamics. Quantitative immunoEM corroborated our live cell conclusions, detecting RHO distributed along the plasma membrane of the connecting cilium, with negligible labeling within the axoneme. Together, the present findings demonstrate RHO trafficking entirely via the ciliary plasma membrane. "
Growth of Endothelial Cells in Space and in Simulated Microgravity - a Comparison on the Secretory Level.,"We report a case of a 41-year-old woman, wearer of contact lenses who was presented to the emergency room with a 2-month history of pain and red eye. She presented with a severe keratitis refractory to quinolones, fortified antibiotics and clotrimazole. Due to the risk of perforation, a tectonic penetrating keratoplasty (PK) was performed. Clinical signs of keratitis recurrence were observed and cultures were positive for <i>Purpureocillium lilacinum (</i>former <i>Paecilomyces lilacinus)</i> The patient did not improve on topical amphotericin B and intracameral voriconazole. Worsening of clinical condition required a new PK. Oral posaconazole was initiated postoperatively and suspended at the fourth postoperative month. The cornea remains clear until the last follow-up visit, 12 months after the second graft. To our knowledge, this is the second case report that documents the effectiveness of oral posaconazole in a refractory <i>P. lilacinus</i> keratitis, resistant to other second-generation triazoles and conventional antifungals.

Frontline Science: Aggregated neutrophil extracellular traps prevent inflammation on the neutrophil-rich ocular surface.,"Calcium imaging records large-scale neuronal activity with cellular resolution in vivo. Automated, fast, and reliable active neuron segmentation is a critical step in the analysis workflow of utilizing neuronal signals in real-time behavioral studies for discovery of neuronal coding properties. Here, to exploit the full spatiotemporal information in two-photon calcium imaging movies, we propose a 3D convolutional neural network to identify and segment active neurons. By utilizing a variety of two-photon microscopy datasets, we show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques and is on a par with manual segmentation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the network trained on data recorded at a specific cortical layer can be used to accurately segment active neurons from another layer with different neuron density. Finally, our work documents significant tabulation flaws in one of the most cited and active online scientific challenges in neuron segmentation. As our computationally fast method is an invaluable tool for a large spectrum of real-time optogenetic experiments, we have made our open-source software and carefully annotated dataset freely available online.

Mobile Telephone Use and Reaction Time in Drivers With Glaucoma.,"To evaluate the medical-surgical management of cataract surgery in children with chronic uveitis in various French pediatric ophthalmology centers. Two-part study: first, a descriptive observational segment on the evaluation of French practices. A questionnaire was sent to the various pediatric ophthalmologists in France. A second retrospective chart review, including children with non-infectious chronic uveitis who had cataract surgery in the pediatric ophthalmology department of Bordeaux University Hospital from 2008 to 2017. Twenty-one ophthalmologists responded to the questionnaire. Only 23.8% systematically initiated immunosuppressive drugs (aside from corticosteroids) before surgery. A total of 88.2% prescribed oral corticosteroid treatment preoperatively. Eleven surgeons administered intravenous corticosteroid boluses during the surgery, and primary lens implantation is the most common method used in 95.2%. A total of 76.2% initiated oral steroid therapy after surgery. Postoperatively, all surgeons started local therapy with high-dose corticosteroids. At one year, 100% achieved improvement of visual acuity greater than or equal to 2 lines. On our service, 10 eyes (7 children) underwent cataract surgery. Seven were treated with systemic immunosuppressive drugs (aside from corticosteroids) and 80% of cases received oral corticosteroid therapy a few days before surgery. An intravenous corticosteroid bolus was administered preoperatively in 8 cases, and primary lens implantation was performed in 100% of cases. Postoperatively, 5 children received oral corticosteroid treatment. All were treated with local high dose steroids. At one year, the mean best-corrected visual acuity was 0.18 LogMar (0-0.7, SD: 0.25). When performed with an aggressive anti-inflammatory protocol, cataract surgery leads to a good visual outcome in selected children with chronic uveitis. "
Patient-Sharing Relations in the Treatment of Diabetes and Their Implications for Health Information Exchange: Claims-Based Analysis.,"To develop a methodology to correlate optical coherence tomography (OCT) images and histopathological sections from the same eye. Part 1: To determine the best fixative for optimal OCT and histopathological analysis in post-mortem eyes. Part 2: A protocol is proposed to correlate histopathological features and OCT scans from the same post-mortem eyes. Experimental study. Part 1: Twenty-three rabbit eyes and 14 post-mortem human eyes. Part 2: Nineteen post-mortem human eyes. Part 1: Six different fixatives were tested, and specimens were evaluated on 4 criteria: globe shape, structure opacification, retinal detachment, and nuclear details. Part 2: Based on the findings from Part 1, fixed human eyes were imaged using OCT. Orientation-controlled histopathological processing was performed to obtain serial tissue sections from paraffin embedded tissue, which were matched to corresponding OCT images. Part 1: Of the 6 fixatives, 2% glutaraldehyde and Davidson's solution met the proposed criteria in rabbit eyes. Of these, glutaraldehyde showed similar results in human eyes and was selected for Part 2. Part 2: Using anatomical landmarks, cross-sectional histopathological sections in the same orientation as the OCT images were correlated to their corresponding OCT images. Retinal lesions such as a macular hole, an epiretinal membrane, and the presence of drusen were easily correlated, proving the reliability of our methodology. Moreover, the photoreceptor's inner/outer junction was correlated to a hyperreflective band on OCT. A standardized protocol was developed to correlate OCT images and histopathological findings by generating serial cross-sections of the retina, which can be used to better understand otherwise ambiguous OCT findings.

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy increase the risk of developing neovascular age-related macular degeneration in later life.,"To study the relationship between mean platelet volume (MPV) and central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in hypertensive patients. Hospital-based, retrospective, case control design. The sample group consisted of 100 patients with a known history of hypertension and who are diagnosed with CRVO. The control group consisted of 100 age and sex-matched patients with the sample group and who had a sole history of hypertension without any other systemic diseases and the best corrected visual acuity of 20/20 in both the eyes. CRVO was diagnosed based on clinical examination. All cases and control subjects underwent complete ocular examination. MPV, platelet count, hemoglobin, white blood cell count and hematocrit parameters were recorded for both groups. The data of patients with CRVO was compared with the control subjects. Confidence interval was set at 95% with a P-value of < 0.05. MPV was significantly higher among hypertensive cases diagnosed with CRVO when compared with the hypertensive control group (8.059  0.016, 7.442  0.15 fL respectively; P < 0.001). The platelet count was lower in the control group, but the difference was not significant. The systolic blood pressure was significantly higher in the sample group. Our results demonstrated that MPV values were significantly higher in patients with CRVO, suggesting that increased MPV may contribute to the development of CRVO. "
Enhanced Social Dominance and Altered Neuronal Excitability in the Prefrontal Cortex of Male KCC2b Mutant Mice.,"To determine the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity and severity of disease at a large Canadian tertiary care centre, as well as to determine risk factors for disease and current treatment practices. This was a retrospective cohort study of infants admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) at McMaster Children's Hospital, who underwent screening for retinopathy of prematurity between August 2010 and August 2016. The overall incidence of retinopathy of prematurity was 67.1% (418/623 infants); severe retinopathy of prematurity was seen in 14.3% (89/623). This signified an increase compared to our previous study at the same institution, where the incidence of retinopathy of prematurity was 40.4% and severe retinopathy of prematurity was 9.2% between 2006 and 2010. Stage 1 disease showed the greatest increase, from 9.0% (38/423) to 21.0% (131/623). Our cohort had a higher proportion of infants born at 24 weeks GA or less (15.7% vs 8.7%). Predictors of retinopathy of prematurity in a multivariate regression model were gestational age (OR=0.829, p=0.002), birth weight (OR=0.712, p=0.003) and length of NICU stay (OR=0.844, p=0.00). Treatment was performed in 10.5% (44/418) of infants with retinopathy of prematurity, with infants earlier in the study period mainly receiving laser photocoagulation and infants born in more recent years receiving intravitreal bevacizumab. There has been an increase in retinopathy of prematurity incidence, both in early (stage 1) disease and in severe retinopathy of prematurity. This is partially explained by the almost doubling of the proportion of infants born at 24 weeks gestational age or less. Since mid-2013, intravitreal anti-VEGF therapy has replaced laser photocoagulation as the preferred treatment modality. This research did not receive any specific grant from funding agencies in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors. "
Characterizing variants of unknown significance in rhodopsin: a functional genomics approach.,"To assess the effect of the 45-minute diagnostic occlusion test (DOT) on the measured esodeviation in patients with acquired esotropia. After the routine ophthalmic examination, 67 patients with acquired esotropia were randomly assigned to either the patch group (37 subjects) or the control group (30 subjects). For both groups the mean distance and near deviations before and after 45 minutes were compared. The mean pre- and post-DOT measurement at distant target for the patch group was an esodeviation of 6.77.5 prism diopters (PD) and 13.211.7 PD, respectively. The 45-minute DOT induced an average increase of the esotropia of 6.45.9 PD in the patch group (p=0.0001). For the control group, the first and second mean measurement were similar, 9.27.6 PD and 9.16.5 PD, respectively (p=0.103). The mean pre- and post-DOT esodeviation at near distance for the patch group were 10.110.1 PD and 18.713.7 PD (p=0.001). Following the DOT, >5 PD change was noted in 26 (70.1%) from a near distance target (p=0.001). For the control group, the mean near first and second measurements were 13.9 PD and 15.0 PD, respectively. Performing DOT in acquired esodeviations may help to reveal the full deviation and ultimately decrease the risk of surgical undercorrection by eliminating tonic fusional divergence. The DOT can be applied clinically for acquired esotopia to accurately measure the angle of deviation. "
The use of mesenchymal stem cells for the treatment of progressive retinal diseases: a review.,"To report the long-term outcomes of the conjunctivo-rhinostomy surgery with labial mucosal graft performed for the patients of proximal lacrimal drainage system disorders. Retrospective, single surgeon (KB), non-comparative study including patients having complete obstruction of the superior and inferior proximal lacrimal drainage system. All patients underwent conjunctivo-rhinostomy with labial mucosal graft insertion. Preoperatively, tear film break-up time and a fluorescein dye disappearance test was performed for each patient. A phaco aspiration tubing segment was used for supporting the mucosal graft for first 4 weeks followed by its removal. Minimum follow-up was 12 months. fluorescein dye disappearance test and nasal endoscopy were performed at each follow-up visit. Total resolution of epiphora and negative fluorescein dye disappearance test was defined as complete success. Eighteen patients (12 males, 6 females) with a mean age of 39.94 years (range 7-76 years) all had a unilateral presentation. The indication for surgery was trauma (n=11), failed dacryocystorhinostomy (DCR) with canalicular obstruction (n=4), chronic ocular inflammation with complete punctal occlusion (n=2), and post-radiotherapy (n=1). At a mean follow-up of 5.38 years, complete success was observed in 12 (66.67%), partial success in 4 (22.22%) while in 2 (11.11%) patients, the procedure failed. Labial mucosal graft in conjunctivo-rhinostomy is a successful adjunct which provides satisfactory long-term outcomes. Our surgical technique of directly suturing the mucosal graft to surrounding muscle provides better functionality to the system with eyelid blinking. "
Evaluation of amalgam-related retinal neurotoxicity with optical coherence tomography findings.,"Orbital Rhabdomyosarcoma is a highly malignant tumor predominantly affecting children. Our study adds more understanding of this tumor to ophthalmologists from the clinicopathological, radiological and genetic aspects. A retrospective clinicopathological and radiological study of ocular rhabdomyosarcoma with genetic profiling. All the cases with confirmed tissue diagnosis of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma presenting at a tertiary eye hospital in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia during the period 1985-2015. Charts and histological slides of 26 patients were reviewed. DNA was extracted from paraffin-embedded biopsies and genotyping was performed to detect chromosomal abnormalities and Copy-number variations regions. 18 males and 8 females were included with a mean age at presentation of 6.9 years (SD of 4.4). Proptosis and globe displacement were the commonest clinical presentations. Embryonal histopathological type was the commonest (73.1%) with superior orbital involvement (p = 0.024). Using magnetic resonance imaging, the embryonal type showed higher Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value compared to the alveolar type (p = 0.98). Genetic profiling showed Copy-number gain in regions spanning PAX3, DDIT3, Gli, Wnt6 genes. DICER1 gene implication was found in 9 sporadic cases. Rhabdomyosarcoma is rare and occurs with a mean age of 7 years, predominantly among males. The commonest embryonal type is significantly correlated with superior orbital involvement. Radiologically, it shows an ADC of 0.67-0.09  10<sup>-3</sup>mm<sup>2</sup>/s. (p = 0.98). The gain in PAX3, DDIT3, Gli1, Wnt6 genes is a new finding while the DICER1 gene implication in the absence of familial hereditary carcinoma is another interesting finding. "
The value of prednisolone acetate provocative test before intravitreal triamcinolone acetonide injections.,"To determine the sensitivity of orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in acute demyelinating optic neuritis (ON) in routine clinical practice, and the added value of a dedicated neuroradiology interpretation. Retrospective chart review. Patients with clinically proven ON evaluated between 2004 and 2014 in the University of Michigan neuro-ophthalmology clinics. Inclusion criteria involved visual recovery and orbital MRI completed within 30days of symptom onset and before corticosteroid treatment. Demographics, clinical examination, and MRI report data (high T2 signal, gadolinium contrast enhancement) were abstracted for each eligible eye. Every MRI was reinterpreted by a neuroradiologist masked to the affected side. Descriptive statistics summarized patient and eye characteristics. Interrater agreement between the neuroradiologist and the radiology report for the radiographic diagnosis of ON was assessed with Cohen's kappa statistic. Of 92 patients who met all inclusion criteria, 70 (76.1%) were reported to have at least 1 MRI feature consistent with ON. After dedicated review by a neuroradiologist, 77 (83.7%) were determined to have a positive MRI for ON. Agreement between the neuroradiologist and MRI report was moderate (=0.63). Gadolinium enhancement was the most common feature in MRI positive ON (72 [78.3%] of neuroradiology reviewed MRIs; 66 [71.7%] of clinical MRI reports). The sensitivity of MRI in ON was lower than previously reported and confirms the importance of making a clinical diagnosis of ON without relying on neuroimaging for confirmation. MRI interpretation by a skilled neuroradiologist increased sensitivity, underscoring the complexity of orbital MRI interpretation. "
Rare Case of Nerve Sheath Myxoma of the Eyelid Misdiagnosed as Mucocele.,"We hypothesized that the ocular dominance associated with brain asymmetry would influence macular structure. We assessed the structural asymmetry of the macula by ocular dominance. A total of 144 patients with no ophthalmic abnormalities were examined. After classifying eyes as dominant or non-dominant using the hole-in-a-card test, the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer and the macular thickness were measured in both groups using spectral domain optical coherence tomography, and we sought associations between ocular dominance and retinal thickness. Ocular dominance was more frequently found in right eyes than in left eyes (68.75% vs 31.25%, respectively; p < 0.001). Using conditioned logistic regression, the right eye and the temporal-to-nasal retinal thickness ratio of the macular ganglion cell inner plexiform layer were selected as a final model for the determination of ocular dominance (p < 0.001, p = 0.013 respectively). Macular vertical asymmetry was associated with ocular dominance. The macular structure and ocular dominance associated with visual cortex lateralization have functional and structural relationships.

Recurrent <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> Endophthalmitis.,"Little is known about how low vision services by ophthalmologists are being provided. Here, we analyze the patterns of provision and utilization of vision rehabilitation services in Ontario, Canada. Retrospective population-based study between 2009 and 2015. Ophthalmologists (n = 92) who billed for vision rehabilitation services through the Ontario Health Insurance Plan in Ontario and the patients (n = 8949) who received these services. Billing data for low vision services (2009-2015) was received from Ontario Health Insurance Plan. Data were analyzed to describe patient demographics (age, sex, geographic distribution, number, and type of visits) and service provider information (geographic location, number of years providing services, and number of services per year). It is estimated that  5% of patients with low vision in Ontario accessed these vision rehabilitation services by ophthalmologists. The majority of these patients were females (61%) and > 60 years old (79%). While patient and provider geographic distributions overlapped in the areas with largest patient populations, many regions lacked services. The majority of patients (71%) made only one vision rehabilitation visit. Nine providers practiced low vision for 7 years, while 43 provided services for only 1 year. In 2015, the most common diagnostic service provided to low vision patients was Optical Coherence Tomography of the retina and the most common therapeutic service was intravitreal for wet age-related macular degeneration. Although low vision services increased between 2009 and 2015, there were differences in ability to access care based on age, sex, and geographic location. "
Macular Hole Formation after Intravitreal Injection of Bevacizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema.,"The primary goal is to determine if the intraocular pressure reducing effect of generic Sandoz travoprost is equivalent to that of brand-name Travatan Z. The secondary goal is to determine if generic Sandoz travoprost is as well tolerated as Travatan Z. This prospective randomized crossover trial allocated 76 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma, normotensive glaucoma, or ocular hypertension in a 1:1 ratio to start with either generic Sandoz travoprost or Travatan Z. Crossover happened after 3 weeks. The primary endpoint, intraocular pressure, was measured in both eyes at baseline, at week 3, and at week 6. The secondary endpoint was tolerability of both drugs as assessed by a questionnaire administered at week 3 and week 6. The intraocular pressure lowering effect of generic Sandoz travoprost was equivalent to that of Travatan Z (18.20  3.41 mmHg and 18.44  3.48 mmHg respectively, p < 0.0001). Tolerability, as measured with a questionnaire, was similar between the two formulations of travoprost. This study is the first to compare a brand-name travoprost with one of its generic forms and adds to the body of evidence that generic glaucoma eye drops are as effective and well-tolerated as their brand name counterparts. The intraocular pressure lowering effect of generic Sandoz travoprost is equivalent to that of Travatan Z. Patient tolerance of generic and brand-name travoprost is similar. "
Effect of High Myopia on Optic Nerve Head by Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy in Nepalese Eyes.,"To identify factors associated with secondary surgical intervention after glaucoma filtration surgery. Population-based retrospective cohort. Patient records with billing claims for a primary glaucoma filtration surgery occurring between April 2003 and March 2015 were identified. Each identified record was examined for instances of secondary glaucoma surgeries within the patient's first postoperative year. Baseline characteristics of patients who required secondary surgical intervention were compared with those who did not. A multivariable Cox proportional hazards model was used to calculate hazard ratios. Within a cohort of 10,097 patients, 349 (3.46%) underwent a secondary surgical intervention within the first postoperative year. Interventions were less frequent after surgeries that included an indwelling drainage device (HR=0.58 95% CI, 0.37-0.89), phacoemulsification (HR=0.33, 0.21-0.52), or both (HR=0.09, 0.03-0.31). Patients with preoperative aminoglycoside and mydriatic exposure had significantly increased risk of secondary surgical intervention (HR=3.19, 1.89-5.36) and (HR=2.32, 1.49-3.61). Patients who underwent surgery on their contralateral eye experienced secondary surgical interventions more frequently: 7.44 per 10,000 person-days (versus 1.18 per 10,000 person-days, p < 0.0001). No significant differences in the rates of secondary surgical intervention were observed for patients taking different classes of glaucoma medications or those exposed to higher amounts of benzalkonium chloride. In Ontario, the overall rates of secondary surgical interventions in the first postoperative year are low but significantly higher in certain patient populations. Further work is required to address the higher rate of secondary surgical intervention in patients with a history of certain perioperative eye drop medications and those who require sequential-bilateral procedures.

Development of Optic Disc Torsion in Children.,"There are currently low rates of screening for diabetic retinopathy (DR) and sight-threatening diabetic macular edema (DME) in Ontario. To present results of the Toronto Tele-Retinal screening program for patients with diabetes mellitus and to evaluate thebenefit of optical coherence tomography (OCT) in combination with monoscopic colour fundus photographs for detection of DME. All electronic medical records for adults with type I and II diabetes mellitus screened through the Toronto Tele-Retinal screening program between September 2013 to August 2017 across 7 sc~reening sites in urban and rural settings were reviewed. Monoscopic colour fundus photographs were graded for presence or absence of DR and DME alone and in combination with OCT scans. A total of 775 patient screens, consisting of 566 first-time screens and 209 re-screens were completed over the 48-month study period. Approximately 37% of all patients with a mean disease duration of 7years had never had an eye examination. Across the sample, 27% of patients had DR, with majority graded to have mild DR, whereas DME was detected in 5% of patients in at least 1 eye. Of all DME detected in the Toronto Tele-Retinal screening program, 38% required the use of adjunct OCT. Other pathologies, including age-related macular degeneration (19%) and glaucomatous or optic nerve findings (8%), were also identified. Tele-retinal screening programs may circumvent low rates of DR screening for patients with diabetes mellitus and increase the rate of detection of DME with monoscopic colour fundus photographs and adjunct OCT. "
Measurement of Contrast Sensitivity in Patients with Behet's Disease without Ocular Involvement.,"To assess the impact of presenting visual impairment (PVI) on the utilization of formal home care services in Canada. Formal home care services were defined as services provided by professionals. Presenting visual impairment was self-reported impaired vision. Cross-sectional survey. Respondents to the Canadian Community Health Survey - Healthy Aging 2008/2009 (n = 30 865). Self-reported utilization of formal home care services were compared by PVI status and sociodemographic groups. Overall, 23.9% of Canadians aged 45+ years with PVI utilized home care services versus 4.8% of those without (p < 0.0001). Canadians aged 65+ years (11.5%) used home care services more frequently than those aged 45-64 years (2.3%; p < 0.001). Among Canadians aged 65+ years, Caucasians (11.8%) were more frequent users than non-Caucasians (2.9%; p = 0.0002). Among Caucasians aged 65+ years, higher levels of utilization were documented in seniors with PVI (32.3%) versus those without (11.0%; p < 0.0001), females (14.5%) versus males (8.5%; p < 0.0001), seniors without a partner (18.6%) versus those with a partner (7.9%; p < 0.001), and seniors with incomes under the 20th percentile (14.7%) versus their peers with incomes 20th percentile (9.8%; p < 0.0001). Seniors with PVI were 30% more likely than those without to utilize home care services after adjusting for confounding effects (prevalence ratio = 1.3, 95% CI 1.1-2.5). Among nonusers of home care services, unmet needs for home care services were reported by 10.0% of Caucasian seniors with PVI versus 3.1% of those without PVI (p < 0.0001). Canadians with visual impairment are more likely to utilize formal home care services compared to those without. "
Short-term Efficacy and Safety of Ranibizumab for Neovascular Age-related Macular Degeneration in the Real World: A Post-marketing Surveillance Study.,"To report the clinical outcome of Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in cases of corneal decompensation secondary to iridocorneal endothelial syndrome (ICE) or posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy (PPCD). Retrospective interventional case series. Eight eyes of 7 patients that underwent DMEK due to corneal decompensation secondary to either ICE syndrome or PPCD, and had at least 6 months of postoperative follow-up. Data were collected on best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), graft attachment and survival, endothelial cell density (ECD), and intraocular pressure (IOP). BCVA change, ECD loss, and IOP elevations were analyzed. Patients' age was 51.5  13.3years. Four eyes (4 patients) had ICE syndrome and 4 eyes (3 patients) had PPCD. All procedures were uneventful. Follow-up time was 11.3  7.6 months (range 6-24 months). DMEK was combined with goniosynechiolysis in 3 eyes and iridoplasty in 1 eye. BCVA improved in all eyes. Mean BCVA improved from 0.70  0.34 logMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/100; range 20/50-20/400) preoperatively to 0.21  0.14 logMAR (Snellen equivalent 20/34; range 20/20-20/40) at the final follow-up (p=0.008). Donor ECD was 2740  193 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> preoperatively and 1967  277 cells/mm<sup>2</sup> at 6 months after surgery (p=0.010)-cell loss rate of 27.8%. There were no graft rejections and no graft failures. Postoperative IOP rise (steroid response) was seen in 2 eyes, and was managed successfully with topical medical treatment. There was no evidence of glaucoma progression in any of the cases. DMEK surgery was effective in treating corneal decompensation secondary to ICE syndrome and PPCD. Adjunct procedures can be simultaneously combined with DMEK to address other disease aspects. "
Epiretinal Proliferation Associated with Lamellar Hole or Macular Hole: Origin and Surgical Prognosis.,"To summarize and quantitatively evaluate sleep outcomes of dry eye disease (DED) patients. A systematic review and meta-analysis. DED patients were individuals with dry eye symptoms or primary Sjogren's syndrome (pSS). Controls were healthy, non-pSS, or non-DED patients. A systematic search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and grey literature was conducted. Studies were screened using Covidence software. Outcomes included sleep quality, duration, daytime sleepiness, prevalence/incidence/severity of sleep disorders, and sleep disturbances. Meta-analysis was conducted using STATA 13.0. The weighted mean difference (WMD) was calculated as the effect size for continuous scale outcomes. Random-effects models were developed based on the presence of heterogeneity. Seventeen full-text articles (16370 subjects) and 2 conference abstracts (571763 subjects) were included. Compared to controls, DED patients score higher on the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (WMD = 1.69, 95% CI: 0.82, 2.56; I<sup>2</sup> = 88.8%, p < 0.001) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (WMD = 2.26, 95% CI: 0.96, 3.56; I<sup>2</sup> = 82.4%, p < 0.001). Additionally, DED patients spend less time asleep (WMD = -0.59 hours, 95% CI: -0.94, -0.24; I<sup>2</sup> = 85.1%, p < 0.001), experience more sleep disturbances, and may have increased prevalence, incidence, severity of sleep disorders. DED patients may have poorer sleep quality, greater daytime sleepiness, less sleep, more sleep disturbances, increased prevalence, incidence, and severity of sleep disorders compared to non-DED patients. Further research is needed to identify potential causes of these outcomes given the paucity and heterogeneity of included studies. It may be worthwhile to consider sleep in the clinical management of DED. "
Outcome of External Dacryocystorhinostomy and Monocanalicular Intubation in Patients with Total Obstruction of One Canalicus.,"To evaluate the effects of Behet's syndrome (BS) on tear osmolarity and tear film function tests. Thirty patients with BS and 41 control subjects were enrolled in this study. Tear osmolarity was measured with an osmometer. Tear film function tests involved corneal fluorescein staining, tear film breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer's 1 test, and an Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) Questionnaire. The patients with BS had significantly higher tear osmolarity (p = 0.000) and OSDI scores (p = 0.000) than the healthy controls. The TBUT (p = 0.000) and Schirmer's 1 test (p = 0.033) results were significantly lower in the BS group, but the fluorescein staining results were not statistically different. A significant correlation was found between tear osmolarity, OSDI, and the activity of BS. BS is associated with hyperosmolarity of the tear film, which can damage the ocular surface and affect tear functions. "
Comparison of Blue and Green Confocal Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscope Imaging to Detect Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Defects.,"Several Canadian health authorities have defunded preoperative cataract history and physical examinations performed by general practitioners. While these authorities suggest that such decisions are evidence-based, we are unaware of reviews addressing this topic, nor have health authorities been forthcoming with evidence used in their decision-making processes. The objective of this study is to perform a comprehensive review of the literature regarding the value of preoperative histories and physical examinations in cataract surgery. Systematic review. The following databases were searched: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, Google Scholar, Web of Science, EMBASE, CINAHL, and BIOSIS Previews. Only higher-level forms of evidence were assessed, including randomized controlled trials, cohort, and case-control studies. Two reviewers independently assessed titles and abstracts for concordance with inclusion criteria. Disagreements between authors were resolved by discussion. We identified 3 articles that met our inclusion criteria: two prospective and one retrospective cohort studies. These articles suggest traditional preoperative histories and physical examinations could be replaced by a health questionnaire (Jastrzebski et al. and Reeves et al.) or eliminated altogether (Alboim et al.). Scientific literature presently contains 3 studies suggesting that preoperative histories and physical examinations could be modified or eliminated. However, methodological weaknesses and data analysis derived from these studies suggests defunding preoperative medical examination may be premature. While finding efficiencies in medical care is admirable, physicians should be cautious in accepting recommendations that reduce checks ensuring perioperative safety. Further studies of better methodological quality should be completed to clarify the present evidence. "
Switching to Aflibercept in Diabetic Macular Edema after Unsatisfactory Response to Other Anti-vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Drugs.,"This study aims to quantify the proportion of ophthalmology patients using information technology for finding information on their eye condition(s). A survey method study design was used to collect information for this study. Over the course of 4 months, 206 consecutive patients in oculoplastics, oncology, and retina subspecialty ophthalmology clinics were surveyed. A 14-question survey instrument was developed for the purposes of this study, focusing on 3 main domains of technology use: mobile phones, computers, and software used on either of those devices. When the entire group was analyzed, 85% stated they own a cell phone, 87% own and use a computer, and 47% reported using the internet to search for information on their eye condition. Significant differences based on patient age emerged when assessing whether patients used the internet to search for information on eye condition(s). The majority of patients younger than 60years reported having searched the internet for information (67%), whereas only 29% of patients older than 60years reported the same thing. Similar differences in the age groups also arose for other variables. Overall, the majority of ophthalmology patients do not search the internet for information on eye conditions. However, when stratified into separate age groups (less than and greater than age 60 years), the majority of younger patients search the internet for information on their eye condition(s), whereas the majority of older patients do not. As a result, one can conclude that age is a significant predictive factor in the use of internet technologies for information regarding eye conditions. "
Comparison of Laser In Situ Keratomileusis Flap Morphology and Predictability by WaveLight FS200 Femtosecond Laser and Moria Microkeratome: An Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography Study.,"To characterize changes in body positioning while performing a standardized slit lamp examination after exposure to an educational module on ergonomics. Prospective interventional pilot study. Ten ophthalmology residents. An educational module discussing ergonomic issues in ophthalmology was created. In a standardized examination lane, participants were recorded performing 3 trials of an indirect slit lamp examination of a volunteer patient, adjusting equipment as they saw fit. Participants were then sent the module and within 2 weeks repeated the trial process. Data were processed using biomechanical software to obtain the Rapid Upper Limb Assessment (RULA) injury risk score, elbow and shoulder joint reaction moments, neck and trunk flexion angles, and spinal curvature magnitudes. The RULA injury risk scores decreased after completion of the module (95% CI 2.10-2.77), indicating a lesser risk for injury to the resident. Shoulder flexion and elbow abduction moments also decreased (95% CI -3.2 to -1.5 and -0.44 to -0.04, respectively), suggesting a more neutral body posture. The trunk flexion angle increased after completion of the module (95% CI -5.1 to -1.6), signifying a more upright trunk posture; this was confirmed by the lumbar spine curvature, which flattened postmodule (95% CI 6.6-940). These results suggest a promising ability for an educational module to mitigate some injury risk in this population during indirect slit lamp examination. It also delineated some awkward postures that persisted despite the module. These results will be reintegrated into the module to optimize its educational utility. "
Clinical Efficacy of Custom-built Software for the Early Detection of Glaucoma: A Comparison of Axial-length and Major Retinal Artery Location Data.,"The Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada has mandated a shift in post-graduate residency education in Canada towards a competency-based model. Within this context, it is unclear how resident's competence in cataract surgery is currently being assessed for both formative and summative purposes. Therefore, we conducted a national survey to evaluate the current landscape of cataract surgery teaching in Canadian Ophthalmology programs. The opportunity to participate in an online survey was extended to all Canadian ophthalmology program directors and residents. Between July and September 2017, data was collected on demographics (name of program, levels of training), current framework of assessment, and any other contexts for cataract surgery assessments being used (e.g., wetlabs or surgical simulators). We had a total of 32 responses including 7 program directors (22%), 14 senior residents (44%), and 10 junior residents (34%). The assessments used varied greatly; none of the residency programs used a published assessment tool for assessing skill in cataract surgery. The majority of programs (9 of 11; 82%) used locally-designed assessments and two programs (18%) did not use any standardized forms or tools. All schools were using a wet lab to augment surgical teaching and simulators were being used by 5 of 11 programs (45%). There are a variety of approaches being used to assess competence in cataract surgery. Many programs share some similarities, and a framework for designing assessment is suggested to guide future efforts at competency-based training and assessment. "
The localization of a conjunctivoscleral foreign body via high-resolution microscopy coil magnetic resonance imaging in a dog.,"Clerkship at the University of British Columbia (UBC) Medical School encompasses a variety of models: traditional rotation-based clerkship; distributed rotation-based clerkship at sites across the province; and a longitudinal integrated community clerkship. The purpose of this study was to: (i) Evaluate the undergraduate ophthalmology clerkship experience at UBC to compare outcomes and experiences across the various sites and models; and (ii) Apply educational theories to evaluation outcomes in order to improve curriculum design for clerkship programs. Cross-sectional evaluation of the ophthalmology clerkship program at UBC. Using a logic model, we identified inputs, activities, and outputs of the ophthalmology clerkship experience at each site at UBC. Site directors and administrators were contacted for information regarding program curriculum and delivery, and outcomes were described using written exam and clinical assessment scores as well as student and instructor feedback (questionnaires with narrative responses). Site directors and administrators from all clerkship sites participated in the study. Clerkship experiences across all sites (rotation-based and integrated community clerkship) were found to be unique in contexts and clinical activities. There were no significant differences noted between outcomes in the rotation-based sites. Clerkship experiences can be delivered in various contexts and through varied clinical settings, yet provide an equivalent student learning experience. As longitudinal and distributed clerkship models gain traction in medical education around the world, there are lessons for undergraduate medical education both in ophthalmology and in other areas.

Genetic testing in patients with retinitis pigmentosa: features of unsolved cases.,"Given the lack of policy standardization in Canada, this systematic review investigates the optimal duration of preoperative fasting in cataract surgery. A literature search was conducted on Ovid MEDLINE, with potential articles screened by 2 independent authors. The primary endpoint was the incidence of aspiration. Overall, 231 articles were screened, of which 6 were eligible. Two studies found no cases of aspiration in over 35 000 patients who underwent cataract surgery without preoperative fasting, some with intravenous sedation (50% in 1 series, less than 1% in the second). A survey of the British Ophthalmic Anaesthesia Society found that over 50% of centres did not require fasting before cataract surgery. Only 1 included report discussed a case of aspiration pneumonitis following cataract surgery with general anaesthesia and 14hours of preoperative fasting. In closing, further evidence is needed to delineate the risk of pulmonary aspiration based on fasting time in cataract surgery. "
Blindness and acute pancreatitis: Purtscher-like retinopathy.,"The purpose of this study was to perform a systematic review of the current literature on simulator-based training in vitreoretinal surgery (VRS). We examined the results regarding simulated VRS and provided an overview of how the current results may be employed in VRS training. Lastly, we evaluated the quality of these results. The databases of Pubmed, Embase and Cochrane Library were searched for articles in English involving simulated VRS training. A qualitative analysis was performed, since the studies which met our inclusion criteria did not allow for a quantitative meta-analysis. We identified 203 articles of which seven met the inclusion criteria. Of these, six studies investigated simulation with EyeSi Surgical (VRMagic, Mannheim, Germany). Six studies reported positive performance curves. Four studies showed construct validity. One study attempted to show skill transfer from simulator to vitrectomies performed on cadavers. Methodological quality of the included studies was moderate but lacking in instrument validation. Simulator-based training in VRS can assess and possibly assist acquisition of a variety of VRS skills. Further research is needed to support transfer from simulator to operating room. Future studies should strive to follow established validation frameworks and streamline study designs. "
Objective assessment of intraoperative technical skill in capsulorhexis using videos of cataract surgery.,"We previously reported autophagic structures in rod photoreceptors expressing a misfolding RHO (rhodopsin) mutant (RHO<sup>P23H</sup>), suggesting that autophagy may play a role in degrading the mutant RHO and/or be involved in photoreceptor cell death. To further examine autophagy in normal and diseased rods, we generated transgenic Xenopus laevis tadpoles expressing the dually fluorescent autophagy marker mRFP-eGFP-LC3 in rods, which changes from green to yellow and finally red as autophagic structures develop and mature. Using transgenic lines with constitutive and inducible expression, we determined the time-course of autophagy in rod photoreceptors: autophagosomes last for 6 to 8hours before fusing with lysosomes, and acidified autolysosomes last for about 28hours before being degraded. Autophagy was diurnally regulated in normal rods, with more autophagic structures generated during periods of light, and this regulation was non-circadian. We also found that more autophagosomes were produced in rods expressing the misfolding RHO<sup>P23H</sup> mutant. The RHO chromophore absorbs photons to initiate phototransduction, and is consumed in this process; it also promotes RHO folding. To determine whether increased autophagy in light-exposed normal rods is caused by increased RHO misfolding or phototransduction, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock out the RPE65 and GNAT1 genes, which are essential for chromophore biosynthesis and phototransduction respectively. Both knockouts suppressed light-induced autophagy, indicating that although light and misfolded rhodopsin can both induce autophagy in rods, light-induced autophagy is not due to misfolding of RHO, but rather due to phototransduction.

Multimodal imaging including optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with type B Niemann-Pick disease.,"The aim of this study was to evaluate thiol/disulfide homeostasis and ischemia-modified albumin levels with primary open-angle glaucoma, ocular hypertension, and control group; also to interpret the correlation between these biochemical parameters and retinal nerve fiber layer analysis. In a prospective cross-sectional study, 30 primary open-angle glaucoma cases, 30 ocular hypertension cases, and 30 control subjects were included in the study. Native thiol, total thiol, and disulfide measurements and disulfide/native thiol, disulfide/total thiol, and native thiol/total thiol ratios were evaluated as thiol-disulfide homeostasis. Albumin and ischemia-modified albumin parameters were also evaluated. All cases underwent detailed ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity, retinal nerve fiber layer via optical coherence tomography, intraocular pressure, and central corneal thickness measurements and visual field analysis by 24-2 Swedish Interactive Threshold Algorithm (SITA) Standard visual field test. Primary open-angle glaucoma group had significantly higher ischemia-modified albumin values than ocular hypertension and control group (p<0.001). Native thiol and total thiol values of control group were statistically higher than those of primary open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension groups. The correlation between the temporal retinal nerve fiber layer value and ischemia-modified albumin, disulfide/native thiol, and disulfide/total thiol values of the primary open-angle glaucoma patients included in the study was moderate correlation in negative direction (r=-0.46, r=-0.39, r=-0.39, respectively), whereas there was a statistically significant moderate correlation in positive direction between the native thiol/total thiol values (r=0.39) (p<0.05). These findings have reinforced the role of oxidative stress in the etiopathogenesis of primary open-angle glaucoma, suggesting that the thinning retinal nerve fiber layer may be associated with oxidative stress in favor of prooxidant shift.

Mechanisms of neurodegeneration in a preclinical autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa knock-in model with a Rho<sup>D190N</sup> mutation.,"To investigate the potential correlation between complement factor B polymorphisms and age-related macular degeneration. We retrieved relevant articles systematically by searching PubMed and Web of Science databases. The pooled odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for five complement factor B polymorphism rs641153, rs4151667, rs1048709, rs2072633, and rs12614 using data from included articles in both random effects and fixed effect models. Subgroup meta-analysis based on age-related macular degeneration type, choroidal neovascular disease (rs641153 and rs4151667), geographic atrophy (rs641153 and rs4151667), and races was also performed. In the overall comparison, we observed that the distribution of rs641153 and the risk of age-related macular degeneration were significantly correlated (p<0.00001). Similar results were obtained in subgroup analysis based on race (Caucasians, p<0.00001; Asians, p=0.003) and age-related macular degeneration type (choroidal neovascular disease, p<0.00001; geographic atrophy, p=0.04). As for complement factor B rs4151667, the genotypic effects were also demonstrated statistically significant in overall analysis (p<0.00001) and only in Caucasians diagnosed with choroidal neovascular disease (p=0.004), but not in Asians. Moreover, no statistically significant correlations between the complement factor B polymorphisms rs1048709 (p=0.63), rs2072633 (p=0.72), rs12614 (p=0.98) and susceptibility to age-related macular degeneration were detected in either overall or subgroup analysis. Collectively, we demonstrated that the complement factor B genes rs641153 and rs4151667, but not rs1048709, rs2072633, rs12614, were associated with the susceptibility of age-related macular degeneration and might play predictive roles in future age-related macular degeneration diagnosis. More studies are needed to verify these findings. "
Spontaneous resolution of myopic retinoschisis.,"Primary objective was to assess associations between annual surgeon case volume and visual acuity outcomes following cataract surgery. Secondary objectives included (i) assessing for associations between other case and patient characteristics and post-operative visual acuity outcomes and (ii) assessing for associations between annual surgeon case volume and complication rates. Database study. All adult eyes that underwent small-incision or phacoemulsification cataract surgery with intraocular lens placement at the Aravind Eye Hospital in Madurai, India during calendar year 2015. Descriptive statistics were used to characterize the study population. Uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA) at follow-up was assessed relative to annual surgeon case volume and other case/demographic factors using bivariate linear regression with random effects modeling. Factors with p-value < 0.20 on bivariate regression were included in multivariate linear regression with random effects modeling. Post-operative UCVA following cataract surgery. Of a total of 91,084 surgeries, 35,880 eyes were included in this study. Cases were performed by 69 surgeons, who varied in annual case volume from 76 to 2900 cases during the study period. Increasing annual surgeon case volume was independently associated with a statistically significant but clinically modest improvement in UCVA in phacoemulsification cataract extraction (PECE) but not in small-incision cataract surgery (SICS). This association was most pronounced when comparing surgeons with case volumes of 350 PECE/year or fewer; surgeons with greater volume than this had results largely similar to one another. Similarly, increased annual case volume was associated with significantly lower complication rates, both in PECE and SICS. Lower patient age was independently associated with improved visual acuity outcomes and lower complication rates in both PECE and SICS. Greater surgeon experience was associated with lower complication rates in PECE but not SICS, and there was no significant association with visual acuity outcomes. High-volume cataract surgeons had improved visual acuity outcomes in PECE and lower complication rates in PECE and SICS. These findings further support the benefit of high-output ophthalmology clinics wherein individual surgeons can perform a high number of cataract extractions annually, particularly in developing nations where there is a large backlog of untreated cataract and the cataract-to-surgeon ratio is high.

Isolated rod dysfunction associated with a novel genotype of <i>CNGB1</i>.,"To examine the impacts of socio-economic status (SES) on visual impairment (VI), and the mediating role of lifestyles in developed rural areas of China. A cross-sectional study was conducted among people living in rural districts of Tianjin, a developed municipality in China. An interviewer-administered survey along with free eye screenings was conducted with participants. The questionnaire included questions about demographic characteristics, SES, medical histories and lifestyles. Presenting visual acuity (PVA) and main causes of VI were identified by ophthalmologists. 2 test was undertaken to determine whether significant differences (p<0.05) exist between VI and demographic, SES, medical history and lifestyle factors. A stepwise regression method was conducted to investigate whether lifestyles play mediating roles between SES and VI. Multivariable logistic and ordinal logistic regression were used contingent on different types of dependent variables in each regression, and adjusted odds ratio (OR) values were estimated. Of the 12,233 participants, 6,233 were male (50.59%); the mean age was 34.61 years; 310 (2.54%) had VI. Hypertension, diabetes and cardiopathy were main medical histories, with 1,640 had hypertension (13.41%), 854 had diabetes (6.98%) and 483 had cardiopathy (3.95%). About SES factors, higher education level (Adjusted OR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.75-0.95) and higher income level (Adjusted OR, 0.54; 95% CI, 0.39-0.76), were significantly associated with VI in a gradient across severity of VI. Lifestyles including smoking (Adjusted OR, 1.55; 95% CI, 1.31-1.83) and drinking (Adjusted OR, 1.36; 95% CI, 1.06-1.74) played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the full sample. Besides smoking and drinking, reading every week (Adjusted OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.53-2.82) and exercising more than 2h every day (Adjusted OR, 0.39; 95% CI, 0.15-1.00) also played mediating roles between SES and VI when considering the subsample (age16). This study revealed the crucial impacts of SES factors on VI, and the mediating role played by several lifestyles. Targeted public health interventions for reducing VI should thus be proposed in developed rural areas of China. "
CD140b (PDGFR) signaling in adipose-derived stem cells mediates angiogenic behavior of retinal endothelial cells.,"Because more patients are presenting with self-guided research of symptoms, it is important to assess the capabilities and limitations of these available health information tools. To determine the accuracy of the most popular online symptom checker for ophthalmic diagnoses. In a cross-sectional study, 42 validated clinical vignettes of ophthalmic symptoms were generated and distilled to their core presenting symptoms. Cases were entered into WebMD symptom checker by both medically trained and nonmedically trained personnel blinded to the diagnosis. Output from the symptom checker, including the number of symptoms, ranking and list of diagnoses, and triage urgency were recorded. The study was conducted on October 13, 2017. Analysis was performed between October 15, 2017, and April 30, 2018. Accuracy of the top 3 diagnoses generated by the online symptom checker. The mean (SD) number of symptoms entered was 3.6 (1.6) (range, 1-8). The median (SD) number of diagnoses generated by the symptom checker was 26.8(21.8) (range, 1-99). The primary diagnosis by the symptom checker was correct in 11 of 42 (26%; 95% CI, 12%-40%) cases. The correct diagnosis was included in the online symptom checker's top 3 diagnoses in 16 of 42 (38%; 95% CI, 25%-56%) cases. The correct diagnosis was not included in the symptom checker's list in 18 of 42 (43%; 95% CI, 32%-63%) cases. Triage urgency based on the top diagnosis was appropriate in 7 of 18 (39%; 95% CI, 14%-64%) emergent cases and 21 of 24 (88%; 95% CI, 73%-100%) nonemergent cases. Interuser variability for the correct diagnosis being in the top 3 listed was at least moderate (Cohen =0.74; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95). The most popular online symptom checker may arrive at the correct clinical diagnosis for ophthalmic conditions, but a substantial proportion of diagnoses may not be captured. These findings suggest that further research to reflect the real-life application of internet diagnostic resources is required. "
Primary Intra-Arterial Chemotherapy for Retinoblastoma in the Intravitreal Chemotherapy Era: Five Years of Experience.,"Threshold of retinal nonperfusion for the development of proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) is unclear. To identify a threshold of retinal nonperfusion for the presence of retinal neovascularization and the distribution and area of retinal nonperfusion in eyes with severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), PDR, neovascularization of the optic disc (NVD), and retinal neovascularization elsewhere (NVE). This cross-sectional image analysis study was performed between September 24, 2018, and October 24, 2018, at a multicenter national study in the United Kingdom. Baseline images were obtained from 2 completed randomized clinical trials (Ranibizumab for Diabetic Macular Edema Panretinal Photocoagulation [RDP] study and Clinical Efficacy of Intravitreal Aflibercept vs Panretinal Photocoagulation for Best Corrected Visual Acuity in Patients With Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy at 52 Weeks [CLARITY] study). The RDP study recruited eyes with severe NPDR between April 1, 2014, and December 31, 2015, and the CLARITY study recruited eyes with PDR between August 22, 2014, and November 20, 2015. Ultra-widefield angiography images of eyes with no prior panretinal photocoagulation treatment were included. The total area of retinal nonperfusion, the area of posterior pole retinal nonperfusion, and the area of peripheral retinal nonperfusion were measured. A total of 92 patients (92 eyes) were included in the study: 59 in the PDR group (mean [SD] age, 42 [15] years; 20 female [33.9%]) and 33 in the NPDR group (mean [SD] age, 63 [10] years; 30 female [9.1%]). Forty eyes had NVE and 19 had NVD with or without NVE. We identified a retinal nonperfusion threshold of 118.3 disc areas (DA) with a specificity of 84.9% (95% CI, 68.1% to 94.9%) for PDR. The median area of retinal nonperfusion was 67.8 DA (95% CI, 44.2 to 107.3 DA) in the NPDR eyes and 147.9 DA (95% CI, 127.4 to 173.5 DA) for eyes with proliferative changes, with a difference of 69.0 DA (95% CI, 42.2 to 97.7 DA; P<.001). No difference was found in the median area of posterior nonperfusion between NPDR and PDR, with a difference of 0 DA (95% CI, -6.7 to 5.2 DA; P=.56). As for peripheral nonperfusion, NPDR eyes measured 64.1 DA and PDR eyes measured 130.6 DA, with a difference of 70.8 DA (95% CI, 48.4 to 94.9 DA; P<.001). Eyes with NVD had the largest total area of retinal nonperfusion, with a difference of 65.1 DA (95% CI, 28.6 to 95.8 DA; P<.001) compared with eyes with only NVE. These findings suggest eyes with at least 107.3 DA of nonperfusion are at risk of proliferative disease, and eyes with NVD have the largest area of retinal nonperfusion. "
Metastatic Cutaneous Melanoma Presenting with Choroidal Metastasis Simulating Primary Uveal Melanoma.,"Systemic blood flow alterations have been described using video nailfold capillaroscopy (NFC) in high-tension glaucoma (HTG) and normal-tension glaucoma (NTG) variants of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG). To date, no previous studies have explored alterations in nailfold capillary blood flow in exfoliation glaucoma (XFG). To investigate the measure of peripheral blood flow as a surrogate marker of systemic vascular involvement in patients with XFG, HTG, and NTG, as well as in individuals serving as controls, using NFC. A cross-sectional clinic-based study at the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai was conducted from July 6, 2017, to May 18, 2018. A total of 111 participants (30 XFG, 30 NTG, 30 HTG, and 21 controls) received a comprehensive ophthalmic examination to confirm eligibility. Exclusion criteria were the presence of connective tissue disease, uncontrolled diabetes, history of bleeding disorders, and/or history of trauma or surgery to the nondominant hand. Resting capillary blood flow at the nailfold of the fourth digit of the nondominant hand in patients with NTG, HTG, XFG, and controls, using NFC. Two participants were excluded owing to poor nailfold image quality, resulting in 109 participants. Sixty-two participants (57%) were women and 79 (72%) were white. Mean (SD) age of the participants was 67.9 (11.7) years. Mean (SD) resting peripheral capillary blood flow at the nailfold for controls was 70.9 (52.4) picoliters/s (pL/s); HTG, 47.5 (41.9) pL/s; NTG, 40.1 (16.6) pL/s; and XFG, 30.6 (20.0) pL/s. Multivariable analysis of the differences of flow in HTG vs control participants showed values of -18.97 (95% CI, -39.22 to 1.27; P=.07) pL/s, NTG vs controls of -25.17 (95% CI, -45.92 to -4.41; P=.02) pL/s, and XFG vs controls of -28.99 (95% CI, -51.35 to -6.63; P=.01) pL/s. Decreased resting peripheral capillary blood flow may occur in patients with XFG and NTG compared with individuals without glaucoma. These findings may contribute to understanding the possible systemic nature of glaucoma. "
Atypical Case of Rosai-Dorfman Disease of the Lacrimal Gland with Adjacent Bone Erosion.,"The use of indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is a criterion standard for diagnosing polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV), an endemic and common cause of vision loss in Asian and African individuals that also presents in white individuals. However, the use of ICGA is expensive, invasive, and not always available at clinical centers. Therefore, knowing the value of certain features detected using fundus photography (FP), optical coherence tomography (OCT), and fluorescein angiography (FA) to diagnose PCV without ICGA could assist ophthalmologists to identify PCV when ICGA is not readily available. To explore the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive accuracy of potential diagnostic features detected using FP, OCT, and FA in diagnosing PCV without ICGA. Deidentified images of FP alone, OCT alone, and FA alone were graded by 3 retina specialists masked to ICGA findings for potentially diagnostic features of PCV prespecified before grading compared with the criterion standard grading of 2 other retina specialists with access simultaneously to FP, OCT, FA and ICGA. Specialists graded images of 124 eyes of 120 patients presenting between January 1, 2013, and December 31, 2016, with newly identified serous or serosanguinous maculopathy who had undergone FP, OCT, FA, and ICGA before treatment at a large referral eye center in Thailand. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and predictive accuracy from the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The mean (SD) age of the patients was 57.7 (12.6) years, 52 were women, 68 were men, and the diagnosis (from ICGA) was PCV for 65 eyes (52.4%), central serous chorioretinopathy for 45 eyes (36.3%), and typical neovascular age-related macular degeneration for 12 eyes (9.7%). With the use of FP, a potential diagnostic feature for PCV was notched or hemorrhagic pigment epithelial detachment (AUC, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85). With the use of OCT, potential diagnostic features for PCV were pigment epithelial detachment notch (AUC, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.85-0.96), sharply peaked pigment epithelial detachment (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92), and a hyperreflective ring (AUC, 0.86; 95% CI, 0.80-0.92). When at least 2 of these 4 signs were present, the AUC was 0.93 (95% CI, 0.89-0.98), with a sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.87-0.99), a specificity of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.82-0.97), a positive predictive value of 0.92 (95% CI, 0.83-0.97), and a negative predictive value of 0.95 (95% CI, 0.86-0.99). These data suggest that the potential diagnostic features detected using FP and OCT provide high sensitivity and specificity for a diagnosis of PCV, especially when at least 2 of 4 highly suggestive signs are present.

Extraskeletal Osteosarcoma: A Rare Case Arising in Phthisis Bulbi with a Review of the Literature.,"To provide a histopathologic, morphometric analysis of the retina in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Human postmortem retinas from eight patients with AD (mean age: 80  12.7 years) and from 11 age-matched controls (mean age: 78  16.57 years) were analyzed. The retinas were sampled from the superior quadrant on both the temporal and nasal sides with respect to the optic nerve. Thickness of the inner and outer layers involving the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL), retinal ganglion cell layer (RGCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) were measured and compared between controls and AD. A total of 16 measurements of retinal thickness were acquired for each layer. RNFL thinning supero-temporally was significant closest to the optic nerve (35% thickness reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-nasally, RNFL was thinner throughout all points (40% reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-temporally, RGCL thinning was pronounced toward the macula (35% thickness reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-nasally, RGCL showed uniform thinning throughout (35% reduction; P < 0.001). IPL thinning supero-temporally was statistically significant in the macula (15% reduction; P < 0.01). Supero-nasal IPL featured uniform thinning throughout (25% reduction; P < 0.001). Supero-temporally, INL and ONL thinning were pronounced toward the macula (25% reduction; P < 0.01). Supero-nasally, INL and ONL were thinner throughout (25% reduction; P < 0.01). Our study revealed marked thinning in both the inner and outer layers of the retina. These quantified histopathologic findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the retina in AD than previously reported. "
Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography of Ocular Cystinosis Confirmed by Electron Microscopy.,"AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in older individuals in the Western world, and there are currently no therapies to halt disease progression. Studies suggest that the commonly prescribed antidiabetic drug, metformin, is associated with decreased risk of several ocular diseases, but no work has investigated the effect of metformin use on development of AMD. Thus, we aim to investigate whether metformin use is associated with decreased risk of developing AMD. In this retrospective case-control study, we used medical records from patients older than 55 who have visited a University of Florida health clinic. Three controls were matched for every AMD case, defined by International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision code, based on the Charlson Comorbidity Index to ensure comparable baseline overall health status. Univariate and conditional multivariable logistic regressions were used to determine the association between a variety of covariates, including metformin use, and AMD diagnosis. Metformin use was associated with decreased odds of developing AMD, independently of the other covariates investigated, with an odds ratio of 0.58 and a 95% confidence interval of 0.43 to 0.79. Other medications assessed were not associated with decreased odds of developing AMD. Patients who had taken metformin had decreased odds of developing AMD, suggesting that metformin may have a therapeutic role in AMD development or progression in those who are at risk. Further work should include clinical trials to investigate prospectively whether metformin has a protective effect in those at risk for developing AMD. "
"Gene Expression Profiling as an Adjunctive Measure to Guide the Management of Indeterminate, High-Risk Choroidal Melanocytic Lesions: A Pilot Study.","Supramolecular hydrogels of self-assembling peptides and thermogels are very promising for biomedical applications. However, there were no thermogels of self-assembling peptides. In this study, we reported on a novel and versatile strategy to prepare thermogels of self-assembling peptides by enzyme-instructed peptide folding and self-assembly. We synthesized two phosphorylated peptides from insulin growth factor (IGF) and the second mitochondria-derived activator of caspases (Smac) (Nap-FFGGpYGSSSRRAPQT and NBD-GFFpYGAVPIAQK, respectively), which could be converted to possible hydrogelators by enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA). We found that EISA using phosphatase at 4 C resulted in peptides with a random coil conformation, which would self-assemble into worm-like micelles or very short fibers in clear solutions. At a physiological temperature of 37 C, the peptides would undergo fast transitions from random coil to -sheet- or -helix-like conformations, resulting in solution-to-gel transformations. This novel thermogel system was very useful for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture due to the biocompatibility and bioactivity of peptides. Our study provides a novel strategy to prepare a novel thermogel system for biomedical applications. "
Periocular Histiocytoid Carcinoma: Potential Diagnostic Challenges.,"To study structural chorioretinal changes in tamoxifen-treated patients. Cross-sectional case-control study comparing structural chorioretinal aspects in tamoxifen-treated patients and healthy controls. Enhanced depth spectral domain optic coherence tomography with choroidal binarization and optic coherence tomography angiography were performed. Individual retinal layer thickness and chorioretinal vascular components were compared. Subgroup analysis regarding history of chemotherapy was performed. Two hundred eyes of 100 TAM-treated patients (Group 1) and 80 eyes of 40 healthy controls (Group 2) were included. Of the 200 spectral domain optic coherence tomography scans from patients, 2 showed structural changes attributable to tamoxifen. Group 1 showed significantly lower values in choroidal parameters and in total retinal, ganglion cell layer, inner plexiform layer, outer nuclear layer, and retinal pigment epithelial thicknesses as well as an increased thickness in the outer plexiform layer. The subgroup not submitted to chemotherapy maintained significant reductions in total retinal thickness, ganglion cell layer, retinal pigment epithelium, outer nuclear layer, outer retinal layer, choroidal parameters, as well as an increased thickness in the outer plexiform layer, in comparison with Group 2. Subclinical structural retinal changes could indicate early retinal pigment epithelial and photoreceptor damage. The new finding of choroidal thinning could point toward another important pathophysiologic process in tamoxifen-induced toxicity. "
"Aggressive Ciliary Body Adenocarcinoma with Bilateral Lung Metastases: Histological, Molecular, Genetic and Clinical Aspects.","To investigate factors associated with cystoid macular edema (CME) after Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) in Asian eyes. In this retrospective, interventional, consecutive case series, 77 eyes of 65 patients who underwent DMEK were evaluated; in 53 eyes, cataract surgery was performed 1 month before DMEK (staged DMEK), and 24 eyes underwent DMEK alone (simple DMEK). Central retinal thickness, incidence of CME, postoperative best-corrected visual acuity, central corneal thickness, and corneal endothelial cell density were assessed at 1, 3, and 6 months after surgery. Multiple regression analysis and stepwise variable selection were performed for parameters such as type of surgery, iris damage scores, age, sex, axial length, preoperative visual acuity, rebubbling, air volume in the anterior chamber on postoperative day 1, history of diabetes, and endothelial cell density loss rates at 6 months after surgery. CME occurred in 12 (15.6%) of 77 eyes. There was no significant difference in best-corrected visual acuity between eyes with and without CME (P = 0.27). Multivariable analysis revealed that the difference in iris damage scores between before and after DMEK (P < 0.001), air volume in the anterior chamber (P = 0.012), simple DMEK (P = 0.020), and rebubbling (P = 0.036) were significantly associated with CME. Stepwise variable selection indicated that iris damage (P < 0.001) was the most important risk factor for CME.

Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.,"To investigate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and trinucleotide repeat (TNR) expansion in the transcription factor 4 (TCF4) gene in a large cohort of German patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). Genomic DNA was obtained from 398 patients with FECD and from 58 non-FECD controls. Thirty-seven previously reported SNPs were evaluated by genotyping. The 398 FECD samples were analyzed for TNR expansions by short tandem repeat assays and Southern blotting. The possible associations between the TNR length and clinical parameters (age, sex, visual acuity, and central corneal thickness) were analyzed in 132 patients. The SNPs in COL8A2, TCF8, LOXHD1, and AGBL1 showed no heterogeneity in 36 cases, although SLCA411 showed 3 nonsense mutations. SNPs were detected for TCF4 (rs613872, rs2123392, rs17089887, rs1452787, and rs1348047), but only rs613872 showed a significant association with FECD (P = 9.93  10). Overall, 315/398 (79%) patients harbored TNR lengths >50, whereas no non-FECD controls harbored TNR lengths >50. The TCF4 SNP rs613872 genotype was TT: 39 (67%), TG: 18 (31%), and GG: 1 (2%) in non-FECD controls; TT: 39 (47%), TG: 38 (46%), and GG: 6 (7%) in FECD cases harboring TNR <50; and TT: 23 (8%), TG: 224 (79%), and GG: 38 (13%) in FECD cases harboring TNR >50 (P = 2.93  10). No significant association was detected between the TNR length and clinical parameters. Our large German cohort demonstrated a significant association between the risk allele G in rs613872 and FECD, irrespective of TNR expansion, although this risk allele was more frequent in FECD cases with TNR expansion than without.

Steroid Induced Cataract in Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis Patient.,"To evaluate 3-year outcomes of femtosecond laser-assisted Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (F-DMEK) compared with manual Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (M-DMEK) in patients with Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD). A retrospective, interventional study, including eyes with FECD and cataract that underwent either F-DMEK or M-DMEK combined with cataract extraction at either the Toronto Western Hospital or Kensington Eye Institute, and that had at least 18 months' follow-up was conducted. complicated anterior segments, previous vitrectomy, previous keratoplasty, corneal opacity, or any other visually significant ocular comorbidity. Included were 16 eyes of 15 patients in the F-DMEK group (average follow-up 33.0  9.0 months) and 45 eyes of 40 patients in the M-DMEK group (average follow-up 32.0  7.0 months). There were no issues with the creation of femtosecond descemetorhexis (in the F-DMEK group)-all descemetorhexis cuts were complete. Best spectacle-corrected visual acuity improvement did not differ significantly between the groups at 1, 2, and 3 years (P = 0.849, P = 0.465 and P = 0.936, respectively). Rates of significant detachment in F-DMEK and M-DMEK were 1 of 16 eyes (6.25%) and 16 of 45 eyes (35.6%) (P = 0.027). Rebubbling rates were 1 of 16 eyes (6.25%) and 15 of 45 eyes (33.3%) (P = 0.047). Cell-loss rates following F-DMEK and M-DMEK were 26.8% and 36.5% at 1 year (P = 0.042), 30.5% and 42.3% at 2 years (P = 0.008), 37% and 47.5% at 3 years (P = 0.057), respectively. Graft failure rate was 0% in F-DMEK and 8.9% in M-DMEK (all were primary failures; P = 0.565). F-DMEK showed good efficacy with reduced detachment, rebubble, and cell-loss rates, compared with M-DMEK. "
Age-associated changes in human tear proteome.,"To explore the pathogenesis that TIMP-1 mediated in adult orbital xanthogranulomatous disease (AOXGD), a rare type of non-Langerhans histiocytosis that damages the appearance and quality of life of patients Methods: We reviewed 22 patients diagnosed with AOXGD based on clinical manifestations and histological analysis, and then investigated the expression of TIMP-1 and IL-6 with q-PCR and IHC in AOXGD tissues and the possible mechanism involved in the induction of TIMP-1 by IL-6. IL-6 and TIMP-1 were significantly increased in AOXGD tissues. IL-6 promoted TIMP-1 production by M1 macrophages by stimulating the phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT3. Moreover, IL-17 and IFN-, the classical markers of Th1 and Th17 cells, were increased in AOXGD. These data implied that the IL6~JAK2/STAT3-TIMP-1 signalling pathway is activated in AOXGD and that adaptive Th1 and Th17 responses are involved in the development of AOXGD. "
"Homozygous stop-gain variant in LRRC32, encoding a TGF receptor, associated with cleft palate, proliferative retinopathy, and developmental delay.","To assess the differences in cytokine levels in the aqueous humor (AH) of bilateral eyes receiving sequential phacoemulsification and intraocular lens implantation. The levels of 33 cytokines in AH samples collected from separate single-eye operations of 26 age-related cataract patients who experiencing sequential cataract surgery were compared between the first-eye and second-eye groups. The AH level of transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGF-2), an immunosuppression regulator, in the second-eye group was significantly higher than that in the first-eye group (p=0.002). No differences in the concentrations or detection rates of other cytokines were observed between the first- and second-eye groups. During bilateral sequential cataract surgery, the AH of the second eye had a higher level of TGF-2 but not of proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines compared with those in the first eye, implying a protective mechanism preventing the sympathetic immune reaction induced by the first-eye cataract surgery.

"The secreted Ly6/uPAR-related protein-1 suppresses neutrophil binding, chemotaxis, and transmigration through human umbilical vein endothelial cells.","Incomplete tear film spreading and eyelid closure can cause defective renewal of the ocular surface and air exposure-induced epithelial keratopathy (EK). In this study, we characterized the role of autophagy in mediating the ocular surface changes leading to EK. Human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs) and C57BL/6 mice were employed as EK models, respectively. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) evaluated changes in HCECs after air exposure. Each of these models was treated with either an autophagy inhibitor [chloroquine (CQ) or 3-methyladenine (3-MA)] or activator [Rapamycin (Rapa)]. Immunohistochemistry assessed autophagy-related proteins, LC3 and p62 expression levels. Western blotting confirmed the expression levels of the autophagy-related proteins [Beclin1 and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)], the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-related proteins (PERK, eIF2 and CHOP) and the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signalling pathway-related proteins. Real-time quantitative PCR (qRT-PCR) determined IL-1, IL-6 and MMP9 gene expression levels. The TUNEL assay detected apoptotic cells. TEM identified autophagic vacuoles in both EK models. Increased LC3 puncta formation and decreased p62 immunofluorescent staining and Western blotting confirmed autophagy induction. CQ treatment increased TUNEL positive staining in HCECs, while Rapa had an opposite effect. Similarly, CQ injection enhanced air exposure-induced apoptosis and inflammation in the mouse corneal epithelium, which was inhibited by Rapa treatment. Furthermore, the phosphorylation status of PERK and eIF2 and CHOP expression increased in both EK models indicating that ER stress-induced autophagy promoted cell survival. Taken together, air exposure-induced autophagy is indispensable for the maintenance of corneal epithelial physiology and cell survival. "
Contrast Agent Enhanced Multimodal Photoacoustic Microscopy and Optical Coherence Tomography for Imaging of Rabbit Choroidal and Retinal Vessels in vivo.,"High-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory autoimmune diseases. We investigated the influence and mechanisms of HMGB1 in Graves' orbitopathy (GO). HMGB1 and its receptors (receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), Toll-like receptor (TLR) 2, and TLR4 mRNA levels were evaluated by real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) in GO and non-GO orbital tissues. The mRNA expressions of HMGB1 and its receptors were evaluated in primary cultured orbital fibroblasts from six GO patients and five healthy control subjects under IL-1 or TNF- stimulation using qPCR. HMGB1 secretions under IL-1 or TNF- stimulation were evaluated by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The effects of an anti-HMGB1 antibody, RAGE antagonist (FPS-ZM1) and anti-TLR2 antibody on the expressions of IL-1 or TNF- induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated-NF-B were evaluated using ELISA and western blot analysis, respectively. The plasma levels of HMGB1 were compared among patients with active (n = 51), inactive (n = 48) GO, Graves' disease (GD) without GO (n = 30), and healthy control subjects (n = 46) by ELISA. The genes encoding HMGB1 and its receptors, as well as HMGB1 protein expression were increased in GO orbital tissues compared to non-GO tissues. IL-1 and TNF- stimulation increased the mRNA levels of HMGB1, RAGE, and TLR2 and the secretion of HMGB1 protein further in GO cells. Anti-HMGB1 antibody, FPS-ZM1 and anti-TLR2 antibody reduced IL-1- or TNF--induced production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and phosphorylated-NF-B. The plasma levels of HMGB1 were highly increased in patients with active GO, and were significantly correlated with the clinical activity score (r = 0.566, p = 0.002) and levels of thyrotropin binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (r = 0.506, p < 0.001). This study demonstrates an association of HMGB1 and its receptors in the inflammatory mechanisms of GO. HMGB1, RAGE and TLR2 blockers reduced the production of pro-inflammatory molecules, providing a rationale for blocking the HMGB1 pathway to treat patients with GO. HMGB1 proteins were secreted further in the plasma of patients with active GO, suggesting that HMGB1 can be used as a biomarker of GO activity. "
"Evaluation of intraocular pressure and retinal nerve fiber layer, retinal ganglion cell, central macular thickness, and choroidal thickness using optical coherence tomography in obese children and healthy controls.","To assess the efficacy of an endothelial keratoplasty procedure at defined intervals to 1year postoperatively for the treatment of corneal endothelial dystrophy (CED) in a canine patient. A dog diagnosed with CED with progressive corneal edema underwent an endothelial keratoplasty. The patient was examined pre- and postoperatively with slit lamp biomicroscopy and ultrasonic pachymetry. Mean central corneal thickness (CCT) measured with pachymetry was >1400m preoperatively and decreased postoperatively to 725m. The transplanted donor tissue became transparent 2weeks postoperatively and incorporated with the recipient cornea. The graft remained transparent throughout the duration of the postoperative period evaluated in this study (2weeks postoperatively to 1year). The canine patient was comfortable pre- and postoperatively. Endothelial keratoplasty is a potential therapeutic option for canine cases with progressive corneal thickening due to CED. As this is a single case study, further investigation into the use of endothelial keratoplasty to treat CED is warranted. Moreover, canine patients with CED might serve as a surgical model for human patients with Fuchs' Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy. "
"The route of the visual receptor, rhodopsin, along the cilium.","Cytomegalovirus retinitis (CMVR) may occur after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). However, little is known about its incidence, strategies for ophthalmic surveillance, and timely implementation of adequate antiviral treatment in pediatric allogeneic HSCT recipients. We provide a retrospective analysis of the epidemiology and clinical features of CMVR in pediatric allogeneic HSCT patients transplanted at our center over a 16-year period. Two patients of this cohort with leukemia are presented. Our analysis is supplemented by a systematic review on pediatric patients with leukemia and CMVR in the setting of allogeneic HSCT. The overall incidence of CMVR in our cohort was 1% (4/338) and 14.2% (3/21) in leukemic patients. In published cases, CMVR occurred at a median of 143 days after transplantation, and, in the majority of patients, was preceded by CMV detection in blood by a median of 93 days. Continued immune suppression following engraftment likely triggers CMVR. Pre-emptive treatment with ganciclovir as standard is usually successful. Foscarnet is used in case of resistance to ganciclovir or drug-induced granulocytopenia. Overall, CMVR after HSCT in pediatric leukemic patients is rare, but a potentially higher vulnerability of this population for involvement of the eye warrants a standardized ophthalmological examination plan.

Incidental bilateral naevus of Ota and naevus spilus.,"Brazil has recently integrated HIV Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) into its public health system and offered to key populations such as transgender women (TGW). This study investigates factors associated with PrEP refusal among TGW living in one of the largest and poorest cities of Brazil. We recruited 127 TGW using Respondent Driven Sampling (RDS) in Salvador, Brazil. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to define acceptability of PrEP. Two latent classes were identified: ""high acceptability of PrEP"" (91.3%) and ""PrEP refusal"" (8.7%). PrEP was less acceptable among white TGW and among those age 25 or older, with income above minimum wage (US$252.87), and reporting unprotected receptive anal intercourse with (URAI) causal partners. The findings highlight how nuanced strategies that takes into consideration unique characteristics are needed to effectively address the acceptability of PrEP. "
Posaconazole in the treatment of refractory <i>Purpureocillium lilacinum</i> (former <i>Paecilomyces lilacinus</i>) keratitis: the salvation when nothing works.,"mGluR5-containing synapses have essential roles in synaptic plasticity, circuit physiology, and learning, and dysfunction at these synapses is implicated in specific neurological disorders. As mGluR5-containing synapses are embedded in large and complex distributed circuits containing many neuron and synapse types, it is challenging to elucidate the roles of these synapses and to develop treatments for the associated disorders. Thus, it would be advantageous to deliver different genes into pre- and postsynaptic neurons connected by a mGluR5-containing synapse. Here, we develop this capability: The first gene transfer, into the presynaptic neurons, uses standard techniques to deliver a vector that expresses a synthetic peptide neurotransmitter. This peptide neurotransmitter has three domains: a dense core vesicle sorting domain, a mGluR5-binding domain composed of a single-chain variable fragment anti-mGluR5, and the His tag. Upon release, this peptide neurotransmitter binds to mGluR5, predominately located on the postsynaptic neurons. Selective gene transfer into these neurons uses antibody-mediated, targeted gene transfer and anti-His tag antibodies, as the synthetic peptide neurotransmitter contains the His tag. For the model system, we studied the connection between neurons in two neocortical areas: postrhinal and perirhinal cortices. Targeted gene transfer was over 80% specific for mGluR5-containing synapses, but untargeted gene transfer was only ~15% specific for these synapses. This technology may enable studies on the roles of mGluR5-containing neurons and synapses in circuit physiology and learning and support gene therapy treatments for specific disorders that involve dysfunction at these synapses.

Fast and robust active neuron segmentation in two-photon calcium imaging using spatiotemporal deep learning.,"To compare the retinal area measured on a panoramic en face optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) image with that on an ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF FA) image. Sixteen eyes (11 with branch retinal vein occlusion, 2 with central retinal vein occlusion, 1 with branch retinal artery occlusion, and 2 with hypertensive retinopathy) were included in this study. A panoramic en face OCTA image was created from five single non-panoramic en face OCTA 1212-mm images. The panoramic OCTA image was superimposed on the corresponding UWF FA image after image registration; the total retinal area was measured using the grid displayed on the UWF FA image. The area on the UWF FA image was measured using stereographic projection software. The area of retina measured on a single non-panoramic 1212-mm en face OCTA image, a panoramic en face OCTA image, and a UWF FA image was 152.43.4mm<sup>2</sup>, 369.626.9mm<sup>2</sup>, and 813.124.4mm<sup>2</sup>, respectively (P<0.0001). The panoramic OCTA image was 2.42-fold larger than a single non-panoramic 1212-mm OCTA image and 0.46-fold smaller than a UWF FA image. Grid-based measurements using an OCTA image superimposed on the UWF FA image enabled measurement on the panoramic en face OCTA image with minimum influence of magnification errors because of the curved surface of the retina.

[Cataract surgery in children with non-infectious uveitis: Review of current practices in France].,"The aim of this study is to evaluate visual and anatomic outcomes of 25-gauge vitrectomy with relaxing retinectomies for complex retinal detachment (RD) secondary to proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). A single-center, retrospective case series of 44 patients who had undergone a 25-gauge vitrectomy with a relaxing retinectomy for the treatment of combined RD and PVR was performed. Pre-operative characteristics, intraoperative techniques, and outcomes were analyzed. The rates of attachment, complications, and visual acuity were analyzed. Institutional Review Board/Ethics Committee approval was obtained and the described research adhered to the tenets of the Declaration of Helsinki. At the final follow-up, 27 eyes (61%) had attachment after one surgery, 41 eyes (93%) ultimately had attached retinas, 3 eyes (7%) had hypotony, 3 eyes had become phthisical (7%), and 24 eyes (56%) had improved visual acuity. After stratifying by visual outcomes, 20/400 or better BCVA was not associated with age (<i>p</i>=0.66), RD etiology (<i>p</i>=0.61), pre-operative hypotony (<i>p</i>=0.60), nor size of retinectomy (<i>p</i>=0.48). Patients achieving 20/400 vision or better were statistically more likely to be pseudophakic (<i>p</i>=0.024) and have silicone oil removal (<i>p</i><0.0001). The use of 25-gauge vitrectomy and relaxing retinectomy provides a high rate of reattachment and improved visual acuity. "
"Eyelid ulceration from cytomegalovirus, an unusual AIDS-defining illness.","We compare anterior segment characteristics of Filipino- versus Chinese- and Caucasian-Americans to describe the differences in risk factors among each ethnic group. A cross-sectional study was conducted among Filipino, Chinese, and Caucasian subjects without glaucoma who underwent a standardized set of ocular examinations and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (Visante ASOCT) imaging. Zhongshan Angle Assessment Program (ZAAP) 4 was used for ASOCT image analysis. The following quantitative parameters wereobtained from ZAAP: (1) angle opening distance (AOD500, AOD750), angle recess area at 750 m (ARA), and trabecular-iris space area at 500 and 750 m (TISA500, TISA750); (2) iris parameters, including iris thickness at 750 m from the scleral spur (IT750), iris area (IArea), iris curvature or convexity (ICurv), and pupil diameter; 3) anterior chamber parameters; and (4) lens vault. The Filipino (122 eyes), Chinese (121 eyes), and Caucasian (111 eyes) subject groups were similar in terms of demographic and clinical characteristics. We reported pairwise comparisons of Filipino parameter values to Chinese or Caucasian values, represented as B-coefficients and <i>P</i> values. In multivariate analysis, Filipinos had narrower angles than Caucasians (AOD750, TISA 500, TISA 750, ARA, <i>P</i> < 0.001). Filipinos had thicker and more convex irises than Caucasians (IT750, IT 2000, ICurv <i>P</i> < 0.003). Angle and iris parameters were similar overall for Filipino and Chinese. Filipinos appear to have more convex and thicker irises, smaller lens vault and narrower angles compared to Caucasians. Filipino eyes closely resembled Chinese eyes with similar iris and angle parameters. The anatomic angle parameters of Filipinos may contribute to angle closure risk among this population, thus ASOCT and thorough angle analysis is recommended in this population. "
The reliability of patient-reported mucoid reflux on nasolacrimal sac compression.,"Elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) is an important risk factor for glaucoma. We constructed polygenic risk scores (PRSs) for IOP using the UK Biobank (UKB) data set to test whether the PRSs are associated with IOP and whether using them improves glaucoma prediction. We conducted this study using 435,678 European participants from the UKB. We constructed weighted and unweighted PRSs using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) derived from the UKB data and previously reported IOP SNPs. We examined the associations of the PRSs with IOP and primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using linear and logistic regression, respectively. To quantify the discriminatory ability of the PRSs on POAG, we used the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The weighted PRS was significantly associated with IOP (<i>P</i>  10<sup>-200</sup>), after adjusting for age and sex. The PRS explained an additional 4% of variance in IOP. The weighted PRS was also significantly associated with POAG (<i>P</i> = 1.8  10<sup>-77</sup>). Subjects in the top quintile of the IOP PRS were 6.34 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 4.82-8.33; <i>P</i> = 2.1  10<sup>-57</sup>) times more likely to have POAG, compared to those in the bottom category. The weighted PRS improved the discriminatory power for POAG (AUC increased by 5%, <i>P</i> = 6.2  10<sup>-22</sup>) when added to the other covariates. The unweighted PRS exhibited similar results. We determined that IOP PRSs are significantly associated with IOP and improve the prediction of POAG. PRSs help reduce the burden of glaucoma by early detection of genetically susceptible individuals. "
Hodgkin lymphoma presenting with orbital involvement.,"Preterm infants are often exposed to both antenatal and postnatal glucocorticoids (GCs). We tested the hypothesis that combined antenatal and postnatal GCs have long-lasting adverse effects on fetal and neonatal growth, growth factors, and neurological outcomes. Pregnant rats were administered a single IM dose of betamethasone (0.2 mg/Kg, AB), dexamethasone (0.2 mg/Kg, AD), or equivalent volumes of saline (AS) at 17 & 18 days gestation. Following delivery, pups from each treatment group were sacrificed at P0, and the remainder was treated with a single IM dose of either betamethasone (0.25 mg/Kg, PB), dexamethasone (0.25 mg/Kg, PD), or equivalent volumes of saline (PS) on P5, P6, and P7. Somatic growth, neurological status, and growth factors were determined at P14, P21, and P45. At birth, AD resulted in decreased somatic growth. AB advanced the hopping reflex associated with spinal rhythmic mechanisms. At P21, all GC groups were growth suppressed, but only the AS/PD group had deficits in brain weight and delayed plantar reflex associated with brainstem function. By P45, sustained reductions in body and brain weight occurred all combined antenatal and postnatal GC groups, as well as elevated ACTH and corticosterone. Retardation in plantar reflex occurred in all AD groups. IGF-I, GH and insulin levels were elevated at all ages with dexamethasone. Combined antenatal and postnatal GCs has persistent detrimental lasting effects on growth, growth factors, neurological outcomes, and HPA axis activity. Whether these effects persist in adult life and are risk factors for insulin resistance, remains to be elucidated. "
Hemolacria revealing a primary nasolacrimal duct melanoma.,"No data are available about learning needs and career attitudes of Italian Psychiatry Residents (IPRs). Authors aimed to assess such needs through a survey to generate insight for implementing educational programs close to IPRs' perceived learning needs. A 54-item questionnaire was developed in order to investigate career information, educational preference and learning needs of IPRs. A sample of 298 IPRs participated to the survey and was divided into four subgroups according to their location (North, Centre, South and Islands). The subgroups were compared through ANOVA for age and chi-square tests for qualitative variables (including gender and all sub-items of the survey), with Bonferroni post-hoc analysis. IPRs were found to pursue, along with traditional and theoretical training, a quite practical approach, characterized by working groups, discussions on clinical cases and practical interactive sessions. The topics of major interest included: clinical psychiatry, psychopharmacology, psychiatric emergencies, communication and relationship skills (97%, 98.0%, 98.3% and 95.7% of the total sample, respectively). Indeed, a strong need for interaction with healthcare professionals emerged (97% of the total sample). North and Centre IPRs were more involved in Day Hospital activities than residents from South Italy and Islands (p<.001). South IPRs appeared to be more prone to invest for their education than residents from other areas (<i>p</i><.01). Reported findings should be taken into account as a starting point for planning and developing future targeted packages of educational proposals for IPRs and they should stand as a useful pilot study for further investigation in the field.

Severe sequential visual loss in MS co-diagnosis of Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy.,"To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in detecting vascular characteristics of chorio-retinal disease. Evidence acquisition: We searched Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline by the citation of references and complemented these electronic searches by checking the list of references of included and review articles. Screening, selection, assessment, and extraction was performed in parallel by two authors. Evidence synthesis: Systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis. The ten studies that contributed to the meta-analysis enrolled 440 eyes and allowed constructing ten two-by-two tables. The tables reported on detection of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in eyes suffering from either age-related macular degeneration (4), central serous chorioretinopathy (2), myopia (2), foveomacular vitelliform dystrophy (1), or a mixed cohort suffering from multiple retinal diseases (1). Of the ten studies, six used a cohort and four a case-control design. We found a pooled sensitivity of 0.90 (95% confidence intervals (CIs): 0.82-0.95) and a pooled specificity of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.89-0.99). Corresponding positive and negative likelihood ratios were 32.3 (95% CI: 7.4-141.6) and 0.10 (95% CI: 0.06-0.20), respectively. No pooling was possible for retinal vascular parameters of diabetic retinopathy, polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy, or detection of CNV activity. The results of highly biased and heterogeneous studies assessing the diagnostic performance of OCTA highlight the need for further analyses of methodologically sound and sufficiently sized clinical evaluations. "
Nystagmus and diplopia in a patient with positive aquaporin-4 antibody.,"The aim of this pilot study was to test whether mathematical parameters of the vascular morphology of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) can be used as biomarkers and to investigate how these parameters change during anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy. Treatment-naive CNV in exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) was diagnosed in 28 patients. OCT-angiography (OCT-A) (Avanti/FA Optovue) performed before and after anti-VEGF therapy. The OCT-A data sets were exported to an external image processing program and vessel skeletonization was accomplished by means of edge detection. Based on this technique the total vessel length, the number of segments and the fractal dimension (FD) of the CNV were calculated before and after therapy. The results were compared with other clinical parameters such as VA and central retinal thickness (RT). The total vessel length of the CNV was significantly reduced by anti-VEGF-therapy (mean value 652 pixels vs. 397 pixels; p<0.0001), as well as the number of individual vessel segments of the CNV (mean value 117vs. 76; p<0.0001). The FD of the CNV also decreased significant reduction during therapy (mean 1.23 vs. 1.16, p<0.0001). The changes in these parameters during treatment corresponded with an increase in VA and a reduction in RT. This pilot study demonstrates that the vascular pattern of CNV in AMD can be visualized and described using mathematical parameters of OCT-A. The changes during therapy correlate significantly with established ""activity"" parameters of CNV, so changes in these parameters (especially FD) may represent additional CNV ""activity"" biomarkers. "
Triple-hit lymphoma of the cavernous sinus.,"To investigate the correlation between obstructive sleep apnea(OSA) severity and the structural and functional progression in patients with glaucoma. This retrospective comparative cohort study included subjects from the polysomnography database in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital between June 1, 2009, and June 1, 2017, by identifying patients who had received diagnoses of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG), normal-tension glaucoma (NTG), or glaucoma suspect. Patients with follow-up time of <3 years and/or <3 consecutive reliable optical coherence tomography (OCT) or visual field (VF) tests were excluded. Progression of overall peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness on OCT scans and VF mean deviation (MD) or VF index (VFI) were determined through linear regression trend analysis. Thirty-two patients were included. There was a trend to higher percentage of progression on RNFL thickness and VF in higher OSAS severity. After stratifying patients to no OSA/mild OSA (group 1) and moderate/severe OSA (group 2), group 2 exhibited a significantly higher percentage of RNFL thickness progression than did group 1 (64.7% vs 26.7%, P=0.042). Multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that severe OSA had an 8.448-fold higher risk of RNFL thickness progression after age, sex, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and body mass index adjustment (95% confidence interval, 1.464-48.752, P=0.017). Severe OSA is significantly correlated with a higher risk of structural deterioration in patients with glaucoma. "
Gardening and dilated pupils: an interesting case of anisocoria from Brugmansia versicolor.,"To investigate the values of orbital single photon emission computed tomography/computerized tomography (SPECT/CT) with 99mTc-diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (99mTc-DTPA) on the evaluation of lacrimal gland inflammation in patients with thyroid associated ophthalmopathy (TAO). Methods: A total of 58 TAO patients were retrospectively recruited for this study, all of whom were categorized into all active group and all inactive group based on the clinical active score (CAS). Another 12 patients with the negative images on SPECT/CT served as a normal control group (NC). All patients were undergone the 99mTc-DTPA orbit SPECT/CT. Quantitative parameters of lacrimal gland including width, length, volume, and the count ratio of region of interest (ROI) drawn on lacrimal gland to the region of occipital brain (target/non-target ratio, T/NT), were measured on axial and coronal slices, respectively. Quantitative parameters were compared among the 3 groups, and the diagnostic value on discrimination of TAO patients from inactive to active ones was evaluated. Results: All parameters in TAO patients (except the length on coronal slices and the mean radioactive counts of axial T/NT in the TAO inactive group) were much greater than those in the NC group (P<0.05). All parameters in the TAO active group (except the length on axial and coronal slices) were much greater than those in the TAO inactive group (P<0.05). There were significant lineal positive correlations between the parameters in all TAO patients (except the length on coronal slices ) and CAS. The best diagnostic value was detected by the max radioactive counts of axial T/NT (area under the curve=0.82, P<0.01). Conclusion: As an invasive imaging modality, 99mTc-DTPA orbital SPECT/CT is helpful to estimate the lacrimal gland inflammation and to assess the disease activity in TAO patients. "
Irreversibility of transverse venous sinus stenosis and optic nerve edema post-lumbar puncture in idiopathic intracranial hypertension.,"Our recent tissue cross-linking studies using formaldehyde releasers (FARs) suggest that corneal and scleral tissue strengthening may be possible without using ultraviolet irradiation or epithelial removal, two requirements for the photochemical method in widespread clinical use. Thus, this study was carried out in order to better understand these potential therapeutic solutions by studying the effects of concentration, pH, buffer, time, and tissue reactivity on formaldehyde release of these FARs. Three FARs, sodium hydroxymethyl glycinate (SMG), 1,3-dimethylol-5,5-dimethylhydantoin (DMDM), and diazolidinyl urea (DAU) were studied using a chromotropic acid colorimetric FA assay. The effects of concentration, pH, and buffer were studied as well as the addition of corneal and scleral tissues. The main determinant of release was found to be dilution factor (concentration) in which maximal release was noted at the lowest concentrations studied (sub-millimolar). In time dependent studies, after 60 minutes, FA levels decreased by 38% for SMG, 30% for DMDM, and 19% for DAU with corneal tissue added; and by 40% for SMG, 40% for DMDM, and 15% for DAU with scleral tissue added. We conclude that concentration (dilution factor) was found to be the most important parameter governing the percent of FA released. "
Simple limbal epithelial transplantation to treat recurring kissing pterygium.,"Multidrug-resistant enterococcal strains emerged in the early 1980s and are now among the leading causes of drug-resistant bacterial infection worldwide. We used functional genomics to study an early bacterial outbreak in patients in a Wisconsin hospital between 1984 and 1988 that was caused by multidrug-resistant <i>Enterococcus faecalis</i> The goal was to determine how a clonal lineage of <i>E. faecalis</i> became adapted to growth and survival in the human bloodstream. Genome sequence analysis revealed a progression of increasingly fixed mutations and repeated independent occurrences of mutations in a relatively small set of genes. Repeated independent mutations suggested selection within the host during the course of infection in response to pressures such as host immunity and antibiotic treatment. We observed repeated independent mutations in a small number of loci, including a little studied polysaccharide utilization pathway and the <i>cydABDC</i> locus. Functional studies showed that mutating these loci rendered <i>E. faecalis</i> better able to withstand antibiotic pressure and innate immune defenses in the human bloodstream. We also observed a shift in mutation pattern that corresponded to the introduction of carbapenem antibiotics in 1987. This work identifies pathways that allow enterococci to survive the transition from the human gut into the bloodstream, enabling them to cause severe bacteremia associated with high mortality. "
Development of bilateral cataracts following electrocardioversion.,"Urinary tract disease is a common clinical presentation in dogs and cats, and a common reason for antimicrobial prescription. This document is a revision and expansion on the 2011 Antimicrobial Use Guidelines for Treatment of Urinary Tract Disease in Dogs and Cats, providing recommendations for diagnosis and management of sporadic bacterial cystitis, recurrent bacterial cystitis, pyelonephritis, bacterial prostatitis, and subclinical bacteriuria. Issues pertaining to urinary catheters, medical dissolution of uroliths and prophylaxis for urological procedures are also addressed. "
Response to Analysis of reoperation rate after strabismus surgery.,"Combination of chemotherapy and small interfering RNA (siRNA)-based nanotherapeutics could cooperatively and effectively suppress multiple drug resistance in cancer development. Particularly, nano-delivery systems that efficiently encapsulate two or more therapeutic payloads to the tumor-targeted sites have been proven significantly. Here, we prepared a micellar nanoparticle formed by monomethoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly(-caprolactone)-block-poly(L-lysine)/cholesterol (mPEG-b-PCL-b-PLL/Chol, further abbr. as ""P""). In this work, PCL as the hydrophobic core to encase doxorubicin and PLL as the cationic moiety to bind with negatively charged siRNA are used to achieve the co-delivery of therapies in one platform. The results showed that the micellar nanoparticle is capable of delivering siRNA and doxorubicin simultaneously to the same tumor cells, and consequently displays enhanced inhibition efficiency on MCF-7/ADR cells. Moreover, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and Western blot experiments indicated that the co-delivery of micelleplex-delivering B-cell lymphoma 2 specific siRNA (siBcl) successfully down-regulated the expression of Bcl-2 protein, which triggers chemotherapy to be more sensitive to the cancer cells. Therefore, the strategy of co-delivering anticancer drug and siRNA showed promising potential in reversing drug resistance of tumor cells. "
Optimizing optical coherence tomography and histopathology correlation in retinal imaging.,"Background Evidence of the role of systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) in development of severe diabetic retinopathy is not strong, although the adverse effect of low diastolic blood pressure has been a partial explanation. We assessed the predictive ability of incident severe diabetic retinopathy between pulse pressure ( PP ) which considers both SBP and diastolic blood pressure, compared with SBP . Methods and Results Eligible patients (12242, 83% men) aged 19 to 72years from a nationwide claims database were analyzed for a median observational 4.8-year period. Severe diabetic retinopathy was defined as vision-threatening treatment-required diabetic eye diseases. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that hazard ratios (95% CI ) of treatment-required diabetic eye diseases for 1 increment of standard deviation and the top tertile compared with the bottom tertile were 1.39 (1.21-1.60) and 1.72 (1.17-2.51), respectively, for PP and 1.22 (1.05-1.41) and 1.43 (0.97-2.11), respectively, for SBP adjusted for age, sex, body mass index, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, lipids, and smoking status. In a model with SBP and PP simultaneously as covariates, the hazard ratios of only PP (hazard ratios [95% CI ], 1.57 [1.26-1.96]) but not SBP (0.85 [0.68-1.07]) were statistically significant. Delong test revealed a significant difference in the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve between PP and SBP (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI ], 0.58 [0.54-0.63] versus 0.54 [0.50-0.59]; P=0.03). The strongest predictor remained as hemoglobin A1c (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [95% CI ], 0.80 [0.77-0.84]). Conclusions After excluding the significant impact of glycemic control, PP in comparison with SBP is a better predictor of severe diabetic retinopathy, suggesting a role of diastolic blood pressure and arterial stiffness in pathology.

Mean platelet volume and central retinal vein occlusion in hypertensive patients.,"Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis secondary to ocular demodicosis in the pediatric population is often neglected and may result in a serious sight-threatening condition. In severe cases, it can lead to corneal perforation necessitating urgent corneal transplantation. However, the shortage and high cost of donor corneas is the foremost limitation of keratoplasty in developing countries. Small-incision lenticule extraction is an advanced flapless femtosecond laser refractive procedure in which an intrastromal corneal lenticule is detached and removed to correct myopia and myopic astigmatism. We herein describe a technique in which lenticules are used for the management of corneal perforation secondary to Demodex-induced blepharokeratoconjunctivitis. The lenticule was sutured over the site of the perforated cornea using 10-0 interrupted nylon sutures. The globe integrity was maintained with a good visual outcome. Thus, tectonic keratoplasty using small-incision lenticule extraction appears to be a safe, cost-effective, and reliable alternative method for the management of corneal perforation secondary to blepharokeratoconjunctivitis.

Increased incidence of retinopathy of prematurity and evolving treatment modalities at a Canadian tertiary centre.,"Some studies have suggested that diabetes and XRCC gene may be risk factors for glaucoma; however, no studies have focused on the interaction between the XRCC gene and T2DM with respect to POAG risk. Therefore, the present study evaluated the initiative gene-environment interactions in POAG. "
Diagnostic occlusion test for acquired esotropia.,"Optic nerve injury is a severe complication of traumatic brain injury, which may lead to permanent and potentially loss of vision. Arbutin (ARB) is a natural hydroquinone glycoside, has been widely utilized to treat pigmented disorders. However, the role of ARB in optic nerve injury is still unclear. The study attempted to explore the effect of ARB on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced oxidative injury in RGCs. RGCs were treated with different concentrations of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to construct a cell oxidative injury model. Subsequently, the effects of ARB on these injured cells were examined through testing cell viability, apoptosis and their associated factors. MicroRNA-29a (miR-29a) inhibitor was transfected into RGCs, and the regulatory effect of miR-29a inhibition on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-injured cells was detected. Further, the important signaling pathways of MEK/ERK and p38MAPK were determined to uncover the underlying mechanism. We firstly used H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to induce RGCs injury, and subsequent experiments found that ARB significantly alleviated H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell injury in RGCs by promoting cell viability, reducing apoptosis, and regulating the protein levels of cell growth-associated factors. Increasing expression of miR-29a was observed in ARB and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treated cells. Moreover, miR-29a inhibition significantly abrogated the protective effect of ARB on H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-injured RGCs. NRAS was predicated as a direct target gene of miR-29a. Mechanistically, ARB blocked MEK/ERK and p38MAPK pathways by up-regulating miR-29a. These data demonstrated that ARB protected RGCs against oxidative injury induced by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> through blocking MEK/ERK and p38MAPK signaling pathways by up-regulation of miR-29a. "
Long-term outcomes of labial mucosal graft in conjunctivo-rhinostomy surgery.,"Kynurenine (KYN) is a metabolite of tryptophan, proposed for the treatment of corneal diseases. Our goal was to evaluate the effects of KYN on normal human corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells in vitro and the re-epithelization of corneal erosion in rabbits. In our study, we used corneal (10.014 pRSV-T) and conjunctival (HC0597) epithelium cell cultures. KYN was applied at a concentration range of 1-100 M for 24 and 48 h. We examined the effects on cellular metabolism, viability, interleukin-1 (IL-1), IL-6, IL-10 secretion, cytoskeleton organization and transwell migration ability. Following a bilateral corneal de-epithelialization, the rabbits received drops containing 1% KYN and a saline solution to the contralateral control eye, 5 times daily. Digital images were analyzed using the EPCO 2000 software. The metabolic activity of cells was slightly decreased by KYN in the corneal but not in the conjunctival epithelium. The viability of both epithelia was improved by KYN; it caused alterations in the secretion of IL-6 and IL-10 but not IL-1. It had no impact on both epithelia morphology and the organization of the cellular cytoskeleton. KYN stimulated the formation of pseudopodia projections in both epithelia in vitro, which may be important in terms of wound healing. However, there were no differences in the re-epithelization rate in vivo. At the tested concentrations, KYN was not toxic for the corneal and the conjunctival epithelium in vitro and did not affect corneal re-epithelization in rabbits in vivo. Our results suggest that KYN may be taken into consideration for the treatment of ocular disorders. "
Genetic profiling of rhabdomyosarcoma with clinicopathological and radiological correlation.,"Neural vascular barrier maintains the optimal tissue microenvironment of central nervous system in which neural cells can function normally. In various neural diseases, the decrease in oxygen concentration, hypoxia, of affected tissues is known to accelerate the disease progression through disruption of neural vascular barrier. Therefore, the clarification of mechanisms underlying hypoxia-induced disruption of neural vascular barrier would definitely lead to the establishment of new effective therapies for intractable neural diseases. In the present study, we first found that hypoxia disrupts neural vascular barrier through pathways independent of HIF-1 and HIF-2. Then, with a specific fluorescence probe for ferrous, Fe(II) ion, we have obtained the interesting data showing that hypoxia increased the intracellular level of Fe(II) ion in endothelial cells of our in vitro model for neural vascular barrier, and that hypoxia-induced disruption of neural vascular barrier could be inhibited by chelating Fe(II) ion in endothelial cells. Furthermore, in the presence of a reducing reagent for reactive oxygen species (ROS), hypoxia could not disrupt the neural vascular barrier despite that the hypoxic increase in intracellular level of Fe(II) ion was confirmed in endothelial cells. These results indicate that hypoxia-triggered increase in the level of intracellular Fe(II) ion and subsequent production of ROS, probably through Fenton reaction, are the essential pathway mediating the disruption of neural vascular barrier under hypoxia. "
Sensitivity of orbital magnetic resonance imaging in acute demyelinating optic neuritis.,"To evaluate the prevalence, clinical characteristics, and types of optic nerve involvement in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis. For this retrospective cross-sectional study, we examined all patients with active ocular toxoplasmosis referred to our Uveitis Section during the last 12 years, and we included patients with optic nerve involvement in the study. The primary outcome was the prevalence of optic nerve involvement, and secondary outcomes included the types of optic nerve involvement and the final best-corrected visual acuity after treatment. The prevalence of optic nerve involvement was 14.4%, with the leading cause being the activation of a juxtapapillary lesion (70.5%). We found papillitis in two eyes and neuroretinitis in two eyes (11.7% for each). We only detected one optic nerve involvement secondary to a distant active lesion (5.8%). Sixteen patients (94.1%) had unilateral ocular toxoplasmosis. The overall final best-corrected visual acuity after treatment was 10/10 (LogMAR = 0.0) excluding the three patients with a juxtapapillary scar involving the macula. Optic nerve involvement was common in patients with ocular toxoplasmosis. The main type of optic nerve involvement was caused by activation of an old juxtapapillary lesion. Treatment was quickly effective, but the best-corrected visual acuity was dependent on the presence of a scar in the papillomacular bundle. "
Asymmetry of the macular structure is associated with ocular dominance.,"To evaluate whether training medical residents with the Eyesi cataract surgery simulator reduces the occurrence of intraoperative complications. This was a retrospective study in which the first 10 phacoemulsification surgeries performed by two groups of second-year ophthalmology residents were evaluated, during 2014 and 2015. The first Group consisted of seven residents from 2014 who had not had previous training with the simulator. The second Group was formed of seven residents in 2015, who had completed the C-level (intermediate) training with the simulator before beginning surgery on patients. We then compared these two groups regarding the frequency of occurrence of the four main intraoperative surgical complications: posterior capsule rupture, aphakia, and nucleus fragment dislocation into the vitreous, and extracapsular conversion. A total of 140 surgeries were performed, 70 by Group 1 and 70 by Group 2. The total number of complications was 19 (27.14%) in Group 1 and nine (12.86%) in Group 2, and this reduction was significant (p=0.031). Fourteen (20%) surgeries in Group 1 and seven (10%) in Group 2 had complications. The complications were 13 posterior capsule ruptures (18.57%) in Group 1 and seven (10%) in Group 2; three eyes had nucleus fragment dislocations (4.29%) in Group 1, but only one (1.43%) in Group 2; two extracapsular conversions (2.86%) occurred in Group 1 and one (1.43%) in Group 2; and there was one aphakia (1.43%) in Group 1. The training with the Eyesi cataract surgery simulator significantly reduced the total number of intraoperative complications in the first 10 phacoemulsification cataract surgeries performed by ophthalmology residents.

Trends in low vision care provided by ophthalmologists in Ontario between 2009 and 2015.,"We aimed to assess ocular surface characteristics in children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis without thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy and compare the results with those of healthy children. Twenty-two children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis (Group 1) and 20 healthy children without any ocular and/or systemic disorder (Group 2) were enrolled in the study. Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, tear film osmolarity measurement (TearLab Osmolarity System, San Diego, CA, USA), Schirmer and tear film breakup time tests, meibography, and conjunctival brush cytology were performed and compared the results between the groups. The study group included 19 girls and 3 boys in Group 1 and 12 girls and 8 boys in Group 2 (p=0.081). Thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy was not identified in any of the patients. Mean tear film osmolarity was 310.23  11.98 mOsm/l in Group 1 and 313.60  15.03 mOsm/l in Group 2 (p=0.424). Mean Schirmer test score was lower in Group 1 (14.91  6.27) compared with Group 2 (23.60  5.63) (p=0.001). Mean tear film breakup time was lower in Group 1 (11.78  4.07) compared with Group 2 (15.1  1.6) (p=0.013). Moreover, mean meibomian gland area loss was 25.01%  10.04% in Group 1 and 16.54%  6.02% in Group 2 (p=0.002). Conjunctival cytologic analysis in Group 1 revealed grade 0 changes in 6 patients (27.3%), grade 1 changes in 14 patients (63.6%), and grade 2 changes in 2 patients (9.1%), whereas 18 patients (90%) had grade 0 changes and 2 patients (10%) had grade 1 changes (p=0.001) in Group 2. The study demonstrates several ocular surface changes in children with Hashimoto's thyroiditis. These findings may indicate a tendency for dry eye in pediatric Hashimoto's thyroiditis patients without clinical evidence of thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy. "
Randomized crossover trial comparing effectiveness and tolerability of generic and brand-name travoprost.,"To compare the intravitreal concentrations of cellular mediators involved in neurodegeneration, inflammation, and angiogenesis in patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other vitreoretinal diseases. A multiplex bead immunoassay was used to measure vitreous levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor, serum amyloid P, C-reactive protein, complement C4, alpha-1 antitrypsin, vascular endothelial growth factor, platelet-derived growth factor-AA, platelet-derived growth factor-BB, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta in patients undergoing 23-gauge vitrectomy for proliferative diabetic retinopathy and other diagnoses (control group). We evaluated 55 patients, of whom 24 had proliferative diabetic retinopathy and 31 had other diagnoses including vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, macular hole, and epiretinal membrane. Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy demonstrated increased levels of serum amyloid P (85.49 vs. 31.38 ng/mL); C-reactive protein (59.89 vs. 41.75 ng/mL), vascular endothelial growth factor (2,330.11 vs. 554.25 pg/mL; p<0.001), platelet-derived growth factor A (127.32 vs. 39.11 pg/mL), platelet-derived growth factor B (29.37 vs. 7.12 pg/mL), interleukin-6 (69.37 vs. 33.58 pg/mL), interleukin-8 (175.25 vs. 59.71 pg/mL), and interleukin-10 (3.70 vs. 1.88 pg/mL); all p<0.004 when compared with the control group. Levels of pigment epithelium-derived factor (30.06 vs. 27.48 ng/mL; p=0.295), complement C4 (570.78 vs. 366.24 ng/mL; p=0.069), and alpha-1-antitrypsin (359.27 vs. 522.44 ng/mL; p=0.264) were not significantly different between the groups. Intravitreal levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tumor necrosis factor-beta were undetectable. Serum Amyloid P, C-reactive protein, platelet-derived growth factor A, platelet-derived growth factor B, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 were correlated positively with vascular endothelial growth factor. Cellular mediators involved in neurodegeneration and inflammation demonstrated increased levels in the vitreous humor of patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and may be part of the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy. "
Secondary surgical intervention after primary glaucoma filtration surgery: an Ontario population-based study.,"We aimed to compare the thickness of anterior sclera, corneal layers, and pre-ocular tear film between patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome and healthy individuals. Fifty-one patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome and 41 healthy control participants were recruited in this cross-sectional and comparative study. The thickness of the pre-ocular tear film, corneal epithelium, Bowman's layer, stroma, Descemet's membrane, and endothelium were measured on the corneal apex. Anterior scleral thickness was measured at distances of 1 mm and 3 mm from the limbus. The anterior segment module of spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was used to measure thicknesses of pre-ocular tear film, corneal layers, and anterior sclera. Tear film thickness, Schirmer's test, and tear break up time values were significantly lower in the Sjgren's disease group than in the healthy controls (p<0.05). The thickness measurements of corneal layers and sclera were similar between the groups. Tear film thickness was moderately correlated with the Schirmer's test results (r=0.34, p=0.001), but there was no correlation between the Schirmer's test results and tear break up time (r=0.18, p=0.09). Pre-ocular tear film, as measured by anterior segment optical coherence tomography, was thinner in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome than in the healthy controls. The thicknesses of corneal layers and anterior sclera were similar between the groups. "
Toronto tele-retinal screening program for detection of diabetic retinopathy and macular edema.,"To report our experience using conventional culture methods (CM) and pediatric blood culture bottles (PBCBs) for vitreous sample culture of acute postoperative endophthalmitis. A retrospective study was conducted at the Department of Ophthalmology, Hospital das Clinicas, HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, BR, from January 2010 to December 2015, and it included 54 patients with clinically suspected acute postoperative endophthalmitis. Vitreous samples were obtained by vitreous tap or vitrectomy. Samples from January 2010 to December 2011 were cultivated in CM, whereas samples from January 2012 to December 2015 were inoculated in PBCBs. The measured outcome was the yield of positive cultures. Twenty cases were included in the CM group, and 34 cases were included in the PBCB group. The yield of positive cultures in PBCBs (64.7%) was significantly higher than that in conventional CM (35%, p=0.034). Staphylococcus epidermidis and Streptococcus viridans were the two most commonly found agents. PBCBs can be used successfully in clinically suspected endophthalmitis. The method showed a higher yield of positive cultures than the conventional method. This technique appears to have several advantages over the traditional method: it saves time, as only one medium needs to be inoculated; transportation to a laboratory is easier than in the traditional method, and there is no need to maintain a supply of fresh agar media. The use of PBCBs may be recommended as the primary method for microbiological diagnosis and is especially suitable for office settings and remote clinics. "
Canadians with visual impairment utilize home care services more frequently.,"The aim of this study was to perform an updated meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the association between G20210A polymorphism of Prothrombin gene and the risk of retinal vein occlusion (RVO), based on the available publications with inconsistent results. We utilized the Stata software to perform the heterogeneity test, association test, Begg's and Egger's tests, and sensitivity analysis. We searched three on-line databases (PubMed, Embase, and WOS) and obtained a total of 422 articles. Based on our selection criteria, 24 case-control studies were finally enrolled in this overall meta-analysis; a subgroup analysis by the factors ethnicity, control source, and RVO type was done. Through the association test of overall meta-analysis, we did not observe a significant difference between RVO cases and controls under the A vs G (allele) (z=1.49, P=0.137), A vs G (carrier) (z=1.42, P =0.155), GA vs GG (z=1.50, P=0.135), and GA+AA vs GG (z=1.50, P=0.135). Furthermore, we observed similar negative results in the association test of subgroup analysis (all P>0.05). Heterogeneity, Begg's, and Egger's tests excluded the presence of high heterogeneity and publication bias. Statistically stable results were observed in the sensitivity analyses. Based on integrated analysis of the current evidence, Prothrombin gene G20210A polymorphism is likely unrelated to the risk of RVO. "
Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty in iridocorneal endothelial syndrome and posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy.,"Though several procedures of IOL implantation have been described (sutured scleral fixation, intra-scleral fixation, angle-supported anterior chamber, and anterior chamber or retropupillary iris-claw IOLs), there are no randomized trials which are comparing different techniques. Hence, the surgical treatment of aphakia still remains controversial and challenging. The purpose of this study was to compare the long-term efficacy and the rate of complications of anterior versus posterior Iris-claw intraocular lenses (IOL) implantation to correct for the treatment of aphakia without sufficient capsule support. Consecutive eyes having secondary implantation of aphakic iris-fixated IOLs with a follow-up of at least 5 years were considered. Mean correct distance visual acuity (CDVA) changes, percentage of eyes with CDVA improvement, mean corneal endothelial cell density (CECD) loss and the rate of other complications were used for statistical analysis. The study evaluated a total of 180 eyes (Group A: 87 anterior chamber iris-claw fixation, Group B: 93 retropupillary iris-claw implantation) of 180 consecutive different patients, with aphakia of various reasons. CDVA improved significantly in both groups after surgery (P<0.001, ANOVA), and was remarkably higher than baseline in both groups from first week and during the entire follow-up (P<0.001, Tukey's Honest Significant Difference). There was no statistically significant difference in CDVA between the two groups during each follow-up visits (P = NS, unpaired t-test) and in the CDVA improvement percentage between the two groups (P = 0.882, Chi-square test). No significant changes in CECD were noted after surgery in both groups (ANOVA Group A: P = 0.067, Group B: P = 0.330P). No intra-operative complications occurred in both groups. There was no statistically significant difference in the rate of complications between the two groups (P = NS, Chi-square test), except for pigment precipitates which were higher in Group A (P<0.05, Chi-square test). Five-year follow-up shows that secondary implantation of aphakic IOLs is effective and safe for the correction treatment of aphakia in eyes without capsule support. "
Sleep outcomes associated with dry eye disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Berberine, a Chinese medical herbal extract, plays a key role in antidiabetic, antiangiogenesis, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anticancer, and antihypercholesterolemic. Our previous studies revealed that berberine exerted odontoprotective effect by increasing odontoblast differentiation. However, the mechanisms involved in the odontoprotective effect of berberine have not been fully explored. The Wnt/-catenin pathway is involved in odontoblast differentiation of dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs). If -catenin is nuclear translocation, the Wnt/-catenin pathway is activation. In this study, DPSCs were treated with or without berberine. Then, we examined the accelerative effects of berberine on odontoblast differentiation and mineralized nodules formation by real-time polymerase chain reaction, alizarin red S staining, and alkaline phosphatase staining. In addition, while treated with berberine, -catenin translocated to the nucleus evaluated by western blot and immunofluorescent staining. Our results revealed that berberine functions as a promoter of odontoblast differentiation by promoting Wnt/-catenin pathway, suggesting that it may be useful in guiding therapeutic strategies for the treatment of dental caries.

Evaluation of tear osmolarity and tear function in patients with Behet's syndrome.,"G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are the target for many drugs. Evidence continues to accumulate demonstrating that multiple receptors form homo- and heteromeric complexes, which in turn dynamically couple with G proteins, and other interacting proteins. Here, we describe a method to simultaneously determine the identity of up to four distinct constituents of GPCR complexes using a combination of sequential bioluminescence resonance energy transfer 2-fluorescence resonance energy transfer (SRET<sup>2</sup>) with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC). The method is amenable to moderate throughput screening of changes in response to ligands and time-course analysis of protein-protein oligomerization. "
Defunding preoperative histories and physical exams: putting the cart before the evidence?,"To report the 52-week treatment outcomes with intravitreal injections of aflibercept using a treat-and-extend regimen for treating macular edema secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). A retrospective analysis of patients newly diagnosed with CRVO was performed. Patients receiving aflibercept between 1 December 2016 and 31 March 2017 were included in the analysis. Data on age, gender, visual acuity measured on Early Treatment of Diabetic Retinopathy Study charts, presence of macular and peripheral ischemia, anatomical changes observed on spectral domain-optical coherence tomography examination and the number of injections needed were recorded. The mean gain in vision was 17.8  19.1 ( standard deviation) letters and 15.1  20.2 letters at weeks 24 and 52 of follow-up, respectively. The proportion of patients who gained  15 letters in best-corrected visual acuity was 52.9% at week 24 and 50% at week 52. The mean reduction in central subfield macular thickness was 331.5 and 311.6 at weeks 24 and week 52, respectively. For the patients completing 52weeks of follow-up, the mean number of treatments was 4.91.3 injections in the first 26weeks and 3.22.0 injections in the second 26weeks. The Moorfields protocol for treating macula edema in CRVO achieves a quick response to treatment without over- or under-treating patients with a fixed protocol. Overall, our individualized treat-and-extend protocol achieved real-life outcomes approaching those of clinical trials. As there are currently no such trials using this practically useful regimen, our study provides real-world evidence for using a treat-and-extend protocol for aflibercept in CRVO. "
Use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in ophthalmology patients in Alberta.,"Multiphoton microscopy allows long-term direct visualization of cells in live animals due to its low photodamage. When coupled with fluorescence protein targeting and second harmonic generation signals from natural collagen as contrast, multiphoton microscopy enables intravital tracing of cells while providing structural information from the extracellular matrix. Compared with conventional histological analysis, it can bring new insight into the cell dynamics in stem cell research. Here, we demonstrate cell imaging and tracing at a single cell resolution in the cornea, skin, and hair follicles using multiphoton microscopy in transgenic mice of which specific cell populations are tagged with fluorescent proteins. "
Evaluating the efficacy of an educational ergonomics module for improving slit lamp positioning in ophthalmology residents.,"To describe a case of bilateral multifocal stromal crystalline keratopathy in the setting of relapsing polychondritis (RP). Case report. We describe a 31-year-old woman who presented with ocular inflammation, bilateral auricular chondritis, and nasal chondritis, meeting the clinical criteria of RP. We illustrate her auricular cartilaginous abnormalities, saddle nose deformity, scleritis, and discrete mid-stromal opacities in both corneas that extend through the central cornea. Uniquely, her opacities feature a marked crystalline component as demonstrated on photography, anterior segment optical coherence tomography, and confocal microscopy. A central keratopathy is not typically reported in patients with RP. In this case report, we describe a unique diffuse bilateral nummular mid-stromal crystalline keratitis that extends into the central cornea and further define it using multimodal imaging. "
Mapping the landscape of cataract surgery teaching assessment in Canadian residency programs.,"To assess for ectopic ocular calcification in a series of patients with hypophosphatasia (HPP) treated with asfotase alfa, a recombinant tissue-nonspecific alkaline phosphatase. This is a retrospective analysis of subjects enrolled at Duke University Medical Center in ENB-009-10 (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT01163149), a randomized controlled trial of asfotase alfa in adolescents and adults with HPP. Seven patients between the ages of 45 and 66 years diagnosed with HPP based on clinical features and low serum alkaline phosphatase levels were enrolled at our site. Subjects were randomized to receive either daily subcutaneous injections of asfotase alfa or no treatment. After 24 weeks, during the open-label extension phase, all subjects received treatment for at least 4 years. All subjects underwent comprehensive eye examinations at baseline and at 24-week intervals throughout the study to assess for development of ocular calcifications. By week 120, all 7 subjects developed asymptomatic white refractile deposits in the interpalpebral perilimbal conjunctiva. Biopsy of the conjunctival lesions in 2 subjects revealed elastosis with subepithelial calcification. The lesions were nonprogressive and in 5 subjects exhibited some degree of regression. Asfotase alfa was invariably associated with development of mild focal conjunctival calcification, likely through disinhibition of hydroxyapatite crystal propagation. The calcifications were not symptomatic or vision-threatening and should not preclude enzyme replacement therapy for patients with this rare and often debilitating disease. "
Evaluation of ophthalmology clerkships across teaching sites at the University of British Columbia.,"The evaluation of palpebral laxity can be performed by the distraction test (DT). Although widely used in ophthalmologic practice, there is no consensus about the results considered normal by the test. The objectives of this study are to obtain the value of DT in a group of individuals with healthy eyelids and to compare with the measurements in subjects with senile ectropion. Lower eyelid DT was performed in 200 individuals without any eyelid pathology and in 30 individuals with lower lid ectropion. The results were analyzed by age and sex in the control group and compared with the results of the ectropion group. The mean value of DT in the control group was 6.96 mm, lower than in the ectropion group (9.48 mm) (p < 0.001). In the control group, the mean female DT was 6.70 mm, while the male was 7.22 mm. There were differences in the DT values in the subgroups of 20-39 and 40-59-year old according to gender, with men presenting higher measurements than women. In the other age subgroups, both genders presented similar DT values. Even when considering only individuals in the control group with the same range of age as in the ectropion group, the DT value was higher in individuals with ectropion (7.23 and 9.48 mm, respectively, p < 0.001). The mean DT value is 6.96 mm; however, the measurement varies according to age and sex in people without palpebral pathology. Individuals with senile eyelid ectropion present higher measurements than healthy ones. "
Preoperative fasting for ambulatory cataract surgery: asystematic review.,"Adenoviral conjunctivitis is the most common cause of conjunctivitis worldwide with no approved antiviral treatment. Benzalkonium chloride (BAK) is a common preservative in ophthalmic medications and is the active ingredient in some skin disinfectants and hand sanitizers. BAK is known to be effective in killing bacteria and enveloped viruses; however, its activity against ocular types of nonenveloped adenoviruses (Ads) is unknown. The goal was to determine whether BAK is an effective antiviral agent against common human ocular types of adenovirus in vitro. The direct inactivating activity of BAK was determined by incubating several human adenovirus types with BAK concentrations of 0.001%, 0.003%, 0.005%, 0.01%, 0.1%, and 0% for 1h at 33C. Resulting adenovirus titers were determined after treatment. Decreases in titers of 3 Log<sub>10</sub> were considered virucidal, while decreases in titers of <1 Log<sub>10</sub> were considered ineffective. BAK 0.1% was virucidal for Ad3, Ad5, Ad7a, Ad19/64, and Ad37, while it reduced titers >1 Log<sub>10</sub>, but <3 Log<sub>10</sub> for Ad4 and Ad8. Decreases in titers >1 Log<sub>10</sub> were demonstrated for BAK 0.003%, 0.005%, and 0.01% for Ad5 only. Decreases in titers for the other adenovirus types for those concentrations were 0.53 Log<sub>10</sub>. 0.001% BAK produced minimal decreases in titers for all types. BAK, at 0.01% or less was not consistently effective as an antiviral against adenovirus, but higher concentrations, such as 0.1%, should be further investigated as a possible topical treatment for adenoviral ocular infections, providing ocular toxicity is not an issue.

Simulation training in vitreoretinal surgery: a systematic review.,"Pathogenic variants in SCN8A have been associated with a wide spectrum of epilepsy phenotypes, ranging from benign familial infantile seizures (BFIS) to epileptic encephalopathies with variable severity. Furthermore, a few patients with intellectual disability (ID) or movement disorders without epilepsy have been reported. The vast majority of the published SCN8A patients suffer from severe developmental and epileptic encephalopathy (DEE). In this study, we aimed to provide further insight on the spectrum of milder SCN8A-related epilepsies. A cohort of 1095 patients were screened using a next generation sequencing panel. Further patients were ascertained from a network of epilepsy genetics clinics. Patients with severe DEE and BFIS were excluded from the study. We found 36 probands who presented with an SCN8A-related epilepsy and normal intellect (33%) or mild (61%) to moderate ID (6%). All patients presented with epilepsy between age 1.5months and 7years (mean = 13.6months), and 58% of these became seizure-free, two-thirds on monotherapy. Neurological disturbances included ataxia (28%) and hypotonia (19%) as the most prominent features. Interictal electroencephalogram was normal in 41%. Several recurrent variants were observed, including Ile763Val, Val891Met, Gly1475Arg, Gly1483Lys, Phe1588Leu, Arg1617Gln, Ala1650Val/Thr, Arg1872Gln, and Asn1877Ser. With this study, we explore the electroclinical features of an intermediate SCN8A-related epilepsy with mild cognitive impairment, which is for the majority a treatable epilepsy. "
Autophagy in Xenopus laevis rod photoreceptors is independently regulated by phototransduction and misfolded RHO<sup>P23H</sup>.,"The objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between suicidal ideation (SI), structural brain damage, and cognitive deficits in patients with penetrating traumatic brain injury (pTBI). Vietnam War veterans (n = 142) with pTBI to the prefrontal cortex (PFC) underwent combination of neuropsychological and psychiatric examinations and non-contrast CT brain scan. Patients were divided into SI positive (SI+) and SI negative (SI-) groups according to the SI item of the Beck Depression Inventory. Lesions to the left rostrolateral PFC (rlPFC) were associated with a lower risk of SI independent of depression and global functioning. Left rlPFC lesion also reduced abstract reasoning skills, which mediated the lesion effects on suicide ideation. The left rlPFC plays a crucial role in SI independently of depression and global functioning. "
Evaluation of dynamic thiol-disulfide homeostasis in glaucoma patients and the correlation with retinal nerve fiber layer analysis.,"The aim is to present the changes in ultra-widefield and widefield multimodal imaging, including optical coherence tomography angiography of a 33-year-old woman diagnosed with Susac syndrome, over 1 year of follow-up. Fundus examination and multimodal imaging revealed bilateral arterial occlusion of multiple vascular branches with retinal ischemia. Over 1 year follow-up, best-corrected visual acuity improved while retinal ischemia gradually resolved. Widefield optical coherence tomography angiography showed reperfusion of macular large vessels, but not of the small capillaries. Despite anatomical improvement, functional defects of the visual field persisted. In conclusion, widefield and ultra-widefield imaging provided high-resolution details of the central and peripheral damages in Susac syndrome. "
Complement factor B gene polymorphisms and risk of age-related macular degeneration: A meta-analysis.,"To investigate the predictive value of preoperative anterior chamber aqueous flare levels measured by laser flare photometry for surgical success of idiopathic macular holes in addition to preoperative anatomic characteristics. Records of 105 consecutive eyes with full-thickness idiopathic macular holes which underwent pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and sulfur hexafluoride 20% (SF<sub>6</sub>20%) endotamponade were reviewed retrospectively. All patients underwent preoperative measurements of anterior chamber aqueous flare and anatomical idiopathic macular hole characteristics evaluated by optical coherence tomography: macular hole inner opening diameter, macular hole minimum linear diameter, macular hole base diameter, and macular hole height. Best-corrected visual acuity results were recorded pre- and postoperatively. In 17 (16.2%) of 105 eyes primary closure of idiopathic macular hole failed, whereas in 88 eyes (83.8%) closure was achieved. Between both groups, preoperative macular hole minimum linear diameter (p=0.001) and macular hole inner opening diameter (p=0.006) were statistically different. Failure rates were significantly lower in eyes with macular hole minimum linear diameter<400m (7.4% vs 32.4%; p=0.013) and preoperative macular hole minimum linear diameter showed moderate correlation with pre- and postoperative best-corrected visual acuity results (r=0.512; p<0.001; r=0.612; p<0.001). Mean anterior chamber aqueous flare of 11.59.9pc/ms in eyes with anatomical closure and 11.86.4pc/ms in unclosed cases was comparable (p=0.28) and did not correlate with anatomical or functional results. Eyes with idiopathic macular hole400m in size have a significantly higher failure rate following standardized pars plana vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane peeling and SF<sub>6</sub>20% endotamponade. Preoperative macular hole minimum linear diameter and macular hole inner opening diameter seem to be associated with surgical outcome in idiopathic macular hole, whereas anterior chamber aqueous flare level does not provide additional predictive value.

Diagnostic conundrum of periorbital vascular lesions: from the unexpected to the typical.,"Aerobic exercise is associated with the sympathetic activation evoking adaptive responses to sustain muscle engagement. Physical exercise can cause alterations in the cardiovascular activity and cellular stress may occur which could be marked by either heart rate (HR), or galvanic skin response (GSR). Moderate plasma levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) are considered as health markers, absolving to important roles such as adaptive cellular responses to exercise. Orexin A, a hypothalamic peptide, causes a widespread stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system, playing a role in many physiological functions. "
Visual Acuity Outcomes after Cataract Surgery: High- vs. low-volume surgeons.,"To investigate the progression characteristics of ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss in eyes with macular telangiectasia type 2 (MacTel) as reflected by area and linear measurements, and their relevance for visual acuity. Participants were selected from the MacTel Study cohort. Linear and area measurements of EZ loss were performed in Spectral-Domain Optical Coherence Tomograph (SD-OCT) volume scans. Progression characteristics and correlations between linear and area measurements were analysed using linear mixed effects models. A total of 134 eyes of 70 patients were included (85 eyes with follow-up, mean 4.7years, range: 1.4-8years). Ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss significantly progressed at a mean annual increment of 0.057mm<sup>2</sup> (p=0.005). The progression rate was non-linear and interacted significantly with initial EZ lesion size indicating an exponential growth before reaching a plateau. There was a strong heterogeneity in area sizes between fellow eyes. EZ break length had a significant linear effect on EZ break area (b=1.06, p<0.001) and could predict it. The location of the EZ break had a significant impact on visual acuity. Ellipsoid zone (EZ) loss in MacTel has a non-linear progression characteristic, and its rate depends on area size at baseline, which must be taken into account at sample selection in clinical trials. Our results show a good correlation of linear and area measures of EZ loss and a segregation of best-corrected visual acuity by EZ location, which may help routine clinical practice. "
Management of orbital rhabdomyosarcoma in a child with Li-Fraumeni syndrome.,"Patients with proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) treated with panretinal photocoagulation (PRP) can have abnormal visual functioning that may be missed by Snellen visual acuity alone. We investigated reading deficits in patients treated with PRP for PDR using the Minnesota reading (MNREAD) test. Thirty patients treated with PRP and 15 controls underwent best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), the MNREAD, frequency doubling perimetry (FDP), and fundus photography. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)-treated subjects were compared to controls on MNREAD results by two-sample t-tests and Wilcoxon tests and Pearson correlations were used to assess the association between performance on MNREAD and other central visual function tests within PRP subjects. Panretinal photocoagulation (PRP)-treated patients had reduced MNREAD acuity (p<0.0001) and increased critical print size (p=0.01) compared to controls but not a significantly reduced maximum reading speed (p=0.06). Logmar MNREAD acuity was strongly positive correlated with logMAR BCVA (r=0.58, p=0.0098) and strongly negatively correlated with FDP foveal threshold (r=-0.63, p=0.0030). Maximum reading speed was positively correlated with FDP foveal threshold (r=0.57, p=0.0143) and FDP mean deviation (r=0.51, p=0.0432). Visual acuity did not correlate with the sensitivities on the FDP. The MNREAD test reveals that PRP reduces reading ability and other aspects of macular function, and thus provides new understanding of how vision-related quality of life is impaired. These findings may lead to improved means to evaluate and enhance vision following treatment for PDR. "
"Socio-economic status, visual impairment and the mediating role of lifestyles in developed rural areas of China.","To compare the cost-effectiveness of two operation methods for late in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation. In this randomized clinical trial, 104 patients were randomly assigned to IOL repositioning by scleral suturing (n=54) or IOL exchange with a retropupillary iris-claw lens (n=50). A cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was performed in conjunction with previously published 6-month efficacy and safety results. An incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was calculated as the cost difference between the operation groups relative to their difference in postoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) (mean and 95% confidence interval: minimum and maximum), reported as the cost difference in United States Dollars ($) per logMAR difference. Exchange surgery was $281.2017.66 more expensive than repositioning, mainly explained by the new IOL and the frequent use of anterior vitrectomy. A previous trial publication revealed no significant difference in the 6-month postoperative CDVA between the groups. In the CEA, the mean group difference yielded an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of -$281.20 per -0.11 logMAR (-$1108/QALY) in favour of repositioning, ranging from -$281.20 per -0.29 logMAR (-$406/QALY) in favour of repositioning to +$281.20 per -0.08 logMAR (+$1522/QALY) in favour of exchange. The CEA did not include the mean 9.5min shorter operation time for exchange. Repositioning tended to be more cost-effective than exchange; however, this is modified if also considering the operation time. Overall, it seems the cost-effectiveness is not alone sufficiently different to recommend one of the operation methods over the other for late in-the-bag IOL dislocation. "

Retinal Nonperfusion Characteristics on Ultra-Widefield Angiography in Eyes With Severe Nonproliferative Diabetic Retinopathy and Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Factors affecting visual acuity prognosis after gene therapy in Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy (LHON) patients with mutation at site 11778 are unknown. To analyse correlations between visual acuity prognosis and baseline characteristics of LHON after rAAV2-ND4 gene therapy. Retrospective study. Fifty-three LHON patients with a mutation at site 11778. Single-eye intravitreal injection of rAAV2-ND4. Sex, onset age, duration of disease, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual field index (VFI), and mean deviation (MD) were recorded for all patients at baseline. BCVA was recorded at 1- and 3-month follow-up visits after gene therapy. Correlations between BCVA prognosis and baseline characteristics were analysed by univariate analysis. Logistic regression analysis was performed on independent factors affecting BCVA prognosis. Univariate analysis showed significant differences in the VFI and MD of the injected eye between BCVA improvement and non-improvement groups after 3 months of treatment, with greater VFI and smaller absolute MD in the BCVA improvement group. Logistic regression showed that VFI and baseline BCVA were independent prognostic factors for visual acuity. The correlation between VFI and MD was statistically significant. VFI and baseline BCVA were correlated with the visual acuity prognosis of LHON patients receiving gene therapy, with greater baseline VFI and better baseline BCVA predicting better visual acuity prognosis. MD was strongly correlated with VFI and might be correlated with gene therapy prognosis. This finding may form a basis for predicting the efficacy of gene therapy in these patients and guiding subsequent treatment. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. "

"Sensitivity and Specificity of Potential Diagnostic Features Detected Using Fundus Photography, Optical Coherence Tomography, and Fluorescein Angiography for Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy.","von Hippel Lindau (VHL) disease is caused by inactivation of the VHL tumor suppressor gene, resulting in formation of multiple systemic tumors. Juxtapapillary retinal capillary hemangioma (JRCH) is one of the major manifestations in VHL disease; however, treatments are challenging, especially in children. The present study reports the case of a 6-year-old girl with suspected VHL disease presenting with JRCH. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated marked dye leakage from the tumor. Retinal hemorrhage occurred around the tumor 7 months later. Laser photocoagulation of the tumor tissue was safely and successfully conducted without general anesthesia. The hemorrhage diminished after laser photocoagulation. Optical coherence tomography demonstrated mild resolution of an elevated lesion in JRCH with contraction of the vitreoretinal interface over the tumor. Laser photocoagulation may be considered the first-line treatment for young patients with JRCH, although the primary physicians must have the necessary skills and be able to establish good doctor-patient relationships, even with children.

The Inaccuracy of Ocular Online Symptom Checkers-Googlers Beware.,"<b>Objective:</b> To assess the joint impact of cognitive performance and visual acuity on mortality over 13-year follow-up in a representative US sample. <b>Methods:</b> Data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (18 years old) were linked with the death record data of the National Death Index (NDI) with mortality follow-up through December 31, 2011. Cognitive performance was evaluated by the Digit Symbol Substitution Test (DSST) and cognitive performance impairment was defined as the DSST score equal to or less than the median value in the study population. Visual impairment (VI) was defined as presenting visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the better-seeing eye. Risks of all-cause and specific-cause mortality were estimated with Cox proportional hazards models after adjusting for confounders. <b>Results:</b> A total of 2,550 participants 60 years and older from two waves of (NHANES, 1999-2000, 2001-2002) were included in the current analysis. Over a median follow-up period of 9.92 years, 952 (35.2%) died of all causes, of whom 239 (23.1%), 224 (24.0%), and 489 (52.9%) died from cardiovascular disease (CVD), cancer, and non-CVD/non-cancer mortality, respectively. Cognitive performance impairment and VI increased the odds for mortality. Co-presence of VI among cognitive impaired elderly persons predicted nearly a threefold increased risk of all-cause mortality [hazard ratios (HRs), 2.74; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.02-3.70; <i>P</i> < 0.001) and almost a fourfold higher risk of non-CVD/non-cancer mortality (HR, 3.72; 95% CI, 2.30-6.00; <i>P</i> < 0.001) compared to having neither impairment. <b>Conclusion:</b> People aged 60 years and over with poorer cognitive performance were at higher risk of long-term mortality, and were especially vulnerable to further mortality when concomitant with VI. It is informative for clinical implication in terms of early preventive interventions. "
Diagnosing Polypoidal Choroidal Vasculopathy Without Indocyanine Green Angiography.,"To evaluate the effect of the overexpression of miR-21 on the properties of pterygium and examine whether miR-21 promotes the proliferation of pterygium cells through targeting the PTEN/AKT signaling pathway. Information regarding patient gender, age, and pterygium severity was gathered. Expression of miR-21 was obtained through examination of excised pterygium tissues and superior conjunctiva tissues with real-time PCR. Human pterygium fibroblasts (HPFs) were obtained from pterygium surgery and subjected to primary culture. The HPF cell lines were divided into a negative control group, an miR-21 inhibitor group, and an miR-21 inhibitor + VO-Ohpic trihydrate group, and then the cell viability and apoptosis and the expression of PTEN and AKT were examined. Fifty-eight subjects with unilateral primary pterygium were included. An increase in the miR-21 levels in pterygium tissue was evident compared with that in the paired normal conjunctival tissues (independent-samples <i>t</i> test, p<0.01). As the severity of the pterygium increased, the miR-21 levels increased (p=0.004, rs=0.373, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient). The miR-21 inhibitor suppressed the proliferation and induced apoptosis of HPF cells through increasing the PTEN expression, and further decreasing the expression of p-AKT, which could be reversed by the PTEN inhibitor VO-Ohpic trihydrate. Aberrant miR-21 overexpression in the pterygium could target PTEN, which contributes to abnormal proliferation of the HPF cells through depressing the PTEN/AKT pathway. The results also suggested the potential of miR-21 and the PTEN/AKT pathway as a novel therapeutic strategy for pterygium. "
JAMA Ophthalmology.,"To identify the molecular cause in five unrelated families with a distinct autosomal dominant ocular systemic disorder we called ROSAH syndrome due to clinical features of retinal dystrophy, optic nerve edema, splenomegaly, anhidrosis, and migraine headache. Independent discovery exome and genome sequencing in families 1, 2, and 3, and confirmation in families 4 and 5. Expression of wild-type messenger RNA and protein in human and mouse tissues and cell lines. Ciliary assays in fibroblasts from affected and unaffected family members. We found the heterozygous missense variant in the -kinase gene, ALPK1, (c.710C>T, [p.Thr237Met]), segregated with disease in all five families. All patients shared the ROSAH phenotype with additional low-grade ocular inflammation, pancytopenia, recurrent infections, and mild renal impairment in some. ALPK1 was notably expressed in retina, retinal pigment epithelium, and optic nerve, with immunofluorescence indicating localization to the basal body of the connecting cilium of the photoreceptors, and presence in the sweat glands. Immunocytofluorescence revealed expression at the centrioles and spindle poles during metaphase, and at the base of the primary cilium. Affected family member fibroblasts demonstrated defective ciliogenesis. Heterozygosity for ALPK1, p.Thr237Met leads to ROSAH syndrome, an autosomal dominant ocular systemic disorder. "
Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography of Retinal Arterial Macroaneurysm With Overlying Hemorrhage.,"We investigated the characteristics of the choriocapillaris flow voids using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in 85 patients (164 eyes) with hypertension (meanSD age, 5611 years; 45% women; 20% poorly controlled BP; 16% diabetes) who are without ocular diseases and determined possible correlations with systemic vascular risk factors. Data on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure (BP), serum creatinine, and urine microalbumin/creatinine ratio (MCR) were collected. Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated based on CKD-EPI Creatinine Equation. OCTA imaging (66mm scans; AngioVue) with quantitative microvascular analysis of the choriocapillaris was performed. Linear regression was used to investigate the association of systemic risk factors with area (percentage), size (pixels) and number of choriocapillaris flow voids. Diabetes (=0.33; 95% CI, 0.02 to 0.63) and daytime systolic BP (=-0.13; 95% CI, -0.24 to -0.02) were associated with areas of flow voids. Age (=0.21; 95% CI, 0.06 to 0.36) and daytime diastolic BP (=-0.18; 95% CI, -0.34 to -0.02) were associated with size of flow voids. Age (=-21.21; 95% CI, -31.79 to -10.63) and nighttime diastolic BP (=13.89; 95% CI, 0.61 to 27.17) were associated with number of flow voids. Kidney parameters were not associated with any features of flow voids. In patients with hypertension, a higher BP appeared to increase blood flow in the choriocapillaris which needs to be considered when using the OCTA to study eye diseases in hypertensives. "
A Case of Unilateral Phthiriasis Palpebrarum Infestation.,"BACKGROUND This study investigated the effect of donor-dependent factors on contamination rates of conjunctival swabs of human donor eyes. MATERIAL AND METHODS From July 2015 to September 2017 a total of 1008 conjunctival swabs from 504 consecutive human donor eyes were analyzed. Cross-tabulation, chi-squared tests, and Fisher's exact tests were used to evaluate the effect of donor-dependent factors on contamination rates of conjunctival swabs. RESULTS The mean conjunctival swabs contamination rate was 28.4%. Donors with the diagnosis of carcinoma or metastases were associated with an increased conjunctival swab contamination rate [odds ratio (OR)=1.8, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.2-2.6, p=0.007; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.6, p=0.016; respectively]. However, the age, sex, diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and donors who received chemotherapy did not significantly increase the conjunctival swab contamination risk. CONCLUSIONS Donors with the diagnosis of a carcinoma or metastases seemed to be predisposed to increased conjunctival swab contamination risk. "
Tubercular Retinal Vasculitis.,"We aimed to identify differences in cytokine/chemokine levels in the aqueous humor (AH) of primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients who suffered from scarring, compared to POAG patients with no scarring after trabeculectomy surgery. Identification of differently expressed cytokines and chemokines may help to understand scarring and fibrotic processes following trabeculectomy, and to make predictions for the outcome of fistulating surgery in the future. Furthermore, the identification of cell signaling pathways involved in fibrosis offers the opportunity for a more specific antifibrotic therapy with reduced side effects, and an improvement in long-term surgical outcome. Eight samples of AH were collected during trabeculectomy surgery and commercially available cytokine/chemokine arrays were used. Specific, differently expressed proteins (cytokines/chemokines) in AH samples from patients with positive and negative surgery outcome were detected. These proteins were classified based on their known profibrotic, inflammatory, adhesive, and apoptotic properties. Transforming growth factor  (TGF-) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were among the most important profibrotic cytokines that we detected. Differences in the fold change of protein expression were highly significant between patients after successful and failed trabeculectomy surgery, and these were processed and visualized using <i>ExprEssence</i> software.This pilot study revealed differences in concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in AH among the two examined groups of patients. Our findings suggest that a positive outcome from trabeculectomy is strongly related to an inhibition of the fibrosis process. "
Acute Phacolytic Glaucoma and Morgagnian Cataract.,"Neurologic complications of chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA) are well-known, whereas there are scarce data regarding neurologic features of milder cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome (CAPS) phenotypes. We aimed to review the neurologic features in detail and summarize the other CAPS-related manifestations in 12 children. All children with CAPS that have been followed-up from pediatric rheumatology outpatient clinic, were enrolled to the study. In addition to the neurologic examination, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brain, electroencephalography, eye examination, hearing test and intellectual assessment were done. Demographic, clinical features, genetic analysis and laboratory tests were noted from patient records and hospital database. The median age of the subjects was 7 years (range 2-19 years), with a female-to-male ratio 2/1. The phenotype was consistent with familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome in 7 patients, Muckle-Wells syndrome in 3 patients and chronic infantile neurologic, cutaneous and articular syndrome in 2 patients. Most frequently noted neurologic clinical manifestation during the entire disease course was headache (n=4/12) followed by seizures (n=3/12), papilledema (n=3/12), intellectual disability (n=2/12), aseptic meningitis (n=2/12), hearing loss (n=2/12) and optic atrophy (n=1/12). MRI of the brain revealed abnormal lesions in two patients. Uveitis or conjunctivitis were seen in two children. Overall, neurological involvement was detected in 6/12 of our cohort, of which half (n=3) was in severe form. Half of the children with CAPS exhibited neurologic manifestations with varying degrees of severity. Increased understanding and awareness of this rare but treatable syndrome among neurologists is essential. If remains untreated and unrecognized, this autoinflammatory syndrome could lead to significant morbidity and mortality. Besides complete resolution of systemic symptoms, anti-interleukin-1 treatment may also prevent progression of neurologic findings when initiated in the early stage of the disease. "
Clinical Applicability of Assessing Peripheral Nonperfusion on Ultra-Widefield Angiography: Predicting Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.,"To study the impact of corneal guttata on postoperative visual acuity and patients' self-assessed visual function after cataract surgery. Patient data from 49 Swedish cataract surgery units. Retrospective cross-sectional register-based study. Data from patients who had cataract surgery from 2010 to 2017 and completed the Catquest-9SF questionnaire were obtained from the Swedish National Cataract Register. Logistic proportional odds regression was used to model the impact of corneal guttata on the visual acuity and self-assessed visual function. Adjustments were made for age, sex, ocular comorbidities, days to follow-up, preoperative corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) and preoperative Rasch person score. The main outcome measures were postoperative CDVA and Rasch person score calculated from the Catquest-9SF questionnaire. The study comprised data from 33741 patients. Cataract surgery greatly improved CDVA and self-assessed visual function in patients both with and without corneal guttata. Still, corneal guttata was significantly associated with a poorer visual acuity and a worse self-assessed visual function after cataract surgery. The negative effect of corneal guttata on visual acuity was most prominent during the first 3weeks postoperatively, but it persisted at least 3months postoperatively. Patients with corneal guttata benefit substantially from cataract surgery but have an additional risk for inferior results compared with patients without corneal guttata. These findings could serve as valuable tools in clinical practice, in particular, when deciding to perform cataract surgery and how to inform the patient about surgical benefits and risks. "
The Retina in Alzheimer's Disease: Histomorphometric Analysis of an Ophthalmologic Biomarker.,"The purpose of this article was to evaluate monocyte count and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels and their ratio (monocyte/HDL ratio [MHR]) in patients with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). A total of 50 participants were included in the study. Participants were divided into two groups: Twenty-five patients diagnosed with BRVO and 25 participants as the control group. Ocular examination findings and hematologic parameters were accessed from the file records and database, retrospectively. The mean MHR was significantly higher in BRVO group compared to the control group (13.45.2 vs. 8.12.2, p <0.001). In receiver operating characteristics analysis, the area under the curve for MHR was 0.862, and an MHR of >9.5 predicted BRVO with a sensitivity of 76% and specificity of 70.8%. The present study showed that elevated MHR is significantly associated with BRVO. Therefore, MHR may be a useful marker for the emergence of BRVO. "
The Common Antidiabetic Drug Metformin Reduces Odds of Developing Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Dry eye syndrome (DES) is a growing public health concern with a high global prevalence; however, the fundamental processes involved in its pathogenic mechanisms remain poorly understood. In the present study, we applied nanoscale liquid chromatography and quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC/Q-TOF-MS/MS) and ultraperformance LC/Q-TOF-MS/MS technologies on tear samples obtained from 18 dry eye patients and 19 healthy controls for integrated proteomic and metabolomic analyses. Overall, 1031 tear proteins were detected, while 190 proteins were determined to be significantly expressed in dry eye patients. Further functional analysis suggested that various biological processes were highly expressed and involved in the pathogenesis of DES, especially immune and inflammatory processes. In total, 156 named metabolites were identified, among which 34 were found to be significantly changed in dry eye patients. The results highlighted the key elements, especially inflammatory-related proteins and metabolites that played important roles in the development of DES. Further, the regulatory roles of primary pathways, including complement and coagulation cascades, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and amino acid metabolism, were also identified as processes involved in DES. Collectively, our work not only provided insight into the potential biomarkers of DES for diagnostic and prognostic purposes but extended our knowledge of the physiopathology of this syndrome. "
A novel thermogel system of self-assembling peptides manipulated by enzymatic dephosphorylation.,"Dry eye is commonly treated with artificial tears; however, developing artificial tears similar to natural tears is difficult due to the complex nature of tears. We characterized and evaluated a novel artificial tear formulation with components similar to the lipid and aqueous constituents of natural tears. Nano-liposomes, composed in part of phosphatidylcholine, were dispersed in an aqueous solution of bioadhesive sodium hyaluronate. Liposome size, zeta potential, and physicochemical properties of the fresh and stored (4 C) liposomal formulation were analyzed. In vitro tolerance was tested using human corneal and conjunctival cell lines by exposures of 15 min to 4 h. The tolerance of the liposomal formulation was evaluated in animals (rabbits). The average liposome size was 186.3  7.0 nm, and the zeta potential was negative. The osmolarity of the formulation was 198.6  1.7 mOsm, with a surface tension of 36.5  0.4 mN/m and viscosity of 3.05  0.02 mPas. Viability values in the human corneal and conjunctival cell lines were always >80%, even after liposomal formulation storage for 8 weeks. Discomfort and clinical signs after instillation in rabbit eyes were absent. The new formulation, based on phosphatidylcholine-liposomes dispersed in sodium hyaluronate has suitable components and characteristics, including high in vitro cell viability and good in vivo tolerance, to serve as a tear substitute.

TAMOXIFEN-INDUCED CHORIORETINAL CHANGES: An Optical Coherence Tomography and Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Study.,"Asian ethnicity is a mostly consistent dry eye disease (DED) risk factor. Co-located ethnic population studies, reducing potential confounding effects of methodological and environmental heterogeneity, may help explain DED natural history. From 96 references identified through the systematic literature search strategy of the current review, 3 relevant studies possessed sufficient methodological homogeneity for pooled analysis. Results show earliest disparities detected between Asian and Caucasian populations being higher degrees of incomplete blinking and lid wiper epitheliopathy in pediatric Asian participants, likely associated with anatomically predisposed increased eyelid tension. Interethnic divergence in meibomian gland dropout in the young adult population follows, while other ocular surface characteristics remain within physiological limits; significant differences in meibomian gland function, tear film stability and osmolarity, DED symptomology and overall disease diagnosis (based on TFOS DEWS II criteria) do not manifest until the middle adult population; and disparities in corneal and conjunctival staining become significant only with older age. Aqueous tear deficiency appears less likely than evaporative mechanisms to be implicated in the Asian ethnic propensity towards DED development. Two retrospective studies identified in the systematic literature search, further indicate susceptibility of the Asian population to iatrogenic DED secondary to contact lens wear and refractive surgery. Overall, the observation of increasing interethnic ocular surface differences throughout life has potential to offer valuable insight into the natural history of dry eye disease development. "
Glaucoma in the Age of E-learning.,"To investigate the role of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) and NET-associated proteins in the pathogenesis of oGVHD and whether dismantling of NETs with heparin reduces those changes. Ocular surface washings from oGVHD patients and healthy subjects were analyzed. Isolated peripheral blood human neutrophils were stimulated to generate NETs and heparinized NETs. We performed in vitro experiments using cell lines (corneal epithelial, conjunctival fibroblast, meibomian gland (MG) epithelial and T cells), and in vivo experiments using murine models, and compared the effects of NETs, heparinized NETs, NET-associated proteins and neutralizing antibodies to NET-associated proteins. Neutrophils, exfoliated epithelial cells, NETs and NET-associated proteins (extracellular DNA, Neutrophil Elastase, Myeloperoxidase, Oncostatin M (OSM), Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL) and LIGHT/TNFSF14) are present in ocular surface washings (OSW) and mucocellular aggregates (MCA). Eyes with high number of neutrophils in OSW have more severe signs and symptoms of oGVHD. NETs (and OSM) cause epitheliopathy in murine corneas. NETs (and LIGHT/TNFSF14) increase proliferation of T cells. NETs (and NGAL) inhibit proliferation and differentiation of MG epithelial cells. NETs enhance proliferation and myofibroblast transformation of conjunctival fibroblasts. Sub-anticoagulant dose Heparin (100 IU/mL) dismantles NETs and reduces epithelial, fibroblast, T cell and MG cell changes induced by NETs. NETs and NET-associated proteins contribute to the pathological changes of oGVHD (corneal epitheliopathy, conjunctival cicatrization, ocular surface inflammation and meibomian gland disease). Our data points to the potential of NET-associated proteins (OSM or LIGHT/TNFSF14) to serve as biomarkers and NET-dismantling biologics (heparin eye drops) as treatment for oGVHD. "
Risk factors for Cystoid Macular Edema After Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty.,"Gene expression is generally regulated by multiple transcription factors (TFs). Despite previous findings of individual TFs regulating pancreatic -amylase gene expression, the combinatorial transcriptional regulation is not fully understood. To gain insight into multiple TF regulation for pancreatic -amylase gene, we employed a function conservation approach to predict interacting TFs regulating pancreatic -amylase gene for 3 dietary animal groups. To this end, we have identified 77, 25, and 118 interacting TFs for herbivore, omnivore, and carnivore, respectively. Computational modeling of TF regulatory networks demonstrated that known pancreas-specific TFs (e.g. GR, NFAT, and PR) may play important roles in recruiting non pancreas-specific TFs to the TF-TF interaction networks, offering specificity and flexibility for controlling pancreatic -amylase gene expression in different dietary animal groups. The findings from this study indicate that combinatorial transcriptional regulation could be a critical component controlling pancreatic -amylase gene expression. "
Association of rs613872 and Trinucleotide Repeat Expansion in the TCF4 Gene of German Patients With Fuchs Endothelial Corneal Dystrophy.,"Evaluate the safety and efficacy of OTX-101, a novel aqueous nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine (0.09%), in the treatment of subjects with dry eye disease (DED). A randomized, multicenter, vehicle-controlled, double-masked, phase 3 clinical trial. Adults (18-90 years of age) with a history and clinical diagnosis of DED, a global symptom score 40 (0-100 range), and a lissamine green conjunctival staining score of 3 and 9 (0-12 range) in at least 1 eye. Eligible subjects entered a run-in period of 14-20 days, in which all subjects administered vehicle twice daily. Subjects that remained eligible at the baseline (day 0) visit were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to twice-daily treatment with OTX-101 0.09% or vehicle for 84 days. Efficacy assessments included signs (unanesthetized Schirmer tear test, corneal and conjunctival staining) and symptoms (global symptom score) of DED. The primary endpoint was the proportion of eyes with a clinically meaningful improvement (increase of 10 mm) in Schirmer test score at day 84. Safety evaluations included adverse events (AE), visual acuity, and intraocular pressure monitoring, as well as slit-lamp and dilated ophthalmoscopy/fundus examinations. A total of 744 subjects were randomized and received study medication (371 to OTX-101 0.09% and 373 to vehicle). The primary endpoint was achieved; a significantly greater percentage of eyes in the OTX-101 0.09% treatment group experienced an increase of  10 mm in the Schirmer test score at day 84 (OTX-101 0.09%: 16.6%; vehicle: 9.2%; P < 0.001). Significant improvements relative to vehicle were also observed for corneal (days 28, 56, and 84) and conjunctival staining (days 56 and 84). The global symptom score was reduced from baseline in both treatment groups by approximately 30%; however, no significant separation between groups was observed. The OTX-101 0.09% formulation was well-tolerated. Treatment emergent AEs were primarily mild in intensity. Clinically and statistically significant improvements in tear production and ocular surface integrity were observed in subjects treated with OTX-101 0.09% for DED. The safety and efficacy results support the continued development of OTX-101 as a treatment for DED. "
Three-Year Outcome Comparison Between Femtosecond Laser-Assisted and Manual Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty.,"To investigate the optimal time for Descemet membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) graft peeling, and to analyze the rolling properties of endothelial denuded grafts in a rabbit eye model. The vertical peeling force required to peel 1mm wide Descemet membrane (DM) strips, was measured as the change in weight of the system during force application in a rabbit model. Twenty-one rabbit corneoscleral rims were stored in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) at 4C, and force analysis was performed at days 1, 5, or 21 after harvesting. After half of the strips of day 5 corneas were peeled and analyzed, the rims were moved to Optisol GS at 4C, and the remaining strips were peeled off for force analysis at day 10. Separate DM grafts (n=7) were analyzed by intraoperative optical coherence tomography (OCT) to determine the tissue rolling diameter before and after removal of endothelial cells by a swab. Unpaired t-test was used for statistical analysis. There was a decrease in DM peeling force (p=0.008) between days 1 and 5 (556.04111.76 and 324.3096.4mg, respectively), and no difference between days 5 and 21 (p=0.53). Peeling force for day 5 corneas placed in Optisol was higher at day 10 (324.3096.4 to 669.92166.24mg, p=0.005). The average rolling diameter of DM grafts was similar before and after the removal of endothelial cells (257.9131.1 and 249.8126.6m, respectively). DMEK Graft procurement could be potentially facilitated by lower DM-stromal adhesion strength at day five after obtaining corneoscleral rims, in a rabbit eye model. Time in storage medium may influence adhesion strength. Endothelial cells do not appear to play a significant role in the rolling diameter of DM grafts. "
TIMP-1 Mediates Inflammatory and Immune Response to IL-6 in Adult Orbital Xanthogranulomatous Disease.,"To describe the occurrence of epiretinal membrane (ERM) in eyes with vitreomacular traction and to correlate the presence of ERM with retinal structural alterations detected using spectral domain optical coherence tomography. In this retrospective observational cross-sectional study, we collected data from 502 eyes (307 patients) with diagnosis of vitreomacular traction. The presence of ERM and retinal lesions (cystoid cavities, neuroepithelial detachment, external limiting membrane, and ellipsoid zone discontinuity) was determined by standardized grading of macular spectral domain optical coherence tomography scans. The occurrence of ERM in eyes with vitreomacular traction was 37.5%. The mean  SD central foveal thickness was 411  60 m in eyes with ERM and 380  148 m in eyes without ERM (P < 0.05). The occurrence of cystoid cavities (38.3% vs. 23.2%, P < 0.05), neuroepithelial detachment (24.5% vs. 9.9%, P < 0.0001), external limiting membrane discontinuity (16.5% vs. 5.1%, P < 0.0001), and ellipsoid zone discontinuity (13.3% vs. 6.7%, P < 0.05) was higher in eyes with ERM. The mean  SD best-corrected visual acuity was 0.45  0.16 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/50) in eyes with ERM and 0.37  0.09 in eyes without ERM (Snellen equivalent of approximately 20/40, P < 0.0001). Symptoms of metamorphopsia were present in 55 of 188 eyes with ERM (29.3%) and 40 of 314 eyes without ERM (12.7%, P < 0.0001). This study reported the occurrence of ERM in eyes with vitreomacular traction and demonstrated that ERM is significantly associated with an increased occurrence of other structural changes of the neuroretina and a negative effect on quantity and quality of vision.

Higher TGF-2 Level in the Aqueous Humor of the Second Eye Versus the First Eye in the Course of Sequential Cataract Surgery.,"To describe a novel reverse suture approach to safely and securely refixate dislocated intraocular lenses (IOLs). We describe two cases herein where we use a reverse suture technique to refixate dislocated IOLs. By reversing the needle-holder grasp on a Gore-Tex suture needle, we can safely insert the base of the needle through the pars plana. This allows for looping of the suture around the haptic of subluxated or dislocated IOL. We use the technique in a case with a subluxed plate haptic IOL and a subluxed three-piece IOL with an encircling capsular tension ring. The reverse suture technique allows for safe and effective looping of a subluxed IOL haptic or capsular tension ring. This technique can be performed without an assistant and prevents excessive manipulation and unnecessary explantation of dislocated IOL. The reverse suture technique is a safe, effective, and easily reproducible maneuver to refixate dislocated IOLs. "
The role of autophagy in the pathogenesis of exposure keratitis.,"This study assessed the efficacy and safety of early vitamin A (VA) supplementation to improve outcomes of retinopathy of prematurity in extremely preterm infants. A total of 262 eligible extremely preterm infants underwent randomization; of these, 132 were assigned to the VA group and 130 to the control group. The infants were administered a solution of VA (1,500 IU/day), added to their enteral feeds as soon as minimal feeding was introduced and continued for 28 days or until discharge. With no adverse effects occurring, serum VA of the VA-supplemented infants on Days 14, 28, and postmenstrual 36 weeks was higher than that of the placebo group (P < 0.001). No signs of VA toxicity or increased intracranial pressure were reported. The VA group had lower unadjusted rates of Type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (1.6 vs. 6.9%, P = 0.030) and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (18.9 vs. 33.8%, P = 0.008) than the control group. Regression analysis revealed an association between serum VA levels and risk of Type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (beta = -2.37). Vitamin A supplementation reduced VA deficiency in extremely preterm infants; it was associated with a decreased incidence of Type 1 retinopathy of prematurity and may also have a positive impact on reducing bronchopulmonary dysplasia.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

HMGB1 is Associated with the Inflammatory Pathogenesis of Graves' Orbitopathy.,"To characterize the inflammatory response and determine the no-observable-effect level (NOEL) in cynomolgus monkey eyes after intravitreal (ITV) injection of endotoxin. The inflammatory response to endotoxin was assessed in a single-dose study in monkeys at doses of 0.01 to 0.51 endotoxin units (EU)/eye. Tolerability was assessed by clinical ophthalmic examinations, intraocular pressure measurements, fundus color photography, optical coherence tomography, and anatomic pathology. ITV injection of endotoxin at 0.04 EU/eye resulted in a dose-related anterior segment inflammatory response. No aqueous flare or cell was noted in the 0.01 EU/eye dose group. A more delayed posterior segment response characterized by vitreous cell was observed beginning on day 5, peaking on day 15, and decreasing in some groups. Microscopic findings of mononuclear cell infiltrates in the vitreous were observed in eyes given 0.21 EU/eye. The NOEL for ITV endotoxin in cynomolgus monkeys was 0.01 EU/eye, suggesting that this species is as sensitive as rabbits to the effects of endotoxin. The vitreous cavity also appears more sensitive to endotoxin than the anterior segment/aqueous chamber. Overall, the magnitude of the inflammatory response at 0.04 EU/eye suggests that dose-response curve in monkeys is steeper than in rabbits. These data highlight the importance of assessing endotoxin level in ITV formulations, as levels as low as 0.04 EU/eye may confound the safety evaluations of ITV therapeutics in cynomolgus monkeys. "
Endothelial keratoplasty for corneal endothelial dystrophy in a dog.,"To determine the prevalence of posterior segment manifestations among consecutive patients with pathological myopia attending our University Hospital general ophthalmology clinic and their association with age, refractive error, axial length and each other. Patients diagnosed with pathological myopia underwent full ophthalmological examination, optical coherence tomography, fluorescein angiography, and ocular ultrasonography. Manifestations detected were recorded for each eye and their prevalence and association with age, refractive error, axial length and each other was determined. A total of 127 eyes of 77 patients with pathological myopia were examined. The most prevalent manifestation was peripheral retinal lesions, found in 63.8% of examined eyes, followed by tigroid fundus, found in 59.1%. Peripheral lesions were significantly associated with more myopia (P = 0.02) and longer axial length (P = 0.046). The commonest peripheral lesion was white without pressure, found in 37.8% of eyes. Lattice degeneration was found in 11.8% and snail track degeneration in 4.7% and were not associated with degree of myopia or axial length. Diffuse chorioretinal atrophy was present in 40.9% of eyes, while patchy atrophy was present in 18.9%. Macular holes were present in 4.7% of eyes and were significantly associated with foveoschisis (P = 0.035) and retinal detachment (P = 0.003), while foveoschisis was present in 5.5% and was significantly associated with older age (P = 0.012), longer axial length (P = 0.010) and patchy chorioretinal atrophy (P = 0.024). Retinal detachment was found in 6.3% of eyes and retinal breaks in 4.7%. Posterior staphyloma was detected in 33.1% and lacquer cracks and choroidal neovascular membranes in 6.3% of eyes. The prevalence of pathological myopia manifestations may differ between different populations. This may be due to the multiple genetic and environmental factors involved which may result in a variable natural history of the condition among different populations. "
Cytomegalovirus Retinitis in Children and Adolescents with Acute Leukemia following allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation.,"To describe the annual incidence rate of keratoconus in Denmark 1995-2015 and prevalence of keratoconus in the National Danish Patient Register 1977-2015. All patients diagnosed with keratoconus in the National Danish Patient Register 1977-2015 were included in the study. The annual incidence rates and the overall prevalence of diagnosed keratoconus in the register were calculated using life tables from the general Danish population. A sub-analysis excluding immigrants and descendants was performed. An increase in the annual incidence rate was seen from 1.24 per 100000 person-years in 2003 to 3.83 per 100000 in 2011. The average incidence rate 2011-2015 was 3.60 per 100000 person-years. A survey of primary-sector ophthalmologists supported that the register data could be considered complete from 2011. The prevalence of diagnosed keratoconus in the National Patient Register 1977-2015 was 44 per 100000 persons. Excluding immigrants and descendants yielded an average incidence rate 2011-2015 of 2.89 per 100000 person-years and a prevalence of diagnosed keratoconus in the National Patient Register 1977-2015 of 40 per 100000 persons. The present incidence rate (based on 2011-2015 data) has increased 2-3-fold during the last 10-15years. The increase is possibly largely a consequence of more complete data due to the availability of corneal cross-linking, which has changed the referral pattern from the primary sector. Other factors such as better diagnostic tools and immigration may also play a role. "
Factors Associated with PrEP Refusal Among Transgender Women in Northeastern Brazil.,"The aged population is constantly growing, thus fostering an increase in age-dependent diseases. Among these, diabetic retinopathy (DR) along with age-related macular degeneration entails progressive vision loss. Since such conditions are associated with the proliferation of novel vessels, their pharmacotherapeutic management consists of the intravitreal injection of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor drugs, able to hinder the driving of vascular proliferation prompted by vascular endothelial growth factor. The humanized anti-vascular endothelial growth factor monoclonal antibody ranibizumab provided evidence for efficacy in several trials, hence earning approval by the US Food and Drug Administration for therapeutic use in all the stages of DR. Due to the lack of epidemiologic and pharmacoeconomic evaluation in the local Calabria Region context, the present retrospective observational study focused on prevalence of DR and age-related macular degeneration, treatment and cost of therapy with ranibizumab in 870 patients arriving to clinical observation at the ""Mater Domini"" University Hospital in Calabria, Italy from January 2014 to June 2017. Data were extracted from the database of ophthalmology ward and subjected to statistical analysis. The results suggest that the most frequent retinal diseases are age-related macular degeneration and DR and that the use of ranibizumab has been decreasing over the 4-year study period together with the associated cost per patient which was similar for both disorders. Therefore, appropriateness of treatment with drugs other than ranibizumab needs to be assessed in this setting and deep monitoring of pharmacologic treatment for retinal diseases is necessary to prevent or delay visual acuity decrease and complete vision loss. Study procedures were performed in accordance with the ""Mater Domini"" University Hospital ethical standards of the responsible committee on human experimentation. "
Separate Gene Transfers into Pre- and Postsynaptic Neocortical Neurons Connected by mGluR5-Containing Synapses.,"Epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is a transmembrane glycoprotein involved in cell proliferation and differentiation. Ribosomal inactivating proteins derived from plants specifically target ribosomes and irreversibly inhibit protein synthesis. EpCAM antibody and saporin were conjugated using 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide hydrochloride/<i>N</i>-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The mass of the conjugates were characterised using matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation (MALDI). The saporin-EpCAM (SAP-EpAB) conjugates were tested <i>in-vitro</i> against MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), WERI-Rb1 (retinoblastoma) cells. The flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy were performed to show the binding efficiency of SAP-EpAB conjugate. Whole transcriptome changes of sap-conjugate treated cells were studied using affymetrix microarrays. MALDI-TOF analysis and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis confirmed the conjugation of SAP with EpCAM antibody. Flow cytometry and fluorescent microscopy analysis revealed the binding of SAP-EpAB conjugates to the MCF-7, WERI-Rb1 cells. Apoptosis assay by annexin-V has shown an increased apoptotic and necrotic population in conjugate treated cells. MTT assay confirmed the tumour cell death and had shown the IC<sub>50</sub> value of 0.8g for conjugate in MCF-7 (breast cancer cells), and 1g for WERI-Rb1 (retinoblastoma) cells. The microarray analysis revealed downregulation of the tumourigenic genes and upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes leading to apoptosis of tumour cells. "
Paracentral Acute Middle Maculopathy Treated with Acupuncture: A Case Report.,"To study the development, characterisation, and drug release of one- and two-layered thin films based on organic polymers [poly(D,L-lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) lactide:glycolide (65:35), poly(D,L-lactide-<i>co</i>-glycolide) lactide:glycolide (75:25), and polycaprolactone] and dexamethasone. To examine their applicability for intraocular lenses (IOLs) and function in intraocular drug delivery systems. Four series of thin films, single and double-layer, were prepared by the spin-coating method on a silicon substrate. The films were studied using atomic force microscopy and spectroscopic ellipsometry. The release rate of dexamethasone was studied for a period of ten weeks. Series A and C demonstrated the formation of large dexamethasone aggregates. The monolayer films of series C and D formed pores, in agreement with previous findings. The spectroscopic ellipsometry study demonstrated that the samples were transparent. The drug release study demonstrated that dexamethasone was released during the first 6 weeks at a desirable rate. The films exhibited properties suitable for use in intraocular drug delivery systems. The single-layer thin films demonstrated a sufficient encapsulation of dexamethasone and appropriate release of the therapeutic substance. Further studies are necessary to investigate the possibility of developing the films directly on the surface of the IOL. "
A novel strategy for quantification of panoramic en face optical coherence tomography angiography scan field.,"Damage to the optic radiations or primary visual cortex leads to blindness in all or part of the contralesional visual field. Such damage disconnects the retina from its downstream targets and, over time, leads to trans-synaptic retrograde degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. To date, visual ability is the only predictor of retinal ganglion cell degeneration that has been investigated after geniculostriate damage. Given prior findings that some patients have preserved visual cortex activity for stimuli presented in their blind field, we tested whether that activity explains variability in retinal ganglion cell degeneration over and above visual ability. We prospectively studied 15 patients (four females, mean age = 63.7 years) with homonymous visual field defects secondary to stroke, 10 of whom were tested within the first two months after stroke. Each patient completed automated Humphrey visual field testing, retinotopic mapping with functional magnetic resonance imaging, and spectral-domain optical coherence tomography of the macula. There was a positive relation between ganglion cell complex (GCC) thickness in the blind field and early visual cortex activity for stimuli presented in the blind field. Furthermore, residual visual cortex activity for stimuli presented in the blind field soon after the stroke predicted the degree of retinal GCC thinning six months later. These findings indicate that retinal ganglion cell survival after ischaemic damage to the geniculostriate pathway is activity dependent. "
Outcomes of 25-gauge vitrectomy with relaxing retinectomy for retinal detachment secondary to proliferative vitreoretinopathy.,"Mutations in the human <i>BEST1</i> gene are responsible for a number of distinct retinal disorders known as bestrophinopathies, for which there are no current treatments. The protein product, bestrophin-1, is expressed in the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) where it localizes to the basolateral membrane and acts as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated chloride channel. Recent studies have shown successful BEST1-mediated gene transfer to the RPE, indicating human clinical trials of BEST1 gene therapy may be on the horizon. A critical aspect of such trials is the ability to assess the efficacy of vector prior to patient administration. Here, an assay is presented that enables the quantitative assessment of AAV-mediated BEST1 chloride conductance as a measure of vector efficacy. Expression of BEST1 following transduction of HEK293 cells with AAV.BEST1 vectors was confirmed by liquid chromatography, Western blot, and immunocytochemistry. Whole-cell patch-clamp showed increased chloride conductance in BEST1-transduced cells compared to sham-transduced and untransduced controls. Exogenous chloride current correlated to BEST1 expression level, with an enhanced AAV.BEST1.WPRE vector providing higher expression levels of BEST1 and increases in chloride conductance. This study presents <i>in vitr</i>o electrophysical quantification of bestrophin-1 following AAV-mediated gene transfer, providing vital functional data on an AAV gene therapy product that will support a future application for regulatory approval.

Early Ganglion Cell or Macular Vessel Loss After Acute Nonarteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy?,"To find the potential relation between changes in retinal large vessels and terminal vessels using colour Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and to compare the respective advantages of CDFI and OCTA in evaluating vascular changes in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients. A prospective series of case study was conducted to enrol RP patients and age-matched controls, who were, respectively, imaged by CDFI and OCTA. Repeatability and reproducibility of both CDFI and OCTA were performed among healthy volunteers. The central retinal artery (CRA) was detected by CDFI analysis to provide parameters of peak systolic velocity (PSV), end-diastolic velocity (EDV) and time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMV). Retinal parameters were evaluated from OCTA images, including vascular area density (VAD) of the superficial vascular layer, the fovea avascular zone (FAZ) area and retinal thickness. RP patients were separated into a high-vision group and a low-vision group, according to median vision (0.3, LogMAR 0.5). Multiple comparisons were used to analyse the data between groups. A correlation analysis was used to determine the correlation between CDFI and OCTA parameters. Twenty RP patients (40 eyes) and thirteen normal volunteers (26 eyes) were enrolled in this study. Repeatability and reproducibility of the measurements by CDFI had higher CVs, from 4.5% to 15.4%, than those measurements by OCTA (<5%). All the CDFI and OCTA parameters examined had significant reductions in RP patients compared to those in the controls (p<0.01). Compared to the high-vision group, the low-vision group exhibited a statistically significant decrease in vascular parameters of the FAZ area, fovea VAD and parafovea nasal side VAD (p<0.05); as well as in the parameters of the fovea thickness, and the parafovea nasal, superior and inferior side thickness (p<0.05). From the correlation analysis, a significant association was found between the vision and CDFI parameters (PSV and time-averaged maximum velocity (TAMX), p<0.05), and the vision and OCTA parameters (FAZ area, fovea and nasal side VAD, retinal thickness in all sides, p<0.05). PSV and TAMX of the CRA were closely related to the OCTA superficial VAD in all sides, whereas the CDFI parameters showed poor correlation with retinal thickness. Colour Doppler flow imaging (CDFI) and OCTA parameters revealed a significant reduction in RP patients when compared to the controls. OCTA can detect vision-related microvascular and thickness changes around the macula between high- and low-vision groups, which happen earlier than the changes in large vessels. In addition to good repeatability and reproducibility, OCTA may have significant utility in the diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression in RP patients. "
Anterior Segment Parameters of Filipino-Americans Compared to Chinese-Americans and Caucasian Americans Using Anterior Segment Optical Coherence Tomography.,"Abnormal retinal neovascularization associated with various retinopathies can result in irreversible vision loss. Although the mechanisms involved in this occurrence is unclear, increasing evidence suggests that aberrant Wnt signaling participates in the pathogenesis of abnormal neovascularization. Because Wntsignaling upregulation can be induced by oxidative stress through the activation of disheveled (DVL), a key molecule in the Wntsignaling pathway, we investigated whether oxidative stress can activate Wnt signaling and induce angiogenic phenotypes in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs). We found that increased Wntsignaling activity, as well as enhanced angiogenic phenotypes, such as tube formation and cell migration, were detected in the hydrogen peroxide-treated HRMECs. Moreover, these effects were effectively suppressed by a small-molecule Wnt inhibitor targeting the PDZ domain of DVL. Therefore, we propose that targeting abnormal Wnt signaling at the DVL level with a small-molecule inhibitor may represent a novel approach in retinal neovascularization treatment and prevention. "
Polygenic Risk Score Is Associated With Intraocular Pressure and Improves Glaucoma Prediction in the UK Biobank Cohort.,"The optimal size selection of laryngeal mask airway (LMA) based on body weight is not always applicable. This study was prospectively conducted to evaluate the efficacy of cricoid-mental distance-based method versus weight-based method in optimal size selection of LMA in adults. Seventy-four patients (aged from 18 to 65) undergoing ophthalmic surgery were randomly assigned into cricoid-mental (CM) distance-based group or weight-based group to select appropriate size of LMA. The primary outcome was oropharyngeal leak pressure (OLP). Secondary outcomes included overall insertion success rate, number of insertion attempts, time to successful insertion, ease of insertion, score of fiber-optic view, peak inspiratory pressure during mechanical ventilation and postoperative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity. The OLP was significantly higher in CM distance-based group than that in weight-based group (19.383.52 vs. 17.503.18, P=0.022). The successful placement at the first attempt in CM distance-based group was dramatically increased as compared with weight-based group (89.2% vs. 62.2%, P=0.005). The overall success rate of LMA insertion in CM distance-based group was slightly increased in comparison with the weight-based group (100% vs. 91.9%, P=0.240). There were no significant differences in score of fiber-optic view and postoperative pharyngolaryngeal morbidity between both groups (all P>0.05). CM distance-based criteria is an alternative choice for optimizing size selection of classic LMA in adults. "
"Combined antenatal and postnatal steroid effects on fetal and postnatal growth, and neurological outcomes in neonatal rats.","Autosomal recessive spastic ataxia of Charlevoix-Saguenay (ARSACS) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the triad of early-onset cerebellar ataxia, peripheral sensorimotor neuropathy, and lower limb spasticity. Here, we present a 28-year-old male patient with symptoms of ARSACS and mild intellectual disability from a consanguineous family of tribal J&K, India. Whole exome sequencing unraveled a novel homozygous frameshift SACS mutation (Cys2869ValfsTer15) in the patient. In addition to the well-established ARSACS imaging features, MRI revealed T2 hyperintense rim around the thalami (""bithalamic stripes"") demonstrating that this feature might serve as an additional supportive diagnostic imaging marker for ARSACS. Moreover, retinal nerve fiber layer thickening which has recently been proposed as a diagnostic biomarker for ARSACS was present on routine optic coherence tomography (OCT) also in this patient, indicating that it might indeed present a relatively universal diagnostic biomarker for ARSACS. In sum, our findings extend the geographical distribution of ARSACS to even very remote tribal regions in Asia (such as the Rajouri region of J&K, India) and extend the mutational and imaging spectrum of ARSACS. They provide further support that brain imaging and OCT markers might serve as diagnostic biomarkers for ARSACS in patients with novel SACS mutations, applicable even in remote regions of the world to identify and confirm ARSACS disease.

Assessing Learning Needs and Career Attitudes of Italian Psychiatry Residents: Results from a National Survey Conducted by the Italian Society of Psychopathology Young Psychiatrists Section (SOPSI-GG).,"We report an 8-year-old girl who experienced daily episodes of visual and somesthetic distortion and was diagnosed with Alice in wonderland syndrome (AIWS). Ophthalmologic assessment revealed best-corrected visual acuity of 0.2 in both eyes, and bilateral constricted tubular or spiral visual fields. Augmented amplitude of visually evoked potentials was revealed, and treatment with lomerizine and valproate showed favorable effect on the visual/somesthetic distortion as well as the visual field and acuity. Psychogenic visual problems can co-exist with the typical sensory distortion in AIWS, similarly to the case of psychogenic pseudo-seizures in subjects with epilepsy. Otherwise, an ambiguous borderline between psychological and physical pathomechanisms in migraine may also be characteristic of the migraine-related AIWS. "
Test performance of optical coherence tomography angiography in detecting retinal diseases: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"We aimed to assess the role of 21-gene recurrence score (RS) in the decision-making for surgical treatment in early stage breast cancer and compared the outcomes between breast-conserving surgery (BCS) and mastectomy (MAST) among various 21-gene RS groups. We included patients with stage T1-2M0M0 and estrogen receptor-positive breast invasive ductal carcinoma who underwent BCS + radiotherapy or MAST between 2004 and 2012 as part of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results program. Data were analyzed using binomial logistic regression, multivariate Cox proportional hazards models, and propensity score matching (PSM). We enrolled 34,447 patients including 22,681 (65.8%) and 11,766 (34.2%) who underwent BCS and MAST, respectively. Patients with high-risk RS were more likely to receive MAST. Multivariate analysis indicated that patients with intermediate-risk (<i>P</i><0.001) and high-risk (<i>P</i><0.001) RS had poor breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS), as compared to those with low-risk RS. Moreover, patients who underwent MAST also exhibited poor BCSS (<i>P</i><0.001), as compared to those who underwent BCS. In low-risk (<i>P</i><0.001) and intermediate-risk (<i>P</i>=0.020) RS groups, patients who underwent MAST had poor BCSS, as compared to those treated with BCS. However, BCSS was comparable between patients who underwent MAST and BCS (<i>P</i>=0.952); similar trends were also observed after PSM. The 21-gene RS may impact the decision-making for surgery in early stage breast cancer. Our study provides additional support for a shared decision-making process for BCS when both local management options are appropriate choices regardless of the 21-gene RS. "
Optical coherence tomography angiography of types 1 and 2 choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration during anti-VEGF therapy: evaluation of a new quantitative method.,"To evaluate the clinical safety and efficacy of povidone-iodine (PVP-I) 0.6%/dexamethasone (DEX) 0.1% ophthalmic suspension vs vehicle in patients with clinically suspected acute viral conjunctivitis. This was a randomized, double-masked, parallel-group, vehicle-controlled study. Adults with a clinical diagnosis of suspected acute viral conjunctivitis were randomized 1:1 to PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension or vehicle bilaterally four times daily for 5 days (Days 1-5). Evaluation was on Days 1, 3 (+1-day window), and 6 (+1). Patients with signs of acute viral conjunctivitis at the Day 6 visit received open-label PVP-I/DEX for five additional days and were evaluated on Day 11-14. The primary efficacy endpoint was clinical resolution of acute viral conjunctivitis in the study eye at the Day 6 visit. Overall, 132 patients were randomized and received treatment (PVP-I/DEX, n=66; vehicle, n=66); 38 patients continued into the open-label portion of the study. Not enough patients with confirmed adenoviral conjunctivitis (n=32/132) were enrolled to assess the primary endpoint, although there were some efficacy trends in the PVP-I/DEX group for global clinical score (sum of watery conjunctival discharge and bulbar conjunctival redness). There were no serious treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) and no patients discontinued due to a TEAE. In the masked phase, 56.1% of patients receiving PVP-I/DEX experienced at least one TEAE vs 43.9% in the vehicle group; 78.9% of patients in the open-label phase experienced at least one TEAE. Most TEAEs were mild in severity. PVP-I/DEX ophthalmic suspension administered for 14 days had a favorable safety profile and was generally well tolerated. "
Correlation between structural progression in glaucoma and obstructive sleep apnea.,"To assess outcomes of resident-performed small incision cataract surgery (SICS) at a single academic institute and to determine the availability of SICS-oriented educational resources in residency programs across the USA. A retrospective chart review was conducted on all patients who underwent SICS performed by postgraduate year 4 residents between January 2014 and January 2018 at the Wilmer Eye Institute, Baltimore, MD, USA. Postoperative visual acuity, intraoperative complications, and postoperative complications were the main outcomes measured. In addition, a survey was administered to all ophthalmology residency program directors in the USA to assess the presence of SICS-related content in their surgical training curriculum. Twenty-two eyes of 17 patients underwent planned resident-performed SICS, mainly for white cataracts. Intraoperative complications occurred in two (9.1%) eyes. The most common postoperative complication was transient increased intraocular pressure (two eyes, 9.1%). Mean preoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) was approximately 20/4,000. The large majority (95.2%) of eyes experienced improved BCVA following SICS, with a mean postoperative BCVA of 20/138 over an average follow-up of 4.2 months. Forty-seven programs responded to the survey (40.1% response rate). Residents were trained in SICS in 66.7% of these programs. However, more than half of all the programs did not have SICS-oriented educational resources available for residents. Resident-performed SICS was found to be a safe and effective technique for cataract management. Considering the limited surgical volume for SICS in the USA, training programs might instead consider implementing SICS-oriented content in their surgical curriculum, including wet labs. "
[Efficacy of 99mTc-DTPA orbital SPECT/CT on the evaluation of lacrimal gland inflammation in patients with thyroid associated ophthalmopathy].,"This study aimed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab (IFX) and cyclosporine (CsA) combination therapy for refractory uveoretinitis in Behet's disease (BD). The study involved a retrospective review of the medical records of 11 patients with Behet's uveoretinitis refractory to conventional treatment who had been treated with IFX+CsA combination therapy. The frequency of ocular inflammatory attacks and a Behet's disease ocular attack score 24 (BOS24) were used as indices for the evaluation of efficacy during each 6-month period prior to and following initiation of therapy. For the assessment of safety, adverse events (AEs) were recorded throughout the treatment period. The patients had received IFX+CsA combination therapy for 5.62.3 years. The frequency of ocular attacks per 6-month period decreased markedly from 2.91.6 during the baseline period to 0.60.9 during months 1-6, 0.50.9 during months 7-12, 0.30.5 during months 13-18, 0.30.7 during months 19-24, and 0.00.0 thereafter (<i>P</i>=0.003). The BOS24 score per ocular attack significantly decreased from 5.22.4 during the baseline period to 1.52.1 during months 1-6, 1.73.1 during months 7-12, 1.62.9 during months 13-18, and 0.41.0 during months 19-24 (<i>P</i>=0.002). No serious AEs were observed, with the exception of urinary tract infection and cataract progression. Two patients exhibited transient elevation of the serum creatinine level, which was normalized following a reduction in the dose of CsA. For refractory Behet's uveoretinitis, IFX+CsA combination therapy offers a promising treatment option as it appears to have an acceptable safety profile and can reduce the frequency and severity of ocular inflammatory attacks over a long period of time.

Topical therapeutic corneal and scleral tissue cross-linking (TXL) solutions: in vitro formaldehyde release studies using cosmetic preservatives.,"Internal-tamponade agents are crucial surgical adjuncts in vitreoretinal surgery. Clinically used endotamponade agents act through buoyancy forces, yet can result in prolonged post-operative positioning, temporary loss of vision, raised intra-ocular pressure, cataract formation or the need for additional removal surgery. Here, we describe a thermogelling polymer that provides an internal tamponade effect through surface tension and swelling counter-forces. We tested the long-term biocompatibility of the polymer endotamponade in rabbit vitrectomy models, and its surgical efficacy and biocompatibility in a non-human primate retinal-detachment model. We also show that, while the thermogel biodegrades during the three months following surgery, it promotes the reformation of a vitreous-like body that mimics the biophysical properties of the natural vitreous. The thermogelling endotamponade might serve as a long-term vitreous substitute. "
Impact of antibiotic treatment and host innate immune pressure on enterococcal adaptation in the human bloodstream.,"To evaluate the choroidal thickness (CT) in foveal and parafoveal regions in Thai adults using swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT). We enrolled healthy volunteers 18 years of age from King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Thailand, during September 2015 to March 2016. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) of the macula was performed, and subfoveal CT was measured manually using a line scan. Average thicknesses of retinal and choroidal layers in regions of the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study grid were measured automatically. A multivariate analysis was conducted to determine correlations between CTs in the foveal and parafoveal regions and retinal layers. Altogether, 144 eyes from 144 subjects (29 men, 115 women; mean age 41 years) were studied. The mean foveal CT was 282.413.8m. It was thicker in the temporal fovea than in the nasal fovea (p<0.001) and thicker in men than in women. Multivariate analysis showed that age and sex were significantly negatively correlated with the thickness of the retina, ganglion cell layer, outer retinal layer, and choroid but not of the nerve fiber layer. Regression analysis revealed that the CT decreased approximately 1.5m per year. Age and sex significantly influence choroidal thickness. Macular CT in a healthy eye thins with age. CT decreases with age faster at distances away from the foveal center than at the center. Subfoveal CT was greater than the mean CT. Parafoveal CT should be evaluated to identify specific retinal-choroidal disease. "
International Society for Companion Animal Infectious Diseases (ISCAID) guidelines for the diagnosis and management of bacterial urinary tract infections in dogs and cats.,"Recombinant Adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) are an attractive vector for gene therapy delivery which may be blocked by AAV neutralising antibodies (NAbs). As Type 1 Diabetes (T1DM) is an endocrine disease of immunological origin, it is likely that NAb profiles are altered in the disease. In this study NAb to AAV2, AAV5, AAV6, and AAV8 in 72 subjects with T1DM and 45 non-diabetic patients were measured over a 4-year follow-up period. AAV2 NAb titres were significantly lower in non-diabetic subjects (P=0.036). The T1DM group had more AAV8 NAb activity at baseline (P=0.019), whilst after 4 years follow-up the T1DM group displayed developed increased AAV 5 (P=0.03), 6 (P=0.03) and 8 (P=0.002) activity relative to the control group, however, overall AAV5 and 8 NAb levels were very low in patients <40. AAV NAb titre activity and prevalence generally appears higher in T1DM, however, low levels of AAV 5 and 8, particular in younger adult age groups at which T1DM can be targeted, could make these attractive vectors to target the disease.

Simultaneous delivery of gene and chemotherapeutics via copolymeric micellar nanoparticles to overcome multiple drug resistance to promote synergistic tumor suppression.,"Standard corneal collagen crosslinking (S-CXL) is a safe, approved procedure, but it may result in severe pain, early vision loss and possible complications, such as infectious or sterile keratitis, in some cases. We describe four cases of sterile infiltrates after uneventful S-CXL for keratoconus, from diagnosis to medical management with six months of follow-up, reporting their pathophysiological features, and comparing our findings with published reports. We discuss various possibilities for diagnosing sterile infiltration more rapidly. In terms of the pathophysiology of sterile infiltrate formation, we separated our patients into two types, one with sterile infiltrate from an antigen reaction and the other with sterile infiltrate due to excessive scarring. Early local steroid treatment resulted in a good visual outcome in our cases. "
Pulse Pressure is a Stronger Predictor Than Systolic Blood Pressure for Severe Eye Diseases in Diabetes Mellitus.,"The management of A or V pattern deviation associated with esotropia can be challenging since the horizontal deviation changes with position of gaze. This study aimed to assess the effect of unilateral horizontal rectus surgery for the correction of horizontal deviation associated with A or V pattern in children with non-comitant infantile esotropia. Twenty-seven children with infantile esotropia and A-V pattern, more than 10 and 15 prism diopters respectively, were included in this retrospective observational single-center study. Horizontal rectus surgery was performed on the most deviated eye under general anesthesia. The patients were divided into two groups: A pattern and V pattern. The outcome measures were change in the amount of pattern and rate of regression after surgery. The amount of pattern was characterized by the difference in esodeviation between upgaze and downgaze. Horizontal deviation at distance and near fixation decreased significantly (P<0.0001). Vertical gaze esotropia disparity decreased significantly (P=0.01 and P=0.0002 for A and V patterns respectively). A pattern esotropia was reported in only 2 (7%) cases after surgery compared to 9 (33%) before surgery. The number of subjects with V pattern esotropia decreased from 18 (67%) to 3 (11%) after surgery. The mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of A and V patterns may not always be related to oblique muscle dysfunction. These findings suggest that unilateral horizontal rectus surgery may be an effective procedure to correct both horizontal deviation and A-V pattern in non-comitant infantile esotropia. "
Tectonic keratoplasty using femtosecond laser lenticule in pediatric patients with corneal perforation secondary to blepharokeratoconjunctivitis: a case report and literature review.,"Chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia (CPEO) is a frequent clinical manifestation of disorders caused by pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations. However, for diagnostic purposes skeletal muscle tissue is used, since extraocular muscle tissue is usually not available for work-up. In the present study we aimed to identify causative factors that are responsible for extraocular muscle to be primarily affected in CPEO. We performed comparative histochemical and molecular genetic analyses of extraocular muscle and skeletal muscle single fibers in a case of isolated CPEO caused by the heteroplasmic m.5667G>A mutation in the mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> gene (MT-TN). Histochemical analyses revealed higher proportion of cytochrome c oxidase deficient fibers in extraocular muscle (41%) compared to skeletal muscle (10%). However, genetic analyses of single fibers revealed no significant difference either in the mutation loads between extraocular muscle and skeletal muscle cytochrome c oxidase deficient single fibers (extraocular muscle 86%4.6%; skeletal muscle 87.8%5.7%, p=0.246) nor in the mutation threshold (extraocular muscle 74%3%; skeletal muscle 74%4%). We hypothesize that higher proportion of cytochrome c oxidase deficient fibers in extraocular muscle compared to skeletal muscle might be due to facilitated segregation of the m.5667G>A mutation into extraocular muscle, which may explain the preferential ocular manifestation and clinically isolated CPEO.

Interaction between XRCC 1 gene polymorphisms and diabetes on susceptibility to primary open-angle glaucoma.,"Objective To evaluate the optic nerve impairment using MRI histogram texture analysis in the patients with optic neuritis.Methods The study included 60 patients with optic neuritis and 20 normal controls. The coronal T2 weighted imaging (T2WI) with fat saturation and enhanced T1 weighted imaging (T1WI) were performed to evaluate the optic nerve. MRI histogram texture features of the involved optic nerve were measured on the corresponding coronal T2WI images. The normal optic nerve (NON) was measured in the posterior 1/3 parts of the optic nerve. Kruskal-Wallis one-way ANOVA was used to compare the difference of texture features and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to evaluate the diagnostic value of texture features for the optic nerve impairment among the affected optic nerve with enhancement (ONwEN), affected optic nerve without enhancement (ONwoEN), contralateral normal appearing optic nerve (NAON) and NON.Results The histogram texture Energy and Entropy presented significant differences for ONwEN vs. ONwoEN (both P=0.000), ONwEN vs. NON (both P=0.000) and NAON vs. NON (both P<0.05). ROC analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of histogram texture Energy were 0.758, 0.795 and 0.701 for ONwEN vs. ONwoEN, ONwEN vs. NON and NAON vs. NON, AUC of Entropy were 0.758, 0.795 and 0.707 for ONwEN vs. ONwoEN, ONwEN vs. NON and NAON vs. NON.Conclusions The altered MRI histogram texture Energy and Entropy could be considered as a surrogate for MRI enhancement to evaluate the involved optic nerve and normal-appearing optic nerve in optic neuritis.

Arbutin attenuates hydrogen peroxide-induced oxidative injury through regulation of microRNA-29a in retinal ganglion cells.,"A Fe-FeO/rGO nanocomposite with heterostructure has been successfully synthesized by a highyield, low-cost, and easily operated room-temperature reduction method. The novel Fe-FeO/rGO composite exhibits an excellent activity for the degradation of Orange II under visible light by the Photo-Fenton process, which is 92.06% after 180 minutes. Moreover, magnetic analysis indicated that the prepared Fe-FeO/rGO composite possesses ferromagnetic properties, which enable it to be magnetically separated for recycling purposes. "
Examination of Kynurenine Toxicity on Corneal and Conjunctival Epithelium: In vitro and in vivo Studies.,"Small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) and femtosecond laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (FS-LASIK) are frequently used to treat myopia. However, little is known about the impact on recovery of these approaches in the very early postsurgical phase (within 24h). To compare the efficacy of these two procedures for the treatment of myopia in the early phase after surgery, differences in visual acuity, OSI (objective scattering index), cutoff for modulation transfer function (MTF), and SR (Strehl ratio) between SMILE and FS-LASIK were evaluated at 0, 2, 4 and 24h postoperatively using two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). No significant differences between SMILE and FS-LASIK in the MTF cutoff and SR were found (p>0.05). However, at 2h and 4h after surgery, OSI values in the SMILE group were significantly higher than those in the FS-LASIK group, and visual acuity scores in the SMILE group were significantly poorer than those in the FS-LASIK group (p<0.05). Regarding subjective symptoms, the number of patients complaining of eye dryness, blurred vision, foreign body sensation and eye soreness in the SMILE group were lower than the number in the FS-LASIK group. In conclusion, visual and optical quality outcomes of FS-LASIK for myopia were better than those of SMILE in the very early phase after surgery, a difference that is attributable to the formation of interface haze.

Hypoxia-induced disruption of neural vascular barrier is mediated by the intracellular induction of Fe(II) ion.,"The evidence on diagnostic test accuracy (DTA) of diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening utilising photographic studies by non-ophthalmologist personnel in low and middle-income country (LMIC) settings is scarce. We aimed to assess DTA of DR screening using a nonmydriatic hand-held digital camera by trained general physicians in a non-ophthalmic setting. This study is a validation of a screening intervention. We selected 700 people with diabetes (PwDM)>18years of age, not previously screened or treated for DR, presenting at a tertiary medical clinic in Sri Lanka. Two-field retinal imaging was used to capture fundus images before and after pupil dilatation, using a hand-held non-mydriatic (Visuscout 100-Germany) digital retinal camera. The images were captured and graded by two trained, masked independent physician graders. The DTA of different levels of DR was assessed comparing physician's grading with a retinologist's clinical examination by mydriatic bio-microscopy, according to a locally adopted guideline. Seven hundred eligible PwDM were screened by physician graders. The mean age of participants was 60.8years (SD 10.08) and mean duration of DM was 9.9years (SD 8.09). Ungradable image proportion in non-mydriatic imaging was 43.4% (either eye-31.3%, both eyes 12.1%). This decreased to 12.8% (either eye-11.6%, both eyes-1.2%) following pupil dilatation. In comparison to detection of any level of DR, a referable level DR (moderate non-proliferative DR and levels above) showed a higher level of DTA. The sensitivity of the defined referable DR was 88.7% (95% CI 81.7-93.8%) for grader 1 (positive predictive value [PPV] 59.1%) and 92.5% (95% CI 86.4-96.5%) for grader 2 (PPV 68%), using mydriatic imaging, after including ungradable images as screen positives. The specificity was 94.9% (95% CI 93.6-96.0%) for grader 1 (negative predictive value [NPV] 99%) and 96.4% (95% CI 95.3-97.3%) for grader 2 (NPV 99.4%). The Physicians grading of images from a digital hand-held non-mydriatic camera at a medical clinic, with dilatation of pupil of those who have ungradable images, provides a valid modality to identify referable level of DR. This could be a feasible alternative modality to the existing opportunistic screening to improve the access and coverage. Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN47559703 . Date of Registration 18th March 2019, Retrospectively registered. "
Optic nerve involvement in ocular toxoplasmosis: 12 year data from a tertiary referral center in Turkey.,"Reports on autosomal recessive optic atrophy (arOA) are sparse and so far, only one gene has been specifically associated with non-syndromic arOA, namely TMEM126A. To date, all reports of pathogenic TMEM126A variants are from affected individuals of Maghrebian origin, who all carry an identical nonsense variant. Here we report two novel variants in the TMEM126A gene from non-Maghreb individuals, both found in affected individuals with an arOA phenotype. We report three affected individuals from two families. The proband of family A, a 24-year-old Turkish woman, was diagnosed with visual loss in early childhood but a diagnosis of optic atrophy was only made at 14years. A diagnostic gene panel revealed a splice donor variant (c.86+2T>C) in homozygous state in the TMEM126A gene. Analysis of this variant based on RNA from whole blood revealed a single aberrant transcript lacking exon 2, presumably representing a functional null allele. Two siblings from family B, a 16-year old Iraqi girl and her 14-year old brother, were diagnosed with optic atrophy in early childhood. A missense variant p.(S36L) in the TMEM126A gene was identified in homozygous state in a gene panel-based diagnostic setting in both siblings. This missense variant is ultra rare in the general population, affects a highly evolutionarily conserved amino acid and segregates with the disease within the family. The three probands reported in this study had a relatively mild clinical course without any evidence of a syndromic (e.g. neurological) comorbidity, which is in line with previous studies. We provide additional evidence for the implication of biallelic pathogenic TMEM126A variants in arOA. Our findings extend both the mutational spectrum and geographic presence of TMEM126A in arOA. Screening of the entire gene should be considered in affected individuals presenting with features resembling arOA and also from non-Maghrebian descent. "
Complications in the first 10 phacoemulsification cataract surgeries with and without prior simulator training.,"Trisomy 21, also known as Down syndrome (DS), is the most common trisomy worldwide. Although ocular associations have been reported, retinal anatomy and pathology remain uninvestigated. We evaluate the role of spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in analyzing foveal morphology of children with DS. Nineteen consecutive DS children and eight controls were enrolled under a cross-sectional study in an institutional practice. All subjects underwent SD-OCT imaging on a hand-held device. The morphology and thickness of central fovea, inner retinal layers, outer retina, and photoreceptor layers were measured and compared with age-group sub-analysis. Mean age of the cases was 24 months (3-78 months). All cases and controls had a normal fundus on ophthalmoscopy and foveal thickness was comparable (p = 0.718). Inner retinal fusion was complete in the foveal center in only three eyes (15.8%) of cases compared to all eyes (100%) of controls (p < 0.001). The outer plexiform layer was normal in 10 eyes of cases (52.6%) compared to all eyes (100%) of the controls. Only 10 eyes of DS (52.6%) had a normal external limiting membrane, compared to all eyes of controls (100%, p = 0.01). The interdigitation zone (outer segment) was normal in one (5.3%) case compared to eight (67%) controls (p = 0.001). On subgroup analysis, in older cohorts, cases had a greater proportion of abnormal layers compared to controls. Visual acuity was found to be lower in cases when compared to controls, although not significant (p = 0.19). DS babies have abnormal foveal morphology and persistence of inner retinal layers. This may assist our understanding of their visual development. "
Ocular surface evaluation in pediatric Hashimoto's thyroiditis without thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy.,"The main inconvenience of conventional eye drops is the rapid washout of the drugs due to nasolacrimal drainage or ophthalmic barriers. The ocular drug bioavailability can be improved by either prolonging retention time in the cul-de-sac or by increasing the ocular permeability. The focus of this review is to highlight some chitosan-based drug delivery approaches that proved to have good clinical efficacy and high potential for use in ophthalmology. They are exemplified by recent studies exploring in-depth the techniques and mechanisms in order to improve ocular bioavailability of the active substances. Used alone or in combination with other compounds with synergistic action, chitosan enables ocular retention time and corneal permeability. Associated with other stimuli-responsive polymers, it enhances the mechanical strength of the gels. Chitosan and its derivatives increase drug permeability through the cornea by temporarily opening tight junctions between epithelial cells. Different types of chitosan-based colloidal systems have the potential to overcome the ocular barriers without disturbing the vision process. Chitosan also plays a key role in improving corneal wound healing by stimulating the migration of keratinocytes when it is used alone or in combination with other compounds with synergistic action.

Intravitreal neurodegenerative and inflammatory mediators in proliferative diabetic retinopathy.,"Since its first isolation in 1934, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been studied across a variety of research areas. This unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units of <i>N</i>-acetyl-d-glucosamine and d-glucuronic acid is almost ubiquitous in humans and in other vertebrates. HA is involved in many key processes, including cell signaling, wound reparation, tissue regeneration, morphogenesis, matrix organization and pathobiology, and has unique physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesivity, hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity. For these reasons, exogenous HA has been investigated as a drug delivery system and treatment in cancer, ophthalmology, arthrology, pneumology, rhinology, urology, aesthetic medicine and cosmetics. To improve and customize its properties and applications, HA can be subjected to chemical modifications: conjugation and crosslinking. The present review gives an overview regarding HA, describing its history, physico-chemical, structural and hydrodynamic properties and biology (occurrence, biosynthesis (by hyaluronan synthases), degradation (by hyaluronidases and oxidative stress), roles, mechanisms of action and receptors). Furthermore, both conventional and recently emerging methods developed for the industrial production of HA and its chemical derivatization are presented. Finally, the medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications of HA and its derivatives are reviewed, reporting examples of HA-based products that currently are on the market or are undergoing further investigations.

Evaluation of corneal layers and anterior sclera in patients with primary Sjgren's syndrome.,"To investigate anatomical/functional changes after oral eplerenone therapy for chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (CCSC) in successfully treated eyes and fellow eyes and assess timing of foveal subretinal fluid (SRF) resolution. Twenty-one eyes of 21 patients suffering from CCSC with monolateral foveal SRF successfully treated with oral eplerenone were enrolled in this retrospective study (group 1). The fellow eyes (21 eyes; group 2), healthy or affected by CCSC, without foveal SRF were considered in the analysis. A control healthy group was enrolled as well (healthy controls; <i>n</i> = 21). Main outcome measures during follow-up included changes of best corrected visual acuity (BCVA, logMAR), central macular thickness (CMT; m), SRF (m), subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT; m), superficial capillary plexus density (SCPD, %), deep capillary plexus density (DCPD, %), and choriocapillaris density (CCD, %) and percentage of eyes showing foveal SRF resolution at different time points. Functional and anatomical parameters significantly improved during the study in group 1. BCVA increased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001), while CMT, SFCT, and SRF decreased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001; <i>p</i> < 0.001, and <i>p</i> = 0.037, respectively). SCPD, DCPD, and CCD did not show any statistically significant difference during follow-up. In 71.4% of eyes, resolution of SRF was observed within 60 days and in the remaining 28.6%, at 120 days. In fellow eyes, SFCT decreased significantly (<i>p</i> < 0.001), whilst all other parameters did not modify. Eplerenone treatment in chronic CSCR potentially improves recovery of retinal and choroidal morphology as well as visual acuity gain. A complete resolution of foveal SRF was observed in all eyes during a 4-month follow-up, with most eyes healing at 2 months. "
Diagnostic value of pediatric blood culture bottles for acute postoperative endophthalmitis.,"Enhanced S-cone syndrome (ESCS) is caused by recessive mutations in the photoreceptor cell transcription factor <i>NR2E3</i>. Loss of <i>NR2E3</i> is characterized by repression of rod photoreceptor cell gene expression, over-expansion of the S-cone photoreceptor cell population, and varying degrees of M- and L-cone photoreceptor cell development. In this study, we developed a CRISPR-based homology-directed repair strategy and corrected two different disease-causing <i>NR2E3</i> mutations in patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) generated from two affected individuals. In addition, one patient's iPSCs were differentiated into retinal cells and <i>NR2E3</i> transcription was evaluated in CRISPR corrected and uncorrected clones. The patient's c.119-2A>C mutation caused the inclusion of a portion of intron 1, the creation of a frame shift, and generation of a premature stop codon. In summary, we used a single set of CRISPR reagents to correct different mutations in iPSCs generated from two individuals with ESCS. In doing so we demonstrate the advantage of using retinal cells derived from affected patients over artificial in vitro model systems when attempting to demonstrate pathophysiologic mechanisms of specific mutations.

Genetic correlation between Prothrombin G20210A polymorphism and retinal vein occlusion risk.,"The aim of the present study was to evaluate the risk of developing keratopathy in patients with surgery-indicated chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) via the National Health Insurance Research Database in Taiwan. Patients with a diagnostic code of CRS and who received functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) were considered to have surgery-indicated CRS. The exclusion criteria were legal blindness, an ocular tumor, eyeball removal or previous keratopathy, and each individual in the study group was matched to four non-CRS patients by age and sex. The outcome was set as the occurrence of keratopathy according to the diagnostic codes after the index date. Cox proportional hazard regression was used for statistical analysis. A total of 6053 patients with surgery-indicated CRS and another 24,212 non-CRS individuals were enrolled after exclusions. The age and sex distributions were identical between the two groups due to matching, while comorbidities, including hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and other cardiovascular disorders, were significantly higher in the study group. There were 231 episodes of keratopathy in the study group, and 695 episodes of keratopathy in the control group after the index date, for which study group showed a significantly higher rate of developing keratopathy with an adjusted hazard ratio of 1.208 and a higher cumulative probability. In subgroup analysis, female sex with surgery-indicated CRS showed a significantly greater risk of developing keratopathy. In conclusion, surgery-indicated CRS that needs FESS to relieve symptoms is a potential risk factor for keratopathy. "
Five-year follow-up of secondary iris-claw intraocular lens implantation for the treatment of aphakia: Anterior chamber versus retropupillary implantation.,"Glaucoma is a multifactorial neurodegenerative disease that causes impaired vision, and in advanced cases, blindness. The increasing prevalence of glaucoma due to an aging population has necessitated the identification of suitable biomarkers for the early detection of the disease. Aqueous humour (AH) has been proposed as a source of biomarkers, but it can only be collected using a minor, yet invasive surgical intervention. Tears, however, are constantly available and can be collected any time via non-invasive methods. In order to examine the utility of tear as a surrogate for aqueous humour in biomarker development, we compared the levels of 27 cytokines and chemokines in paired samples of tear and aqueous humour using a Luminex multiplex immunobead-based technique. Significantly higher levels of cytokines in tear compared to aqueous humour were detected suggesting that tear and aqueous humor are not identical in terms of inflammation response. Furthermore, the levels of IFN-, GM-CSF and IL-5 in tear were significantly lower in patients who developed complications after one year, but no statistically significant changes in cytokine levels were observed in aqueous humour. These three molecules may have potential as predictive biomarkers for the appearance of late flap-related complications of trabeculectomy. "
Berberine Accelerates Odontoblast Differentiation by Wnt/-Catenin Activation.,"Oxidative stress and a disturbed cellular protein homeostasis (proteostasis) belong to the most important hallmarks of aging and of neurodegenerative disorders. The proteasomal and autophagic-lysosomal degradation pathways are key measures to maintain proteostasis. Here, we report that hippocampal cells selected for full adaptation and resistance to oxidative stress induced by hydrogen peroxide (oxidative stress-resistant cells, OxSR cells) showed a massive increase in the expression of components of the cellular autophagic-lysosomal network and a significantly higher overall autophagic activity. A comparative expression analysis revealed that distinct key regulators of autophagy are upregulated in OxSR cells. The observed adaptive autophagic response was found to be independent of the upstream autophagy regulator mTOR but is accompanied by a significant upregulation of further downstream components of the canonical autophagy network such as Beclin1, WIPI1 and the transmembrane ATG9 proteins. Interestingly, the expression of the HSP70 co-chaperone BAG3, mediator of BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy and highly relevant for the clearance of aggregated proteins in cells, was found to be increased in OxSR cells that were consequently able to effectively overcome proteotoxic stress. Overexpression of BAG3 in oxidative stress-sensitive HT22 wildtype cells partly established the vesicular phenotype and the enhanced autophagic flux seen in OxSR cells suggesting that BAG3 takes over an important part in the adaptation process. A full proteome analysis demonstrated additional changes in the expression of mitochondrial proteins, metabolic enzymes and different pathway regulators in OxSR cells as consequence of the adaptation to oxidative stress in addition to autophagy-related proteins. Taken together, this analysis revealed a wide variety of pathways and players that act as adaptive response to chronic redox stress in neuronal cells. "
Combining SRET<sup>2</sup> and BiFC to Study GPCR Heteromerization and Protein-Protein Interactions.,"A 10-year-old boy was referred for a circumscribed choroidal hemangioma with underlying exudative detachment of the left eye. To avoid general anesthetics required for laser-based therapy in a child, we began a trial of oral propranolol. The patient's exudative detachment resolved, with resulting improvement in visual acuity, and remained quiescent for 3 years. "
Real-Life Evidence for Using a Treat-and-Extend Injection Regime for Patients with Central Retinal Vein Occlusion.,"With no safe and efficient approved therapy available for treating corneal neovascularization, the search for alternative and effective treatments is of great importance. Since the discovery of miRNAs as key regulators of gene expression, knowledge of their function in the eye has expanded continuously, facilitated by high throughput genomic tools such as microarrays and RNA sequencing. Recently, reports have emerged implicating miRNAs in pathological and developmental angiogenesis. This has led to the idea of targeting these regulatory molecules as a therapeutic approach for treating corneal neovascularization. With the growing volume of data generated from high throughput tools applied to study corneal neovascularization, we provide here a focused review of the known miRNAs related to corneal neovascularization, while presenting new experimental data and insights for future research and therapy development.

"Long-Term Intravital Imaging of the Cornea, Skin, and Hair Follicle by Multiphoton Microscope.","To characterize the clinical features of Sympathetic ophthalmia (SO) and make a comparison between SO and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease in Chinese patients. Retrospective case series. A total of 131 consecutive SO and 500 VKH patients randomly selected out of those referred to our uveitis center from April 2008 to June 2018. The history, extraocular and ocular findings, best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), auxiliary examination findings, complications and therapeutic effects were analyzed retrospectively in SO and VKH patients. SO manifested as posterior uveitis (68.8%) within 2 weeks and equal involvement of anterior and posterior segment (44.4%) respectively was observed between 2 weeks to 2 months after disease onset. Two months after disease onset, SO patients showed sunset glow fundus (51.2%) and granulomatous anterior uveitis (27.3%). VKH patients mainly showed posterior uveitis (100%), anterior segment involvement (92.4%) associated with posterior uveitis (84.9%), granulomatous anterior uveitis (97.4%) accompanying sunset glow fundus (91.5%) in the three time periods mentioned above. The frequencies of extraocular manifestations were lower in SO patients (24.4%) as compared to VKH patients (84.8%) (p<0.001). BCVA (LogMAR) of SO patients was improved from 0.680.86 to 0.470.78 (p=0.01), and BCVA of VKH patients was improved from 0.670.79 to 0.240.53 (p<0.001) at 12 months of follow-up. A worse BCVA was noted in SO patients compared with VKH patients after treatment (p=0.003). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed that the risk of loss of useful vision in SO patients was significantly higher than that of VKH patients (p<0.001). Chinese SO and VKH patients have a different evolutionary process. The frequency of extraocular manifestations in SO patients is much lower as compared to VKH patients. Visual outcome is worse in SO as compared to VKH. "
Occupational Vision Loss Following Alexandrite Laser Exposure.,"To describe the use of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) to quantitatively monitor the conjunctival graft revascularization after pterygium excision and conjunctival autograft (CAG) transplantation. Prospective, interventional case series. Ten patients undergoing pterygium excision and femtosecond laser-assisted CAG transplantation were included. OCTA was performed at 1 week, 1 and 3 months postoperatively at the CAG transplantation site and harvested area. The vessel density at three different depths: conjunctival epithelium or CAG epithelium, conjunctival stroma or CAG stroma, and episclera, was evaluated and quantified. The revascularization rate was assessed and correlated with the postoperative CAG thickness. No intraoperative and postoperative complications occurred. Reperfusion of the CAGs was observed at 1 week, and early reperfusion within the first month accounted for more than half of graft revascularization. The vessel regrowth density was 9.62.6 % and 11.12.8 % between 1 week and 1 month, and was 9.81.8 % and 11.91.9 % between 1 and 3 months, at the CAG and underlying episcleral levels, respectively. All the CAGs were well-perfused at 3 months. The vessel regrowth density was significantly and strongly correlated with the changes of CAG thickness in a negative relationship (=-0.94, P=0.019). At the harvested site, the vascular network of episclera was not affected, and the conjunctival vascularization was restored at 1 month. OCTA is a promising tool to evaluate the vascularization or revascularization of conjunctiva, conjunctival graft and episclera, in a quantitative and serial manner, helping in diseases diagnosis and treatment monitoring. The graft revascularization rate was predictive of postoperative graft deswelling. "
Multimodal Imaging Report of Crystalline Keratopathy in Relapsing Polychondritis.,"To determine the association of aqueous humor cytokine concentrations with long-term treatment response to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents in diabetic macular edema (DME). Retrospective case series. Pooled data of aqueous humor cytokine concentrations collected at baseline and 2-month follow-up (2 injections) for treatment-nave eyes with center-involving DME previously enrolled in a prospective study were reviewed. Subjects receiving intravitreal anti-VEGF injections outside of study protocol as per standard of care were classified into Responders versus Non-responders based on qualitative assessment of optical coherence tomography for persistence of DME at longitudinal follow-up visits. Of the 41 eyes, 85% were classified as Responders with a significant decline in baseline central subfield thickness and macular volume (p's < 0.001), and 15% were identified as Non-responders to anti-VEGF therapy over 51.418.7 months of follow-up. No significant difference in baseline aqueous humor VEGF concentration was noted, while at 2-month follow-up, the Non-responder group had a significantly higher VEGF concentration compared to the Responder group (451.5690.9pg/ml versus 113.7211.4pg/ml; p = 0.02). The Responder group also demonstrated a significant decline from baseline to 2-month follow-up in concentration of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (p < 0.001), interleukin-10 (p = 0.041), monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (p = 0.046), placental growth factor (p = 0.027), and transforming growth factor-2 (p = 0.017). Aqueous humor cytokine concentrations serve as an early biomarker for long-term response to anti-VEGF therapy, and may enable more effective treatment regimens that improve anatomical outcomes in eyes with DME.

Ectopic Ocular Surface Calcification in Patients With Hypophosphatasia Treated With Asfotase Alfa.,"To classify retinal nonperfusion regions (NPR) in patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and assess the relationship with severity of DME. Prospective, observational case series. Forty eyes of 29 patients with treatment-nave center-involved macular edema secondary to diabetes mellitus were included (The DAVE study, NCT01552408) in this analysis. Ultra-widefield fluorescein angiography (UWF FA) images were transmitted to the Doheny Image Reading Center, where they were corrected using stereographic projection to adjust for peripheral distortion. Two independent, certified graders manually evaluated the NPR and classified the nonperfusion as being associated with leakage, or without leakage. The size of these two subtypes of NPR were computed in mm<sup>2</sup> and assessed across the entire retina and within three concentric retinal zones. The relationship between subtype of NPR and the severity of DME was assessed. In forty eyes with treatment-nave DME, visual acuity was significantly correlated with central macular thickness (CMT) and macular volume (MV). The NPR with leakage was positively correlated with CMT (R=0.408, P=0.009) and MV (R=0.399, P=0.011), whereas the NPR without leakage was negatively correlated with CMT (R=-0.468, P=0.002) and MV (R=-0.473, P=0.002). The NPR with leakage in the posterior region was significantly greater compared to the mid-periphery and the far-periphery (P<0.001), whereas the NPR without leakage was significantly greater in the mid-periphery compared to the far-periphery or the posterior region (P=0.001). In patients with DME, the severity of DME appears to be positively correlated with NPR with leakage, but negatively correlated with NPR without leakage. These findings may have implications for the pathophysiology of DME and the design of protocols for targeted laser in these eyes. "
Bilateral Punctal Foreign Body Granulomas Secondary to Multiple Retained Punctal Plugs.,"To investigate the relationship between glucose tolerance levels and the circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (cpRNFLT) in a general Japanese population. Population-based, cross-sectional study. In 2012 and 2013, a total of 2,809 Japanese community-dwellers aged 40-79 years in the Hisayama Study underwent eye examinations including cpRNFLT measurement with spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Of these, 1,324 subjects (578 men, 746 women) were enrolled. Glucose tolerance levels were determined by a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. We conducted an analysis of covariance to estimate the mean values of cpRNFLT according to the subjects' glucose intolerance status. The subjects with prediabetes or with diabetes mellitus had significantly lower age- and sex-adjusted mean cpRNFLT values than those with normal glucose tolerance (p=.04, p=.0004, respectively). The age- and sex-adjusted mean values of cpRNFLT decreased significantly with elevating fasting plasma glucose and 2-hr postload glucose levels (all p for trend <.05). These associations were substantially unchanged after adjustment for potential confounding factors. The coexistence of poorer glucose tolerance and higher intraocular pressure levels was additively associated with thinner cpRNFLT. Our analyses revealed that poorer glucose tolerance was significantly associated with the reduction of cpRNFLT in a Japanese general population, suggesting that the loss of neural tissue in the eye begins at the pre-diabetic stage, and that hyperglycemia may play a role in the reduction of cpRNFLT. "
Lower Eyelid Distraction Test: New Insights on the Reference Value.,"To investigate association between the development of retinal vein occlusion (RVO) and blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). A retrospective, nationwide, population-based cohort study. Republic of Korea STUDY POPULATION: This study included 23,149,403 people aged 20 years or older who underwent the Korean National Health Screening Program examination between January 2009 and December 2012. Among them, the RVO group was composed of patients with an initial diagnosis of RVO made between 2009 and 2015 (n=117,639). The earliest claim with an RVO diagnostic code was considered as the incident time. The predictive value of HDL-C level for RVO was analyzed using hazard ratios (HRs). Incident cases of RVO. The subjects with RVO were generally older; had high body mass index, waist circumference, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglyceride values and low glomerular filtration rate and HDL-C values; and were more likely to experience diabetes mellitus (DM) and hypertension in comparison with the non-RVO group. The fully-adjusted HR of RVO was 1.12 (95% CI: 1.10-1.14) in the lowest quartile of HDL-C versus in the highest quartile. The association between the development of RVO and HDL-C was higher those with a younger age, male sex, current smoking habit, DM, and hypercholesterolemia. In addition, we observed a significant synergistic effect of low HDL-C level with obesity and hypertension. This is the first nationwide population-based epidemiologic study evaluating the association between HDL-C level and the risk of RVO development. A significant association between low HDL-C and RVO development was found. "
Benzalkonium Chloride Demonstrates Concentration-Dependent Antiviral Activity Against Adenovirus In Vitro.,"Abamectin (ABA) is one of the most widely used compounds in agriculture and veterinary medicine. However, the cytotoxicity of ABA in human gastric cells is utterly unknown. In this study, ABA suppressed the proliferation of MGC803 cells by arresting the cell cycle at the G0/G1-phase. Moreover, ABA induced mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis by inducingthe loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, upregulationof Bax/Bcl-2, and activation of caspase-3. ABA significantly improved the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio and reduced P62 protein expression in a dose-dependent manner. Through detection of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, we found ABA induced the accumulation of intracellular ROS and then reduced PI3K/AKT signaling activation relatedto MGC803 cellapoptosis and autophagy. Our results indicate that ABA exerts cytotoxic effects on human MGC803 cells through apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling. Furthermore, ABA may be a potential risk to human gastric health. "
The spectrum of intermediate SCN8A-related epilepsy.,"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an autoimmune CNS disorder mediated by pathogenic aquaporin-4 (AQP4) water channel autoantibodies (AQP4-IgG). Although AQP4-IgG-driven complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) is critical for the formation of NMO lesions, the molecular mechanisms governing optimal classical pathway activation are unknown. We investigated the molecular determinants driving CDC in NMO using recombinant AQP4-specific autoantibodies (AQP4 rAbs) derived from affected patients. We identified a group of AQP4 rAbs targeting a distinct extracellular loop C epitope that demonstrated enhanced CDC on target cells. Targeted mutations of AQP4 rAb Fc domains that enhance or diminish C1q binding or antibody Fc-Fc interactions showed that optimal CDC was driven by the assembly of multimeric rAb platforms that increase multivalent C1q binding and facilitate C1q activation. A peptide that blocks antibody Fc-Fc interaction inhibited CDC induced by AQP4 rAbs and polyclonal NMO patient sera. Super-resolution microscopy revealed that AQP4 rAbs with enhanced CDC preferentially formed organized clusters on supramolecular AQP4 orthogonal arrays, linking epitope-dependent multimeric assembly with enhanced C1q binding and activation. The resulting model of AQP4-IgG CDC provides a framework for understanding classical complement activation in human autoantibody-mediated disorders and identifies a potential new therapeutic avenue for treating NMO.

Left rostrolateral prefrontal cortex lesions reduce suicidal ideation in penetrating traumatic brain injury.,"The professions of law and medicine make an important contribution to society, applying complex theoretical and practical knowledge to serve their clients and patients. Given the significance of these professional roles, it is vital that doctors and lawyers are well-educated and prepared for the challenging situations that will confront them in their professional careers. This article examines and compares education in law and medicine in Australia, with a focus on learning methods, assessment and feedback, integrating case studies from teaching in evidence law and ophthalmology subjects. The article evaluates opportunities to improve education in both fields through a series of comparative observations. "
Widefield OCT angiography and ultra-widefield multimodal imaging of Susac syndrome.,"The objective analysis of eye movements has a significant history and has been long proven to be an important research tool in the setting of brain injury. Quantitative recordings have a strong capacity to screen diagnostically. Concurrent examinations of the eye and upper limb movements directed toward shared functional goals (e.g., eye-hand coordination) serve as an additional robust biomarker-laden path to capture and interrogate neural injury, including acquired brain injury (ABI). While quantitative dual-effector recordings in 3-D afford ample opportunities within ocular-manual motor investigations in the setting of ABI, the feasibility of such dual recordings for both eye and hand is challenging in pathological settings, particularly when approached with research-grade rigor. Here we describe the integration of an eye tracking system with a motion tracking system intended primarily for limb control research to study a natural behavior. The protocol enables the investigation of unrestricted, three-dimensional (3D) eye-hand coordination tasks. More specifically, we review a method to assess eye-hand coordination in visually guided saccade-to-reach tasks in subjects with chronic middle cerebral artery (MCA) stroke and compare them to healthy controls. Special attention is paid to the specific eye- and limb-tracking system properties in order to obtain high fidelity data from participants post-injury. Sampling rate, accuracy, permissible head movement range given anticipated tolerance and the feasibility of use were several of the critical properties considered when selecting an eye tracker and an approach. The limb tracker was selected based on a similar rubric but included the need for 3-D recording, dynamic interaction and a miniaturized physical footprint. The quantitative data provided by this method and the overall approach when executed correctly has tremendous potential to further refine our mechanistic understanding of eye-hand control and help inform feasible diagnostic and pragmatic interventions within the neurological and rehabilitative practice.

Anterior chamber aqueous flare is not a predictor for surgical closure of full-thickness idiopathic macular holes.,"Cataract surgery substantially improves patient quality of life. Despite the rising prevalence of dementia in the US, little is known about use of cataract surgery among this group. To evaluate the relationship between dementia status and cataract surgery. Using administrative insurance claims for a representative sample of 1,125,387 US Medicare beneficiaries who received eye care between 2006 and 2015, we compared cataract surgery rates between patients with and without dementia via multivariable regression models to adjust for patient characteristics. Main outcome measures were annual rates of cataract surgery and hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval (CI) for receiving cataract surgery. Cataract surgery was performed in 457,128 patients, 23,331 with a prior diagnosis of dementia. 16.7% of dementia patients underwent cataract surgery, compared to 43.8% of patients without dementia. 59 cataract surgeries were performed per 1000 dementia patients annually, versus 105 surgeries per 1000 nondementia patients. After adjusting for patient characteristics, dementia patients were approximately half as likely to receive cataract surgery compared to nondementia patients (adjusted HR=0.53, 95% CI 0.53-0.54). Among the subset of patients who received a first cataract surgery, those with dementia were also less likely to receive second-eye cataract surgery (adjusted HR=0.87, 95% CI 0.86-0.88). US Medicare patients with dementia are less likely to undergo cataract surgery than those without dementia. This finding has implications for quality of care and dementia progression. More information is necessary to understand why rates of cataract surgery are lower for these patients, and to identify conditions where benefits of surgery may outweigh risks. "
Aerobic exercise and Orexin A: role of sympathetic activity and redox system.,"Visual disorders like double vision, dry eyes, and visual field deficits are common but frequently missed in Parkinson's disease. Here, we aim to increase awareness for these visual disorders in Parkinson patients by discussing several common problems that can be easily diagnosed using comprehensive history taking and a basic neuro-ophthalmological examination. We offer practical guidance for the patient interview and physical exam that can facilitate a timelier recognition of visual disorders. Such recognition has immediate therapeutic relevance, because Parkinson patients are strongly dependent on an adequate vision, for example to optimally benefit from visual cueing strategies. "
Progression characteristics of ellipsoid zone loss in macular telangiectasia type 2.,"Intraocular pressure is regulated by mechanosensitive cells within the conventional outflow pathway, the primary route of aqueous humour drainage from the eye. However, the characteristics of the forces acting on those cells are poorly understood. We develop a model that describes flow through the conventional outflow pathway, including the trabecular meshwork (TM) and Schlemm's canal (SC). Accounting for the ocular pulse, we estimate the time-varying shear stress on SC endothelium and strain on the TM. We consider a range of outflow resistances spanning normotensive to hypertensive conditions. Over this range, the SC shear stress increases significantly and becomes highly oscillatory. TM strain also increases, but with negligible oscillations. Interestingly, TM strain responds more to changes in outflow resistance around physiological values, while SC shear stress responds more to elevated levels of resistance. A modest increase in TM stiffness, as observed in glaucoma, suppresses TM strain and practically eliminates the influence of outflow resistance on SC shear stress. As SC and TM cells respond to mechanical stimulation by secreting factors that modulate outflow resistance, our model provides insight regarding the potential role of SC shear and TM strain as mechanosensory cues for homeostatic regulation of outflow resistance and hence intraocular pressure. "
Reading deficits in diabetic patients treated with panretinal photocoagulation and good visual acuity.,"Mobius sequence is a rare disorder that results from underdevelopment of the sixth and seventh cranial nerves, with subsequent facial weakness and impairment of ocular abduction. Approximately half of the affected patients have esotropia with limitation of extraocular movements. This study retrospectively reviews the long-term outcome of strabismus surgery for such patients. The long-term follow-up results in five children with Mobius sequence, who were observed after strabismus surgery for congenital esotropia, were analyzed. All patients had a limitation of abduction in both eyes. Preoperative esotropia ranged from 20 to 30 prism diopters (PD) (mean 27 PD). Patient age at surgery ranged from 4.5 to 14 months. Bilateral medial rectus muscle recession was performed in all cases, ranging from 4.0 to 6.5 mm. Inferior transposition of the medial rectus muscles was performed in two patients for treatment of V-pattern, and two patients also had surgery for vertical strabismus. Follow-up ranged from 4 to 19.5 years (mean 11.7 years). The final horizontal alignment was <8 PD in all patients, and all demonstrated some binocularity. Bilateral medial rectus muscle recession is an effective treatment for esotropia associated with Mobius sequence, with good long-term stability. "
Cost-effectiveness analysis in a randomized trial of late in-the-bag intraocular lens dislocation surgery: repositioning versus exchange.,"Interface engineering has been recognized as one of the most promising strategies for regulating the physical and chemical properties of materials. However, constructing well-defined nanointerfaces with efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER) still remains a challenge. Herein, cross columnar NiTe nanoarrays supported on nickel foam are prepared. Subsequently, NiTe/NiS nanointerfaces are constructed by an ion-exchange process. Importantly, the electrocatalytic performance for the OER can be facilitated by coupling NiTe and NiS. As a result, NiTe/NiS shows excellent OER activity with an ultralow overpotential of only 257 mV at a current density of 100 mA cm<sup>-2</sup> , and a Tafel slope of 49 mV dec<sup>-1</sup> in 1.0 m KOH. The calculated and experimental results reveal that the strong electron interaction on nanointerfaces induces electronic structure modulation, which optimizes the binding energy of *OOH intermediates, thus improving the OER performance. "
Incidence of posterior capsule tears in bimanual versus single-piece irrigation and aspiration during cataract surgery.,"In relapse-onset multiple sclerosis (MS), tissue abnormality - as assessed with magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) imaging - is greater in the outer cortical and inner periventricular layers. The cause of this remains unknown but meningeal inflammation has been implicated, particularly lymphoid follicles, which are seen in secondary progressive (SP) but not primary progressive (PP) MS. Cortical and periventricular MTR gradients might, therefore, differ in PPMS and SPMS if these follicles are responsible. We assessed cortical and periventricular MTR gradients in PPMS, and compared gradients between people with PPMS and SPMS. Using an optimised processing pipeline, periventricular normal-appearing white matter and cortical grey-matter MTR gradients were compared between 51 healthy controls and 63 people with progressive MS (28 PPMS, 35 SPMS). The periventricular gradient was significantly shallower in healthy controls (0.122 percentage units (pu)/band) compared to PPMS (0.952 pu/band, p<0.0001) and SPMS (1.360 pu/band, p<0.0001). The cortical gradient was also significantly shallower in healthy controls (-2.860 pu/band) compared to PPMS (-3.214 pu/band, p=0.038) and SPMS (-3.328 pu/band, p=0.016). Abnormal periventricular and cortical MTR gradients occur in both PPMS and SPMS, suggesting comparable underlying pathological processes. "
Prognostic factors for visual acuity in patients with Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy after rAAV2-ND4 gene therapy.,"To evaluate the ophthalmic, systemic, and genetic characteristics of patients with Wolfram syndrome. In total, 13 patients with suspected or clinically diagnosed Wolfram syndrome underwent ophthalmic and systemic examinations and genetic analyses for Wolfram syndrome between August and October 2018. The mean age of the subjects was 24.27.1years, of which 5 (38.5%) subjects were male and 8 (61.5%) were female. The mean best-corrected visual acuity ranged from counting fingers to 20/40, with a mean of 20/250 (1.100.69 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). Dyschromatopsia was present in all patients (100%). There was a severe decrease in the average peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thicknesses (54.76.5 and 51.94.8m, respectively). Optical coherence tomography angiography showed significantly lower whole-image, inside disk, and peripapillary vessel densities in the patients with Wolfram syndrome than in the healthy controls (p<0.001 for all). All patients who underwent genetic analyses had mutations in the WFS1 gene. Moreover, two novel mutations, p.Met623Trpfs*2 (c.1867delA) and p.Arg611Profs*9 (c.1832_11847del16) at exon 8, were detected. The frequency of systemic findings was as follows: optic atrophy (100%), diabetes mellitus (92.3%), central diabetes insipidus (38.5%), sensorineural hearing loss (38.5%), and presence of urological (30.8%), psychiatric (30.8%), and neurological (23.1%) diseases. Wolfram syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that can be associated with severe ophthalmic and systemic abnormalities. All patients who present with unexplained optic atrophy should be evaluated for Wolfram syndrome, even if they do not have diabetes mellitus because optic atrophy can sometimes manifest before diabetes mellitus.

Editorial: Introduction to the Special Issue in Honour of Ray Guillery.,"Cerebral hemispherectomy is typically used to treat patients with pharmacoresistant epilepsy. Visual-related outcomes are relatively unstudied in this population, aside from the knowledge that patients develop a complete homonymous hemianopia contralateral to the side of the hemispherectomy. The purpose of this study was to determine and characterize parent-reported functional visual, oculomotor, and postural changes in a large population of patients following cerebral hemispherectomy. An online survey was sent to parents of children who had undergone hemispherectomy for seizure control. Families were recruited by the Brain Recovery Project: Childhood Epilepsy Surgery Foundation. Parent-reported subjective visual function was assessed by the presence of peripheral field defects, ocular misalignment and anomalous head posture. A total of 196 (12.5%) participants responded. Postoperative follow-up was 9278 months (range: 1-382). Ninety-three percent of parents reported the child had difficulties with peripheral vision. Torticollis was present postoperatively in 122 (62%) patients. Strabismus was noted in 93 (49%). Fifty-five (59%) of the strabismus patients demonstrated exotropia with the majority of exotropia patients demonstrating the exo-deviated eye in the direction contralateral to the hemispherectomy (74.5%). Both torticollis and strabismus were most frequently seen immediately after surgery. Sixty-six patients (34%) underwent strabismus treatment. Patients with younger age of seizure onset, younger age of surgery, and certain epilepsy etiologies (hemimegencephaly, Sturge-Weber syndrome) were more likely to develop strabismus and torticollis. Torticollis and strabismus are common after hemispherectomy and appear to be influenced by etiology and age at surgery. Preoperative discussion with parents and patients regarding those compensatory mechanisms is recommended, and postoperative ophthalmologic assessments are also encouraged. "
Photocoagulation for juxtapapillary retinal hemangioma in a young girl: A case report.,"To report baseline information for a medical university cohort with the aim of exploring related factors for adult myopic progression. This study included Chinese freshmen students from a medical school in Guangzhou, China. All participants underwent detailed eye examinations, including cycloplegic refraction, ocular biometry and swept source optical coherence tomography. Choroidal thickness (CT) measurements were performed at nine locations in the macular area. Eye care habits and physical activities were measured by questionnaire. The mean age of the study population (N=307) was 18.82.3 years, and 46.3% were male. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia was 92.8% and 21.1%, respectively. In emmetropia (spherical equivalent, SE -0.49D to +0.5D), mild to moderate myopia (SE -0.50D to -5.99D) and high myopia groups (SE <-6.00D), the average subfoveal CT was 300.362.1 m, 219.365.4 m and 194.059.7 m, respectively. In all eyes, the temporal CT was the thickest among all of the locations in the macular area, and the CT was thinnest nasally. Gender, axial length (AL), anterior chamber depth (ACD) and intraocular pressure (IOP) were the strongest related factors for subfoveal CT in mild to moderate myopia, while AL was the only significant determinant for subfoveal CT in highly myopic eyes. The prevalence of myopia was high in Chinese medical students. Macular CT was generally thinner in highly myopic eyes. Our study provided baseline information for the medical school cohort, including CT, AL, ACD, IOP and eye care habits. "
Cognitive Performance Concomitant With Vision Acuity Predicts 13-Year Risk for Mortality.,"The clinical sign trachomatous inflammation - follicular (TF) is used to monitor indication for and response to mass azithromycin distribution in trachoma-endemic communities. Here, we assess the relationship between TF, trachomatous inflammation - intense (TI), and infection with ocular Chlamydia trachomatis over time during annual mass azithromycin distribution. We used data from a cluster-randomized trial of mass azithromycin distribution for trachoma control in a mesoendemic region of Niger. This study includes 24 communities that received 3 years of annual mass azithromycin distribution. TF, TI, and ocular chlamydia infection were monitored among children aged 0-5 years. We assessed the correlation between the prevalence of ocular chlamydia infection and 1) TF and 2) TI prevalence over time. At baseline, ocular chlamydia prevalence was 21.2% (95% CI 14.3-28.1%), TF prevalence was 27.7% (95% CI 21.2-34.2%), and TI prevalence was 8.3% (95% CI 5.2-11.5%). The prevalence of all three measures decreased significantly over time (P < 0.001). At baseline, ocular chlamydia infection prevalence was strongly correlated with both TF (rho = 0.78, P < 0.0001) and TI (rho = 0.76, P < 0.0001). The correlation between ocular chlamydia infection and both TF and TI was weak at months 12 and 24. At 36 months, when TF prevalence had dropped below 10%, ocular chlamydia infection and TF were moderately correlated (rho = 0.70, P= 0.0002). Both TF and TI are good indicators of infection prevalence prior to mass azithromycin distribution. However, this relationship may be affected by repeated rounds of mass azithromycin distribution. "
MiR-21 promotes pterygium cell proliferation through the PTEN/AKT pathway.,"Ginsenosides Rb1 (Rb1) could form micelles in aqueous solutions. Self-assembled Rb1 micelles could potentially be utilized as ocular drug delivery system, and it was postulated that the encapsulation of a medicine within Rb1 micelles might strengthen the drug's therapeutic action and reduce side effects. Diclofenac-loaded Rb1 micelles (Rb1-Dic micelles) were formulated, optimized, and then further evaluated for in vitro cytotoxicity/in vivo ocular irritation, in vivo corneal permeation, and in vivo anti-inflammatory efficacy. Rb1 self-assembled into micelles with ultra-small particle size (<8nm) in a homogeneous distribution state (polydispersity index [PDI]<0.3). Diclofenac was highly encapsulated into the micelles according to the weight ratios of Rb1 to diclofenac. The ophthalmic solution of Rb1-Dic micelle was simple to prepare. Rb1 had good cellular tolerance, and it also improved the cellular tolerance of the encapsulated diclofenac. Rb1-Dic micelles also showed non-irritants to the rabbit eyes. The use of Rb1 micelles significantly improved the in vivo corneal permeation as well as the anti-inflammatory efficacy of diclofenac when compared to commercial diclofenac eye drops. Rb1 micelle formulations have great potential as a novel ocular drug delivery system to improve the bioavailability of drugs such as diclofenac. "
"ALPK1 missense pathogenic variant in five families leads to ROSAH syndrome, an ocular multisystem autosomal dominant disorder.","To assess incidence and risk factors of cataract extraction in patients with primary congenital glaucoma, surgical outcome, and complications. Retrospective cohort study, in which 108 patients with primary congenital glaucoma were included. Data collected were need for cataract extraction and at what age, intraocular pressure at diagnosis of primary congenital glaucoma, required antiglaucomatous surgeries, possible mutation in the CYP1B1 gene, and final visual acuity. Among the patients who required cataract extraction were visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and complications, evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively. The data were analysed with STATA. A total of 198 eyes of 108 patients were included, with a median follow-up of 8years (range: 5-53). In all, 32 eyes (16.2%) of 24 patients (22%) required cataract extraction. The median age for cataract extraction was 12.94years (interquartile range: 2.42-22). The main identified risk factors associated with cataract extraction were antiglaucomatous surgeries (hazard ratio 1.48, p<0.001) and valvular implant (hazard ratio 2.78, p<0.001). Lens was implanted in 30/32 eyes and the main complications were intraocular pressure decontrol ( n=13), capsular fibrosis ( n=7), corneal decompensation ( n=4), lens subluxation ( n=4), and endophthalmitis ( n=1). Visual acuity improvement was observed after cataract extraction in 66.67% of eyes. There is a high incidence of cataract surgery in patients with primary congenital glaucoma, but generally outside of pediatric age. A greater risk of cataract extraction was identified in those patients with a greater number of antiglaucomatous surgeries, especially after valvular implantation. Despite the high rate of complications related to cataract extraction in primary congenital glaucoma, good visual improvement was observed after surgery. "
Biotherapeutics and immunogenicity: ophthalmic perspective.,"The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of pupil cerclage and a new variant of sliding knot technique for repairing traumatic mydriasis. This is a observational case series study. A series of consecutive patients affected by traumatic permanent mydriasis who underwent pupil cerclage were recruited at the Department of Ophthalmology of the University of Padova, Italy. Best-corrected visual acuity, measured in logarithm of minimum angle of resolution (logMAR), and intraocular pressure at 1, 3, 6, and 12months were monitored. Postoperative pupil size and anterior chamber angle were measured. Postoperative cystoid macular edema (CME) and glaucoma were evaluated. Twelve patients were recruited. Phakic patients (7) underwent cataract surgery combined with pupil cerclage. Vitrectomy was performed in nine patients. Best-corrected visual acuity improved from 2.91.1 logMAR at baseline to 0.30.8 logMAR at 12th month. No significant difference between the preoperative and postoperative intraocular pressure was demonstrated. Mean pupil size at 12th month was 2.820.5mm with round shape. Anterior chamber angle mean was 474.5. Six patients developed a CME, and two patients a glaucoma. Pupil cerclage technique reestablishes the pupil with a precise regulation of the pupil size without distortion of its natural round shape. New sliding knot allows surgeon to reduce the risk of iatrogenic iris damage and to make a security permanent knot. "
Impact of systemic vascular risk factors on the choriocapillaris using optical coherence tomography angiography in patients with systemic hypertension.,"Alport syndrome is an inherited Type IV collagenopathy characterised by renal failure, hearing loss and ophthalmic manifestations such as lenticonus and dot-and-fleck retinopathy. New signs have been described which can be useful both for diagnosis and for prognosticating the risk of complications. This study examines and describes a triad comprising the unusual 'stair-case' foveal sign, together with choroidal thinning and late-stage peripheral schisis in a patient with Alport syndrome. This is a case report of a 49-year-old Caucasian male with a background of X-linked Alport syndrome presenting with gradual and progressive diminution of vision in the left eye with a central blur. He had already undergone three renal allografts, was deaf and suffered from hypertension by the time of his first presentation to ophthalmology. On examination, corrected visual acuity was 6/9.5 in the right eye and 6/30 in the left eye. Optical coherence tomography imaging showed an unusual 'stair-case' sign of the fovea in both eyes, together with choroidal thinning. We postulate that an abnormal vitreomacular interface followed by vitreomacular traction and eventually separation, removing layers of the inner retina with the vitreous, led to this unusual appearance. Subsequently, this patient also developed schitic changes more peripherally in the retina which progressed over the following 5years. The stair-case foveal sign, choroidal thinning and mid-peripheral schisis are three signs that clinicians might expect to encounter on optical coherence tomography imaging of patients with Alport syndrome. These findings can be attributed to unique mutations of collagen IV which lead to a variety of clinical phenotypes affecting basement membrane structures. Identification of these features may not only be useful diagnostically and in forecasting complications such as macular holes, but also predict mode of inheritance and likelihood of early-onset renal failure.

Donor-Dependent Factors Influencing Contamination Rates of Conjunctival Swabs of Human Donor Eyes.,"To perform a health economic analysis of an intervention designed to increase rates of vaginal birth after caesarean, compared with usual care. Economic analysis alongside the cluster-randomised OptiBIRTH trial (Optimising childbirth by increasing vaginal birth after caesarean section (VBAC) through enhanced women-centred care). Fifteen maternity units in three European countries - Germany (five), Ireland (five), and Italy (five) - with relatively low VBAC rates. Pregnant women with a history of one previous lower-segment caesarean section; sites were randomised (3:2) to intervention or control. A cost-utility analysis from both societal and health-services perspectives, using a decision tree. Costs and resource use per woman and infant were compared between the control and intervention group by country, from pregnancy recognition until 3months postpartum. Based on the caesarean section rates, and maternal and neonatal morbidities and mortality, the incremental cost-utility ratios were calculated per country. The mean difference in costs per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained from a societal perspective between the intervention and the control group, using a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, was: 263 (95%CI 258-268) and 0.008QALYs (95%CI 0.008-0.009QALYs) for Germany, 456 (95%CI 448-464) and 0.052QALYs (95%CI 0.051-0.053QALYs) for Ireland, and 1174 (95%CI 1170-1178) and 0.006QALYs (95%CI 0.005-0.007 QALYs) for Italy. The incremental cost-utility ratios were 33,741/QALY for Germany, 8785/QALY for Ireland, and 214,318/QALY for Italy, with a 51% probability of being cost-effective for Germany, 92% for Ireland, and 15% for Italy. The OptiBIRTH intervention was likely to be cost-effective in Ireland and Germany. The OptiBIRTH intervention (to increase VBAC rates) is likely to be cost-effective in Germany and Ireland. "
Comparison of cytokine/chemokine levels in aqueous humor of primary open-angle glaucoma patients with positive or negative outcome following trabeculectomy.,"We aimed to compare clinical and pathological reactions towards locally synthesized bovine bone derived from hydroxyapatite (bonedocosahexaenoic acid (dHA)) and commercially available porous polyethylene (Medpor, Porex SurgicalIncorporation, Georgia, USA) orbital implants in animal models. An experimental study was performed on 14 New Zealand white rabbits. Group A (n=7) was implanted with bovine bone dHA and group B (n=7) was implanted with Medpor. Clinical examinations were performed on Days 1, 7, 14, 28, and 42 post-implantation. The implanted eyes were enucleated on Day 42 and were sent for pathological evaluation. Serial clinical examinations included urine color and odor; feeding and physical activity demonstrated normal wellbeing in all the subjects. Localized minimal infection was observed in both groups during the first two weeks following implantation, and the subjects responded well to topical moxifloxacin. Both groups exhibited evidence of wound breakdown. No signs of implant migration or extrusion were observed in either group. The histopathological examination revealed no statistically significant difference in inflammatory cell reactions and fibrovascular tissue maturation between both types of implants. However, all (100%) of the bovine bone dHA implants displayed complete fibrovascular ingrowth compared to Medpor implants (57.1%) at six weeks post-implantation (p=0.001). In conclusion, bovine bone dHA and Medpor orbital implants were well-tolerated clinically and displayed similar inflammatory reactions and fibrovascular tissue maturation. Locally synthesized bovine bone dHA orbital implants displayed significantly greater complete fibrovascular ingrowth in comparison with Medpor implants. "
Spectrum of the neurologic manifestations in childhood-onset cryopyrin-associated periodic syndrome.,"Although chebulic acid isolated from <i>Terminalia chebular</i> has diverse biological effects, its effects on the expression of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) and the expression of downstream genes have not been elucidated. The purpose of this research is to investigate the hepatoprotective mechanism of chebulic acid against oxidative stress produced by <i>tert</i>-butyl hydroperoxide (<i>t</i>-BHP) in liver cells. The treatment with chebulic acid attenuated cell death in <i>t</i>-BHP-induced HepG2 liver cells and increased intracellular glutathione content, upregulated the activity of heme oxygenase-1, and also increased the translocation of Nrf2 into the nucleus and Nrf2 target gene expression in a dose-dependent manner. The exposure of chebulic acid activated the phosphorylation of mitogen-activated protein kinases. The overall result is that chebulic acid has cytoprotective effect on <i>t</i>-BHP-induced hepatotoxicity in HepG2 cells through Nrf2-mediated antioxidant enzymes. "
The impact of corneal guttata on the results of cataract surgery.,"To report a rapid endogenous fulminating panophthalmitis from <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> in a patient with diverticulitis and proliferative diabetic retinopathy. A 61-year-old female with poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, active proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and recent diverticulitis presented with conjunctival injection, ocular discharge, and sudden onset of painful vision loss of the left eye. Patient denied history of ocular trauma, intraocular surgery, or intravenous drug abuse. Examination revealed an erythematous, proptotic eye with restricted extraocular movements, mucopurulent discharge, diffuse corneal edema, and vitreous haze and cell. Orbital computed tomography (CT) confirmed no retained intraocular foreign body. Despite 48 hours of treatment with systemic broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy (vancomycin, meropenem, and amphotericin B), patient underwent enucleation due to declined condition and progressive infection. Patient's culture revealed gram-positive bacillus microbes (<i>Clostridium perfringens</i>). Patient's subsequent CT abdomen showed resolved diverticulitis after antimicrobial therapy. Although rare, <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> infection can be a cause of rapid loss of vision from fulminate endogenous panophthalmitis. Urgent extensive systemic work-up to identify potential port of entry from visceral pathology and rapid removal of source of infection are pivotal to avoid high rate of mortality. "
Assessment of Monocyte/HDL Ratio in Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion.,"Uveal melanoma is the most common primary malignancy of the eye in adults. Despite significant improvements in treatment of the primary tumor, to date none of these therapies prevent metastatic disease or improve overall survival. We are exploring immunotherapeutic options for metastatic uveal melanoma using MHC II uveal melanoma cell-based vaccines that target the activation of tumor-reactive CD4+ T cells. Previously, we showed that these uveal melanoma cell-based vaccines activate CD4+ T cells within total peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMC). Since PBMC include professional antigen presenting cells, we now demonstrate that Mel202/DR1/CD80 vaccine cells directly activate a diverse repertoire of purified, nave CD4+ T cells. The activated CD4+ T cells proliferated, secreted high amounts of interferon gamma (IFN) and produced a heterogeneous profile of Th1, Th2 and Th17 cytokines. Analysis of the TCR-V-repertoire showed that a polyclonal T cell response was induced, suggesting the capacity of vaccine-activated CD4+ T cells to target multiple tumor (neo)antigens. In addition, a subset of the responding CD4+ T cells expressed forkhead box protein P3 (FoxP3), indicating that although a regulatory component of the vaccine-activated CD4+ T cell response was induced, the anti-tumor vaccine response was not limited by these regulatory CD4+ T cells. Finally, Mel202/DR1/CD80 uveal melanoma vaccine cells expressed the intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) that was pivotal for CD4+ T cell activation via lymphocyte function-associated antigen 1(LFA-1). In conclusion, MHC II uveal melanoma vaccines activate purified CD4+ T cells and may serve as a novel immunotherapy for uveal melanoma patients. "
Integrated Tear Proteome and Metabolome Reveal Panels of Inflammatory-Related Molecules via Key Regulatory Pathways in Dry Eye Syndrome.,"China has become a key actor in global health diplomacy, particularly in Africa, but little attention has been given to the evolution of Chinese health assistance to African states. This paper conceptualizes Chinese health diplomacy in Africa over the past fifty years through three analytic frameworks: realist vs. constructivist motivations in international relations, vertical vs. horizontal initiatives for health assistance, and bilateral vs. multilateral approaches to global health. Drawing lessons from the evolution of American health assistance, we argue that a better understanding of these frameworks-recognizing why countries pursue health diplomacy, what vertical and horizontal strategies they use, and how they engage in this work bilaterally or multilaterally-could improve global health diplomacy.

Novel Nano-Liposome Formulation for Dry Eyes with Components Similar to the Preocular Tear Film.,"<b>Introduction</b> The importance of our study lies in the fact that we have demonstrated the occurrence of mechanical dysfunction within polypoid tissues, which promotes the development of polyps in the nasal cavity. <b>Objective</b> To change the paradigm of nasal polyposis (NP). In this new conception, the chronic nasal inflammatory process that occurs in response to allergies, to pollution, to changes in the epithelial barrier, or to other factors is merely the trigger of the development of the disease in individuals with a genetic predisposition to an abnormal tissue remodeling process, which leads to a derangement of the mechanical properties of the nasal mucosa and, consequently, allows it to grow unchecked. <b>Data Synthesis</b> We propose a fundamentally new approach to intervening in the pathological process of NP, addressing biomechanical properties, fluid dynamics, and the concept of surface tension. <b>Conclusion</b> The incorporation of biomechanical knowledge into our understanding of NP provides a new perspective to help elucidate the physiology and the pathology of nasal polyps, and new avenues for the treatment and cure of NP.

Natural history of dry eye disease: Perspectives from inter-ethnic comparison studies.,"<b>Introduction</b> Bilateral simultaneous endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy (endo-DCR) has received little attention in the literature, thus many surgeons continue to address bilateral nasolacrimal duct obstruction at two stages, rather than in the same setting. <b>Objective</b> To evaluate the feasibility and the outcome of simultaneous bilateral Endo-DCR and its impact on the quality of life of the patients. <b>Methods</b> We have conducted a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent bilateral simultaneous endo-DCR between March 2013 and February 2017 at our tertiary care institution. The reviewed data included clinical presentation; operative details; success rate; pre and postoperative evaluation of the symptoms of the patients, using the Nasolacrimal Duct Obstruction Symptom Score Questionnaire; satisfaction of the patients, and improvement in the quality of life, assessed by the Glasgow Benefit Inventory (GBI) questionnaire. <b>Results</b> Out of 128 cases in which endo-DCRs were performed, 13 were bilateral (26 sides). Postoperative success was documented in 24 of the 26 sides (92.3%), with a mean follow-up duration of 16.2 months. The two failed sides were reported in the same case. The preoperative symptom score ranged between 12 and 80 (meanstandard deviation [SD]: 38.2315.7). The postoperative symptom score was significantly lower (meanSD: 5.412.9). The success rates in unilateral and bilateral cases were comparable, with no statistically significant difference. A notable improvement in the quality of life of the patients was also reported, with a mean GBI score of 81.3812.37. <b>Conclusion</b> Our results support that a simultaneous bilateral endo-DCR is a safe procedure that offers a high success rate, spares the patient from the stress of a second surgery, provides the patient with a bilateral resolution of the symptoms, and confers an immediate improvement in the quality of life of the patients.

Neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) contribute to pathological changes of ocular graft-vs.-host disease (oGVHD) dry eye: Implications for novel biomarkers and therapeutic strategies.,"<b>Introduction</b> The Mismatch Negativity (MMN) auditory evoked potential evaluation is a promising procedure to assess objectively the ability of auditory discrimination. <b>Objective</b> To characterize the latency and amplitude values of MMN in children with normal auditory thresholds and without auditory complaints. <b>Methods</b> Children between 5 and 11 years old participated in the present study. All participants underwent acoustic immittance measurements and tonal and vocal audiometry. The MMN was recorded with the MASBE ATC Plus system (Contronic, Pelotas, RS, Brazil). The electrodes were fixed in Fz (active electrode), Fpz (ground electrode) and in M2 and M1 (references electrodes). The intensity used was 80 dBHL, the frequent stimulus was 1,000Hz and the rare stimulus was 2,000 Hz. The stimuli were presented in both ears separately. <b>Results</b> For the female group, the mean latencies and amplitude of MMN were 177.3 ms and 5.01 V in the right ear (RE) and 182.4 ms and 5.39 V in the left ear (LE). In the male group, the mean latencies were 194.4 ms in the RE and 183.6 ms in the LE, with an amplitude of 5.11 V in the RE and 5.83 V in the LE. There was no statistically significant difference between ears ( <i>p</i> =0.867 - latency and <i>p</i> =0.178 - amplitude), age ( <i>p</i> >0.20) and the gender of the participants ( <i>p</i> >0.05). <b>Conclusion</b> Using the described protocol, the mean latency value of MMN was 184.0 ms for RE and 182.9 ms for LE, and the amplitude was 5.05 V and 5.56 V for the left and right ears, respective.

Insight into the combinatorial transcriptional regulation on -amylase gene in animal groups with different dietary nutrient content.,"This meta-analysis aims to evaluate whether the <i>CD40</i> rs1883832 polymorphism is associated with Graves' disease (GD) risk in different populations. We performed a systematic literature search in China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), Web of Science, and Pubmed databases to identify case-control association studies on the association between rs1883832 and GD risk. For each study we calculated the odds ratios (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CI) assuming dominant, recessive and homozygote models. We then calculated pooled ORs and 95 % CIs. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 17 studies involving 4707 cases and 4215 controls were included in the meta-analysis. The results showed that rs1883832 was associated with GD risk in Asians under dominant (CT + TT vs CC, OR=0.67, 95 % CI: 0.56-0.81, P<0.001), recessive (TT vs CT + CC, OR=0.58, 95 % CI: 0.47-0.72, P<0.001), and homozygote (TT vs CC, OR=0.49, 95 % CI: 0.37-0.64, P<0.001) models. In Caucasians, rs1883832 was associated with GD risk under the dominant model (CT + TT vs CC, OR=0.82, 95 % CI: 0.68-0.99, P=0.042). Besides GD, we evaluated the relation of rs1883832 with Graves' ophthalmopathy (GO), finding that rs1883832 was associated with GO under the dominant model (CT + TT vs CC, OR=0.82, 95 % CI: 0.69-0.98, P=0.031). The findings of our meta-analysis suggest that the <i>CD40</i> rs1883832 polymorphism is protective against GD and GO in Asians and Caucasians. "
"A Phase 3, Randomized, Double-Masked Study of OTX-101 Ophthalmic Solution 0.09% in the Treatment of Dry Eye Disease.","Most studies about retinal detachment cover a limited follow-up period. The purpose of this research is to assess the long-term results after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) and scleral buckle (SB) surgery in patients with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). 155 patients with RRD are treated either with SB or PPV with a mean follow-up of more than 5 years. Retrospective analysis of patient data with RRD was performed between January 2006 and June 2008 at a tertiary eye clinic. Overall primary success rate was 85.2% (PPV: 84.6%, SB: 89.5%; p=0.57). 90.5% of redetachments appeared within the first 124 days. No significant different success rate was found for vitrectomy with and without additional encircling band (p=0.09). No advantage of a supplemental encircling band in cases of preoperative inferior breaks was seen (p=0.81). Patients of SB group were treated more frequently in follow-up time because of epiretinal membrane (ERM) (SB: 15.5% versus PPV: 7.3%). No patient of the PPV group without intraoperative use of endolaser cerclage (14.7%) had any peeling surgery postoperatively. Redetachment rates of both methods are comparable in a clinical setting where PPV is considered a suitable method for pseudophakic patients and in complex cases and SB was performed in younger phakic patients with clearly identified retinal tears. PPV seems to show a more heterogenous pattern of complications. No advantage of a supplemental encircling band could be found in these case series of patients with primary RRD. No relevant long-term risk of redetachment was seen after SB. "
Adhesion Strength and Rolling Properties of Descemet Membrane Endothelial Keratoplasty Grafts in a Rabbit Eye Model.,"Human retinal organoids from induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) can be used to confirm the localization of proteins in retinal cell types and to test transduction and expression patterns of gene therapy vectors. Here, we compared the onset of CRB protein expression in human fetal retina with human iPSC-derived retinal organoids. We show that CRB2 protein precedes the expression of CRB1 in the developing human retina. Our data suggest the presence of CRB1 and CRB2 in human photoreceptors and Mller glial cells. Thus the fetal CRB complex formation is replicated in hiPSC-derived retina. CRB1 patient iPSC retinal organoids showed disruptions at the outer limiting membrane as found in Crb1 mutant mice. Furthermore, AAV serotype 5 (AAV5) is potent in infecting human Mller glial cells and photoreceptors in hiPSC-derived retinas and retinal explants. Our data suggest that human photoreceptors can be efficiently transduced by AAVs in the presence of photoreceptor segments. "
Reply.,"To investigate to what extent the OSDI can be utilized as a discriminative test for clinical findings. One thousand and ninety patients with dry eye disease (DED) were consecutively included and examined for osmolarity, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), ocular protection index (OPI), ocular surface staining (OSS), Schirmer I test (ST), meibum expressibility (ME), meibum quality (MQ) and diagnosis of meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis considering optimum balanced sensitivity and specificity (close to 50%) was used for assessment. The present study on more than 1,000 patients indicates that the OSDI in the ROC curve analysis is a poor discriminator of pathological scores for TFBUT  5 (AUC = 0.553; p = 0.012) and  10 s (AUC = 0.608; p = 0.002), OSS  3 (AUC = 0.54; p = 0.043), ST  5 (AUC = 0.550; p = 0.032) and  10 mm/5 min (AUC = 0.544; p = 0.016), and ME  1 (AUC = 0.594; p = <0.001). Pathological scores for osmolarity > 308 and > 316 mOsm/L, OPI, OSS > 1, MQ and MGD could not be discriminated by OSDI (p > 0.05). Cut-off values for the OSDI can be defined to discriminate pathological TFBUT ( 5 and  10), OSS ( 3), ST ( 5 and  10) and ME, however, the discriminability was low. Our comprehensive study emphasises the importance of taking both symptoms and signs into account in DED management. "
EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE IN EYES WITH VITREOMACULAR TRACTION.,"To evaluate the efficacy and safety of intravitreal drug injections using a short 34-gauge needle. Retrospective study. This study included patients with age-related macular degeneration, diabetic macular edema, or macular edema associated with retinal vein occlusion. We reviewed the medical records of consecutive patients with one of those three diseases treated with antivascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents using an 8-mm-long 34-gauge needle. Sustained intraocular pressure (IOP) elevations were defined as IOP exceeding 21 mmHg or 6-mmHg or higher increases from baseline on 2 consecutive visits at least 1 month apart. The main outcome measures were improved best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), central retinal thickness (CRT), IOP changes, and incidence of complications related to the 34-gauge needle. Six hundred ninety-eight injections were administered to 243 consecutive patients (mean age, 74.0 years) and reviewed. The mean follow-up time was 30.2  15.9 weeks. The mean number of intravitreal injections/eye was 2.7  1.8 (range, 1-9). The mean BCVA improved significantly (P < .0001), from 0.43  0.4 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) units at baseline to 0.36  0.41 logMAR units at the last visit. The mean CRT decreased significantly (P < .0001), from 426.9  168.5 microns at baseline to 297.6  121.1 microns at the last visit. The mean IOP decreased significantly (P < .0001), from 13.6  3.0 mmHg at baseline to 12.9  3.1 mmHg at the visit after the first injection. A retinal tear occurred in 0.14%/injection (1/698). A sustained IOP elevation occurred in 1.29%/injection (9/698). Despite a few complications, the short 34-gauge needle was efficacious and safe for anti-VEGF intravitreal injections. "
REVERSE SUTURE TECHNIQUE FOR INTRAOCULAR LENS REFIXATION.,"To study glycemic control, mortality and long-term complications in children with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Cross-sectional study. Referral centre at a government teaching hospital. Patients with T1D with age 18 years at onset. We retrospectively collected demographic data from computer records from 1991 to 2015. Prospective study for outcomes was conducted between 2012 and 2016. Mortality rate, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and microvascular complication rate. The proportion of T1D patients (n=512) <5 years of age at onset was 18.6% between 1995 and 2004, and 24.2% in 2005-2014 (P<0.001). Twenty eight patients had died out of 334 whose living status was known (mortality 1.1 per 100 patient-years over 2549 patient-years follow up). Median (range) HbA1c (n=257) was 8.3% (5.1-15.0%). At least one episode of severe hypoglycemia (coma/seizure/inability to assist self) had occurred in 22.8% patients over two years. Hypertension was present in 11.7% patients. Microvascular complications screen in 164 eligible patients [median (range) age 20 (8-45) y and duration of diabetes 9.1 (5-30) y] showed diabetic nephropathy in 3.0%, proliferative retinopathy in 3.6% and LDL cholesterol >100 mg/dL in 34% patients. The mortality rate and prevalence of hypertension were high, given the short duration of diabetes of the patients. The proportion of patients with age 5 years at onset of diabetes has increased at our center. "
EARLY VITAMIN A SUPPLEMENTATION IMPROVES THE OUTCOME OF RETINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY IN EXTREMELY PRETERM INFANTS.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent sleep disorder associated with obesity, hypertension and metabolic syndrome. People with low socioeconomic status (SES) who are socially disadvantaged (eg, people belonging to an ethnic minority) have worse health outcomes. Thus, consequently, social inequality may potentially be a risk factor for OSA. This systematic review aims to summarize previous studies from the literature which investigate the association between SES, race/ethnicity and obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This review was performed in accordance with the PRISMA statement. A literature search in Medline, PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted. Articles published in English, Spanish, French, Italian and Portuguese, without publication date limits, and that aimed to analyze the association between OSA diagnosis and social disadvantage, were selected. In sum, 17 articles met the inclusion criteria. One was a longitudinal study, and the remainder were cross-sectional research. Low SES was indicated as a risk factor for the presence of OSA in most of the articles. Concerning racial/ethnic groups, a clear association with OSA does not emerge, since, in a few articles, the relation disappeared after controlling for variables such as obesity, comorbidities, and SES; suggesting that there may be differences only in OSA severity and sleep apnea phenotypes. The results of this systematic review point out that low SES could be a risk factor for OSA. Obesity, SES and disparities in health care could mediate the association between OSA and racial/ethnic minorities. Socioeconomic circumstance should receive more attention in sleep medicine research. "
Reply.,"We describe a modified endoscopic diving technique with an alternative irrigation system, different for the one used by Locatelli et al. (Clear vision 2, Karl Storz and Co. Tuttlingen, Germany). From January 2016 to October 2018, our senior surgeon performed the modified endoscopic diving technique in 76 endoscopic surgical procedures. Diving surgery was performed in all procedure to check the completeness of tumor resection thus allowing for the removal of any residual tumor tissue. In the modified endoscopic diving technique the optic system and the irrigation source are separated into two independent tools, allowing surgeons to point the flow on a selected structure, while the endoscope can be pointed in the same direction or not. Moreover, the optic system and the irrigation source can be placed at different distances. Surgeons can control the infusion pressure and the entity of the flow. The use of the modified endoscopic diving technique allows surgeons to have more settings that could be controlled, and also bypasses any compatibility issues between different endoscopic systems. In addition, the reproducibility of this technique, together with the low cost of the instrumentation, could allow an easier application of the diving technique. "
Determination of a No Observable Effect Level for Endotoxin Following a Single Intravitreal Administration to Cynomolgus Monkeys.,"Reoperation after decompressive craniectomy (DC) in patients with traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains a dilemma and the risk factors are to be identified. The aim of the current study was to determine the determinants and risk factors of reoperation after DC in patients with TBI. This retrospective case-controlled study was conducted during a 4-year period from September 2013 to October 2017 in a level I trauma center affiliated with Shiraz University of Medical Sciences in southern Iran. We included all the adult (18 years) patients with TBI who underwent primary or secondary DC in our center during the study period. Those who underwent reoperation were compared to those who underwent DC only regarding the demographic findings, clinical features and neuroimaging findings. A univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the determining factors of reoperation. Overall we included 371 patients with mean age of 36.4514.18 years. Among the patients there were 325 (87.6%) men and 46 (12.4%) women. The reoperation in patients undergoing DC due to TBI was associated with primary DC (p=0.039) and higher Marshall grade (p=0.027). Those who underwent reoperation after DC for TBI had significantly higher ICU (p=0.007) and hospital LOS (p=0.001) and lower 6-month GOSE (p=0.010). Age (p<0.001), GCS (p<0.001) and pupils (p=0.027) were predictors of outcome in reoperation group. Reoperation in primary DC group was associated with pupil reactivity (p=0.002) and number of episodes with INR above 1.5 (p=0.037) Conclusion: Reoperation after DC for TBI is associated with primary DC, and Marshall grade. The reoperation after DC is associated with worse outcome and longer ICU and hospital stay. The age, GCS and pupil reactivity are the main predictors of outcome in those with reoperation after DC for TBI. "
Prevalence and Associations of Posterior Segment Manifestations in a Cohort of Egyptian Patients with Pathological Myopia.,"To evaluate the neurodevelopmental and ocular developmental outcomes in premature children who have undergone intravitreal bevacizumab injection (IVB) for treatment of type 1 retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) DESIGN: Prospective case-control study SUBJECTS: We enrolled 3 groups of premature patients: premature children who had no history of ROP (Group 0), premature children with history of ROP without treatment (Group 1), and premature children who had received a single IVB (0.625 mg) for treatment of ROP (Group 2). Ocular developmental assessment, including cycloplegic refractometry, axial length and Cardiff acuity, and neurodevelopmental assessment via the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III), were performed at the age of 1 to 3 years, and were compared between groups. Ocular developmental outcomes and Bayley-III scores RESULTS: A total of 148 patients (85 boys and 63 girls) were included. The mean age of assessment was 1.49  0.59 years. Group 0 patients had significantly higher gestational age (GA), birth weight, and Apgar scores compared to Group 1 and Group 2. There were no significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 in demographics or systemic risk factors except for lower GA in Group 2. The cylindrical power was significantly larger in Group 1 and Group 2 compared to Group 0. The spherical equivalent was significantly more myopic and the Cardiff acuity was significantly poorer in Group 2 than in Group 0. There were no significant differences between Group 1 and Group 2 in refractive status, axial length or Cardiff acuity. Neurodevelopmental assessment using Bayley-III showed no significant difference among the three groups in any aspect after adjusting for GA and other systemic risk factors. The risks for poor neurodevelopmental outcomes were also not significantly different. At the mean age of 1.5 years, children with prior history of IVB (Group 2) have similar refractive and visual outcomes and similar neurodevelopmental outcomes compared to premature patients with ROP without requirement of treatment (Group 1), although there is a possibility that a small but clinically significant difference may not have been detected in the current study.

Incidence and prevalence of keratoconus in Denmark - an update.,"Cancer evolves from a combination of genetic and epigenetic abnormalities resulting in aberrant gene expression profiles as well as altered epigenomic patterns. Epigenetic alterations such as DNA methylation and histone modification play an important role in tumorigenesis. While in the pathobiology of uveal melanoma (UM) genetic changes have been well characterized, there is growing evidence suggesting that epigenetic changes are also involved. We investigated whether epigenetic modifications (global levels of histone acetylation, DNA methylation, ubiquitination) are detectable in UM tissues compared to healthy controls with respect to inter- and intratumoral heterogeneity. Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues of primary UM (n=15), UM metastasis (n=13), and control choroid (n=12) were immunohistochemically investigated by two ophthalmic pathologists for global levels of histone acetylation (Histone 3 acetylation, H3Ac; Histone 4 acetylation, H4Ac), DNA methylation (5-methylcytosine, 5-MeC; 5'-hydroxymethylcytosine, 5-hMeC), global ubiquitination (UBC) as well as Ubiquityl-Histone H2A (H2Aub). The nuclear staining intensity of primary tumors, metastases and control choroids was evaluated using a score from 0 to 3, which was multiplied with the percentage of stained cells (score from 0 to 4). The control choroid and the choroid next to the tumor showed a more intense nuclear staining than the primary tumor tissue. The choroid next to the tumor was stained less than the control choroid. The nuclear staining intensity in the tumor was comparable to that in the metastases. The tumor tissue itself often exhibited a heterogeneous staining pattern, as nuclei in the tumor center were less intensely stained than in the periphery. Cells with a presumed invasive potential (extraocular extension, growth along emissary canals) showed also an intense staining reaction. Although no prognostically relevant pattern of global epigentic markers could be identified, our results suggest that epigenetic changes play a role in UM pathogenesis and metastasis. In particular the staining reaction of tumor cell subtypes with a presumed invasive potential warrants further attention. The role of epigenetically relevant interactions with the tumor micromilieu should be further investigated as immune cells are predominantly located in the tumor periphery which showed a different staining intensity than the tumor center. However, as considerable epigenetic diversity exists in primary tumors, studies on biopsy tissue are not recommended for the immunohistochemical investigation of epigenetic markers. "
"Diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration: a survey of pharmacoutilization and cost in Calabria, Italy.","To compare choroidal vascularity index (CVI) in patients with arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (A-AION), non-arteritic anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (NA-AION) and control subjects. Retrospective cross-sectional study. This study was conducted at the Ophthalmology Unit of the S.Orsola-Malpighi University Hospital (Bologna, Italy). Macular and optic nerve head optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans of 20 patients with A-AION secondary to giant cell arteritis (biopsy-proven), 20 patients with NA-AION, and 20 control subjects were acquired with Heidelberg Spectralis (Heidelberg Engineering, Heidelberg, Germany). Images were binarized using the ImageJ software, and total choroid area (TCA), luminal area (LA) and stromal area (SA) were segmented. The main outcome measure was CVI, defined as the ratio of LA to TCA. Patients with A-AION showed a significantly lower macular and peripapillary CVI compared to both patients with NA-AION (respectively, 67.172.35 vs 69.664.18, P=0.048; 63.513.29 vs 67.673.07, P<0.001) and control subjects (respectively, 67.172.35 vs 70.00  2.95, P=0.021; 63.513.29 vs 68.69  3.19, P=0.002). Conversely, no significant difference in macular and peripapillary CVI was found between patients with NA-AION and controls (respectively, P=0.942 and P = 0.570). After adjustment for age, the difference of peripapillary CVI among groups remained statistically significant (P<0.001), while the difference in macular CVI did not (P=0.060). Macular and peripapillary CVI are reduced in patients with A-AION. These parameters may be useful to evaluate quantitatively choroidal vascular dysfunction in A-AION, serving as a new additional diagnostic tool to distinguish A-AION from NA-AION. "
Synthesis of saporin-antibody conjugates for targeting EpCAM positive tumour cells.,"We aimed to externally validate the performance of new screening criteria for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) developed in the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity (G-ROP) study among a Japanese cohort. Validation of screening criteria METHODS: We reviewed premature infants screened for ROP between September 2009 and May 2017 at a single institute. The G-ROP criteria, except hydrocephalus, were applied as a prediction model for infants with both a known outcome of ROP and serial measurements of weight gain. We assessed sensitivity and specificity for treatment-requiring ROP, and reduction in the number of infants who receive ROP screening and in the number of retinal examinations. Of 692 premature infants screened for ROP, 537 had information of ROP outcome and weight gain. In this cohort, 81 infants required treatment for ROP; in 218 infants, ROP regressed spontaneously, and 238 infants did not develop any ROP. The G-ROP model reached a sensitivity of 100% (95% confidence interval (CI), 95.4%-100%) and specificity of 28.9% (95% CI, 24.9%-33.2%). No infants required any treatment for ROP before the date of risk determination. The number of infants requiring screening and the number of examinations would have been reduced by 24.5% and 12.9%, respectively. This is the first validation study of the G-ROP criteria in a developed country other than North America. The criteria demonstrated high sensitivity in this Japanese cohort, even though the criterion of hydrocephalus was excluded. "
Design and fabrication of drug-eluting polymeric thin films for applications in ophthalmology.,"To examine the outcomes of phacoemulsification cataract surgery in eyes with herpes zoster-related keratitis and/or uveitis and evaluate the risks for recurrent disease. Public ophthalmology service, Auckland, New Zealand. Retrospective case series. Patients with herpes zoster-related keratitis and/or uveitis who had cataract surgery in the ipsilateral eye were reviewed. Outcome measures were intraoperative and postoperative complications, postoperative visual acuity, and recurrent disease. Fifty-seven eyes of 57 patients were included. Thirty-eight patients (66.7%) had recurrent disease before cataract surgery. Intraoperative complications occurred in 8 patients (14.0%) and included posterior capsule tear in 2 patients (3.5%). Postoperative complications included intraocular pressure of 30mm Hg or higher in 2 patients (3.5%) and central corneal edema in 8 patients (14.0%); all resolved by 1month. Cystoid macular edema occurred in 2 patients (3.5%). The median corrected distance visual acuity at 12months was 20/40 (interquartile range, 20/30-20/50). Corneal scarring was associated with poorer vision (P=.003). Herpes zoster recurred in 23 patients (40.4%) after surgery. An increased risk for recurrence was associated with shorter periods of quiescence (P=.029) and greater number of recurrences before surgery (P=.039). One eye was eviscerated because of the severity of the disease. Phacoemulsification in eyes with previous herpes zoster-related keratitis or uveitis posed a mildly increased risk for intraoperative and postoperative complications; however, herpes zoster disease recurrence after surgery was common and was severe in some cases. Consideration should be given to maximizing the period of quiescence before surgery and the potential role of antiviral prophylaxis. "
Survival of retinal ganglion cells after damage to the occipital lobe in humans is activity dependent.,"Trace amine-associated receptor 1 (TAAR1) is a G-protein coupled receptor with affinity for the trace amines. TAAR1 agonists have pro-cognitive, antidepressant-, and antipsychotic-like properties in both rodents and non-human primates (NHPs). TAAR1 agonism also increases wakefulness and suppresses rapid-eye movement (REM) sleep in mice and rats and reduces cataplexy in two mouse models of narcolepsy. We investigated the effects of TAAR1 agonism in Cynomolgus macaques, a diurnal species that exhibits consolidated night-time sleep, and evaluated the effects of TAAR1 agonists on cognition using a working memory (WM) paradigm in this species. Adult male Cynomolgus macaques (n=6) were surgically implanted to record the electroencephalogram (EEG), electromyogram, and locomotor activity (LMA) and the efficacy of the TAAR1 partial agonist RO5263397 (0.1,1,10mg/kg, p.o.) on sleep/wake, EEG spectra, and LMA was determined. In a second experiment, the acute effects of RO5263397 (0.1,1,10mg/kg, p.o.) were assessed on a delayed-match-to-sample test of WM in adult male macaques (n=7). RO5263397 (10mg/kg) administered at lights off, when sleep pressure was high, promoted wakefulness and reduced both REM and non-REM sleep without inducing hyperlocomotion. RO5263397 (10mg/kg) also increased delta/theta activity during all vigilance states. RO5263397 had no effect on WM at either short (2sec) or long (10sec) delay intervals. The wake-enhancing and REM-suppressing effects of R05263397 shown here in a diurnal primate are consistent with previous results in nocturnal rodents. These effects and the associated alterations in EEG spectra occurred without inducing hyperlocomotion or affecting WM, encouraging further study of TAAR1 agonists as potential narcolepsy therapeutics.

Simultaneous diagnosis of unilateral retinoblastoma and contralateral optic pathway glioma in a child with neurofibromatosis type 1.,"A periventricular gradient of normal appearing white matter (NAWM) damage has been described in multiple sclerosis (MS), including subjects with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS). The pathological mechanisms underlying this gradient is not currently understood. 34 CIS subjects were enrolled and underwent cerebrospinal fluid oligo-clonal bands (CSF-OCB) evaluation. Moreover, all CIS subjects and 24 healthy controls underwent a brain MRI scan. Diffusion weighted imaging was used to compute mean diffusivity (MD) values in periventricular and deep NAWM for all groups. CSF-OCB were present in 24 CIS subjects (CSF-OCB+) out of 34 tested. Periventricular NAWM MD values were significantly higher in CIS subjects with than in those without CSF-OCB (0.780.06mm<sup>3</sup>/10<sup>-3</sup> vs. 0.720.06mm<sup>3</sup>/10<sup>-3</sup>; p=0.01), while there was no difference between groups in deep NAWM MD values. The periventricular gradient of damage, expressed in z score based on healthy controls data, was more marked in CSF-OCB+ than in CSF-OCB- (0.650.05 vs. 0.170.04 p<0.001). There was no difference in periventricular lesion load between the two groups. In CIS, the presence of CSF-OCB is associated with the severity of periventricular NAWM damage gradient. Intrathecal inflammation could play a role in NAWM damage distribution. "
A Quantitative Chloride Channel Conductance Assay for Efficacy Testing of AAV.BEST1.,"It is of considerable interest to construct an ideal drug delivery system (i.e., high drug payload, minimal cytotoxicity, rapid endocytosis, and lysosomal escape) under mild conditions for disease treatment, tissue engineering, bioimaging, etc. Inspired by the coordinative interactions between histidine and metal ions, we present the facile synthesis of hexahistidine (His<sub>6</sub>)-metal assembly (HmA) particles under mild conditions for the first time. The HmA particles presented a high loading capacity, a wide variety of loadable drugs, minimal cytotoxicity, quick internalization, the ability to bypass the lysosomes, and rapid intracellular drug release. In addition, HmA encapsulation largely improved the antitumor ability of camptothecin (CPT) relative to free CPT. By capitalizing on these promising features in drug delivery, HmA will have great potential in various biomedical fields.

Quantitative evaluation of primary retinitis pigmentosa patients using colour Doppler flow imaging and optical coherence tomography angiography.,"The etiology of conjunctivitis is often misdiagnosed. An ideal diagnostic test would identify all possible infectious causes. In this study, we apply unbiased metagenomic RNA deep sequencing (MDS) to identify pathogens causing conjunctivitis. Molecular study of prospectively collected conjunctival swabs from patients with presumed infectious conjunctivitis. Patients with presumed acute infectious conjunctivitis. Conjunctival swabs were collected from patients presenting with acute conjunctivitis. Swabs were processed for MDS. Pathogens were identified using a rapid computational pipeline to analyze the non-host sequences obtained from MDS. Differential gene expression analysis was performed to evaluate for host transcriptome signatures for infectious types. Clinical samples were de-identified and laboratory personnel handling the samples and interpreting the data were masked. Pathogens and differential transcripts identified by MDS. MDS detected pathogens in 86% (12/14) of the patients tested. Swabs from 10 of 14 patients were positive for human adenovirus (HAdV) while swabs from 2 of 14 patients were positive for Vittaforma corneae (a parasitic fungal species of the microsporidia group). Samples positive for HAdV by RNA-seq were independently verified in a CLIA-certified laboratory. Directed pathogen-PCR confirmed the presence of V. corneae genome in the samples positive by RNA-seq. Local host transcriptome analysis identified 12 differentially expressed genes that provided distinct expression signatures for patients infected with HAdV compared to V. corneae. MDS can reliably detect and quantify common and rare pathogens causing conjunctivitis, and identify strains. The unbiased nature of metagenomic RNA deep sequencing allowed an expanded scope of pathogen detection, including fungal species not commonly associated with acute conjunctivitis. In addition, the identification of infection type-specific local host transcriptome signatures may allow for pathogen detection even when the pathogen load is too low for direct identification. "
Oxidative stress upregulates Wnt signaling in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells through activation of disheveled.,"To review the published literature on the use of swept-source optical coherence tomography (SS-OCT) for evaluating the lamina cribrosa in glaucoma. A PubMed and Cochrane Library literature search initially conducted on March 3, 2017 and updated on June 26, 2018 yielded a total of 64 articles. Articles that were reviews or that were not published in English were excluded, and 29 were found to fit the inclusion criteria. The panel methodologist then assigned a level of evidence rating to each study. Fifteen studies were rated level III, 14 studies were rated level II, and no studies were rated level I. Different aspects of the lamina cribrosa were studied using SS-OCT, including the anterior lamina cribrosa curvature, anterior lamina cribrosa depth, anterior lamina cribrosa insertions, laminar thickness, focal lamina cribrosa defects (FLCDs), and lamina cribrosa microarchitecture. In general, imaging of the anterior lamina can be achieved reliably, although shadowing from blood vessels at the neuro-retinal rim remains an issue. Imaging of the posterior lamina can be achieved with varying levels of success. In glaucoma, there is posterior migration of the anterior lamina cribrosa insertions as well as increased thinning and posterior curvature of the lamina cribrosa. FLCDs appear more commonly in glaucoma, and this may hint at the pathogenesis of axonal damage. In addition, there may be remodeling of the microarchitecture of the lamina, resulting in more variable laminar pores. There are limited studies comparing SS-OCT with spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) with regard to imaging of the lamina, but the difference in image quality between enhanced depth imaging (EDI) with SD-OCT and SS-OCT seems minimal. Imaging of the lamina cribrosa using SS-OCT has demonstrated that the lamina cribrosa is likely biomechanically active and that significant changes occur in glaucoma. The diagnostic utility of SS-OCT for lamina cribrosa imaging is promising, but standardized nomenclature, automated measurements, and longitudinal studies with larger and more diverse sample sizes are needed.

Cricoid-mental distance-based versus weight-based criteria for size selection of classic laryngeal mask airway in adults: a randomized controlled study.,"To determine the efficacy and complication rates of monocanalicular stents in the setting of canalicular lacerations. A literature search was performed in May 2018 in the PubMed database to identify all English-language reports of monocanalicular stenting to address canalicular lacerations. Studies that did not include at least 10 patients with at least 3 months of follow-up evaluation after surgery were excluded. Ninety-nine articles were identified, and 15 of these met criteria for data abstraction and were included in this assessment. The panel methodologist (V.K.A.) evaluated the quality of evidence and assigned a level of evidence rating to each of these studies. All 15 studies were rated as level III evidence. Anatomic and functional success rates after surgery ranged from 68% to 100% and 79% to 100%, respectively. Stents were generally well tolerated, although extrusion rates varied from 0% to 29%. Only level III evidence was available, and studies were not powered to detect differences between groups for rare complications or failure. Monocanalicular stents appear to be efficacious and well tolerated in the management of canalicular lacerations. Potential complications include extrusion (most commonly), tube displacement, granuloma, ectropion, slit punctum, fistula, and infection. Further comparative studies would help to identify the optimal time for device removal and to directly compare monocanalicular with bicanalicular stents. "
ARSACS as a Worldwide Disease: Novel SACS Mutations Identified in a Consanguineous Family from the Remote Tribal Jammu and Kashmir Region in India.,"Viral infections in human are leading cause of mortality and morbidity across the globe. Several viruses (including HIV and Herpesvirus), have evolved ingenious strategies to evade host-immune system and persist life-long. Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) and CRISPR-associated (Cas) is an ancient antiviral system recently discovered in bacteria that has shown tremendous potential as a precise, invariant genome editing tool. Using CRISPR-Cas based system to activate host defenses or genetic modification of viral genome can provide novel, exciting and successful antiviral mechanisms and treatment modalities. In this review, we will provide progress on the CRISPR-Cas based antiviral approaches that facilitate clearance of virus-infected cells and/or prohibit virus infection or replication. We will discuss on the possibilities of CRIPSR-Cas as prophylaxis and therapy in viral infections and review the challenges of this potent gene editing technology. "
Atypical Symptoms in Migraine-Related Alice in Wonderland Syndrome: Expansion of the Phenotype and Reflection on the Pathomechanism.,"This paper aims to identify key biological processes triggered by resection surgery in the extraocular muscles (EOMs) of a rabbit model of strabismus surgery by studying changes in gene expression. Resection surgery was performed in the superior rectus of 16 rabbits and a group of non-operated rabbits served as control. Muscle samples were collected from groups of four animals 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery and processed for RNA-sequencing and immunohistochemistry. We identified a total of 164; 136; 64 and 12 differentially expressed genes 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks after surgery. Gene Ontology enrichment analysis revealed that differentially expressed genes were involved in biological pathways related to metabolism, response to stimulus mainly related with regulation of immune response, cell cycle and extracellular matrix. A complementary pathway analysis and network analysis performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis tool corroborated and completed these findings. Collagen I, fibronectin and versican, evaluated by immunofluorescence, showed that changes at the gene expression level resulted in variation at the protein level. Tenascin-C staining in resected muscles demonstrated the formation of new tendon and myotendinous junctions. These data provide new insights about the biological response of the EOMs to resection surgery and may form the basis for future strategies to improve the outcome of strabismus surgery. "
Effect of 21-gene recurrence score in decision-making for surgery in early stage breast cancer.,"An 84-year-old woman with a history of dry age-related macular degeneration presented with an acute inability to read but intact writing ability (pure alexia or alexia without agraphia). She denied any difficulty speaking, paresthesias, or hemiparesis. Her visual acuity was 20/20 in each eye. Macular examination, optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein angiography demonstrated the previously diagnosed macular drusen and geographic atrophy of the retinal pigment epithelium consistent with the dry form of age-related macular degeneration OU. Automated perimetry revealed a right homonymous hemianopsia. Neuroimaging confirmed a left occipital ischemic infarction with involvement of the splenium of the corpus callosum producing the classic disconnection syndrome of alexia without agraphia. "
A randomized controlled trial of povidone-iodine/dexamethasone ophthalmic suspension for acute viral conjunctivitis.,"Although meta-analyses suggest that schizophrenia (SZ) is associated with a more severe neurocognitive phenotype than mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, considerable between-subject heterogeneity exists in the phenotypic presentation of these deficits across mental illnesses. Indeed, it is unclear whether the processes that underlie cognitive dysfunction in these disorders are unique to each disease or represent a common neurobiological process that varies in severity. Here we used latent profile analysis (LPA) across 3 distinct cognitive domains (cognitive control, episodic memory, and visual integration; using data from the CNTRACS consortium) to identify distinct profiles of patients across psychotic illnesses. LPA was performed on a sample of 223 psychosis patients (59 with Type I bipolar disorder, 88 with SZ, and 76 with schizoaffective disorder). Seventy-three healthy control participants were included for comparison but were not included in sample LPA. Three latent profiles (""Low,"" ""Moderate,"" and ""High"" ability) were identified as the underlying covariance across the 3 domains. The 3-profile solution provided highly similar fit to a single continuous factor extracted by confirmatory factor analysis, supporting a unidimensional structure. Diagnostic ratios did not significantly differ between profiles, suggesting that these profiles cross diagnostic boundaries (an exception being the Low ability profile, which had only one bipolar patient). Profile membership predicted Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Young Mania Rating Scale symptom severity as well as everyday communication skills independent of diagnosis. Biological, clinical and methodological implications of these findings are discussed. "
Outcomes of resident-performed small incision cataract surgery in a university-based practice in the USA.,"Early diagnosis of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis (AIFRS) is vital to improving outcomes in immunocompromised patients. This study evaluated the impact of a systematic protocol with nasal endoscopy and biopsies to early detect AIFRS in immunocompromised patients. Additionally, we compared the accuracy of frozen-section biopsy and culture with formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) biopsy. Retrospective cohort in a Tertiary Referral Hospital. Patients with the suspected diagnosis of AIFRS were evaluated following a standardized protocol, including serial nasal endoscopies and biopsies when necessary. The sensitivity and specificity of frozen-section biopsy and culture were also compared with FFPE. The mortality rate related to AIFRS of this standardized cohort (13/43) was 30.2%. Better outcomes were observed in patients with disease limited to the turbinates and in those with higher peripheral neutrophils count. Frozen-section biopsy positivity correlated with FFPE findings for fungi detection (p-value<0.0001), with a sensitivity of 90.6%, specificity of 72.7%, and accuracy of 86.0%. Implementation of this standardized protocol was related to a considerably low mortality rate among patients with suspected AIFRS at our Institution. Frozen-section biopsy revealed high accuracy to diagnose AIFRS. The current protocol including frozen-tissue biopsy improved the evaluation and survival rates of immunocompromised patients with presumed AIFRS. "
Long-term efficacy and safety of infliximab and cyclosporine combination therapy for refractory uveoretinitis in Behet's disease.,"Pseudophakic cystoid macular oedema (PCMO) remains a significant cause of compromised post-operative vision in contemporary cataract surgery. Well-established risk factors include intraoperative complications such as posterior capsule rupture and pre-operative factors including: diabetes mellitus, uveitis, retinal vein occlusion, epiretinal membrane. The role of topical glaucoma medications in PCMO continues to be debated. Current treatment strategies largely target suppression of inflammation. Topical NSAIDs remain the mainstay in prophylaxis and treatment of PCMO. Topical corticosteroids are commonly used as monotherapy or in combination with NSAIDs. Unfortunately, high-quality trials are notably lacking for other PCMO treatment modalities such as: periocular corticosteroids, orbital floor triamcinolone, intravitreal triamcinolone, corticosteroid implants, intravitreal bevacizumab and pars-plana vitrectomy. A lack of consistency in defining PCMO and resolution of PCMO explains why even large systematic reviews may come to contradictory conclusions. This review explores the varied contemporary evidence-base in relation to the aetiology, diagnosis, prophylaxis and treatment of PCMO. "
Retinal-detachment repair and vitreous-like-body reformation via a thermogelling polymer endotamponade.,"To describe a surgical technique, using a human amniotic membrane (hAM) plug, in two cases of retinal detachment with a large macular tear. Surgical technique description with surgical video. A 23-gauge pars plana vitrectomy with peripheral retinectomy was performed. An hAM plug was implanted under the neuroretina to seal the posterior retinal break. Standard silicone oil tamponade was performed at the end of the surgery. The patients were positioned face down after the operation for the first 2weeks. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans were performed in the follow-ups. The 1week postoperative OCT showed a neuroretina ingrowth over the hAM plug. The 3-month OCT showed a regenerated neurosensory retina entirely covering the hAM plug. Visual acuity improved from light perception to 20/400 (LogMAR 1,3) 3months after the operation in both patients. The silicone oil was extracted 4months after surgery, and no recurrences were observed. The patients' visual acuity remained stable at 20/400 after the silicone oil extraction. In these complex cases, hAM transplantation can be a valid option not only to help the retinal reattachment but also for a partial regenerative effect which, in these cases, was accompanied by a visual acuity recovery.

The potential and value of objective eye tracking in the ophthalmology clinic.,"In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) allows non-invasive imaging of the living human cornea, specifically enabling the detection of immune cells in the healthy and diseased ocular anterior segment. Studies using IVCM have provided insight into the effects of contact lens wear on corneal Langerhans cell density and morphology, and the effects of eye drops on conjunctiva-associated lymphoid tissue. IVCM has also been shown to be a useful adjunctive diagnostic tool in distinguishing infective and non-infective uveitis and in diagnosing atypical infective keratitis. In the research setting, this technology has enhanced our understanding of the role of inflammatory cells in corneal neuropathy and angiogenesis. In vivo - ex vivo correlation using animal models has helped overcome some of the difficulties in identifying cell type on IVCM images. As highlighted in this review, currently there are multiple established, and emerging, clinical and research applications for IVCM in the inflamed anterior segment. "
Foveal and parafoveal choroidal thickness pattern measuring by swept source optical coherence tomography.,"Higher, but also lower resting heart rate (HR), has been associated with increased cardiovascular events and mortality. Little is known about the interplay between HR, cardiovascular risk factors, concomitant diseases, vascular (endothelial) function, neurohormonal biomarkers, and all-cause mortality in the general population. Thus, we aimed to investigate these relationships in a population-based cohort. 15,010 individuals (aged 35-74at enrolment in 2007-2012) from the Gutenberg Health Study were analyzed. Multivariable regression modeling was used to assess the relation between the variables and conditional density plots were generated for cardiovascular risk factors, diseases, and mortality to show their dependence on HR. There were 714 deaths in the total sample at 7.671.68years of follow-up. The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, arterial hypertension, coronary and peripheral artery disease, chronic heart failure, and previous myocardial infarction exhibited a J-shaped association with HR. Mortality showed a similar relation with a nadir of 64 beats per minute (bpm) in the total sample. Each 10bpm HR reduction in HR<64 subjects was independently associated with increased mortality (Hazard Ratio 1.36; 95% confidence interval 1.06-1.75). This increased risk was also present in HR>64 subjects (Hazard Ratio 1.29; 95% confidence interval 1.19-1.41 per 10bpm increase in HR). Results found for vascular and neurohormonal biomarkers exhibited a differential picture in subjects with a HR below and above the nadir. These results indicate that in addition to a higher HR, a lower HR is associated with increased mortality. "
Adeno-associated virus neutralising antibodies in type 1 diabetes mellitus.,"Alterations in brain intrinsic activity-as organized in resting-state networks (RSNs) such as sensorimotor network (SMN), salience network (SN), and default-mode network (DMN)-and in neurotransmitters signaling-such as dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT)-have been independently detected in psychiatric disorders like bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. Thus, the aim of this work was to investigate the relationship between such neurotransmitters and RSNs in healthy, by reviewing the relevant work on this topic and performing complementary analyses, in order to better understand their physiological link, as well as their alterations in psychiatric disorders. According to the reviewed data, neurotransmitters nuclei diffusively project to subcortical and cortical regions of RSNs. In particular, the dopaminergic substantia nigra (SNc)-related nigrostriatal pathway is structurally and functionally connected with core regions of the SMN, whereas the ventral tegmental area (VTA)-related mesocorticolimbic pathway with core regions of the SN. The serotonergic raphe nuclei (RNi) connections involve regions of the SMN and DMN. Coherently, changes in neurotransmitters activity impact the functional configuration and level of activity of RSNs, as measured by functional connectivity (FC) and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations/temporal variability of BOLD signal. Specifically, DA signaling is associated with increase in FC and activity in the SMN (hypothetically via the SNc-related nigrostriatal pathway) and SN (hypothetically via the VTA-related mesocorticolimbic pathway), as well as concurrent decrease in FC and activity in the DMN. By contrast, 5-HT signaling (via the RNi-related pathways) is associated with decrease in SMN activity along with increase in DMN activity. Complementally, our empirical data showed a positive correlation between SNc-related FC and SMN activity, whereas a negative correlation between RNi-related FC and SMN activity (along with tilting of networks balance toward the DMN). According to these data, we hypothesize that the activity of neurotransmitter-related neurons synchronize the low-frequency oscillations within different RSNs regions, thus affecting the baseline level of RSNs activity and their balancing. In our model, DA signaling favors the predominance of SMN-SN activity, whereas 5-HT signaling favors the predominance of DMN activity, manifesting in distinct behavioral patterns. In turn, alterations in neurotransmitters signaling (or its disconnection) may favor a correspondent functional reorganization of RSNs, manifesting in distinct psychopathological states. The here suggested model carries important implications for psychiatric disorders, providing novel and well testable hypotheses especially on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. "
Sterile keratitis following standard corneal collagen crosslinking: A case series and literature review.,"To determine the practice patterns of ophthalmic plastic surgeons regarding the management of eyelid sebaceous carcinoma (SC). An electronic survey was distributed to oculoplastic surgical colleagues in the Asia Pacific region requesting clinical information and treatment approaches to SC. The responses from 192 respondents from the Asia Pacific region was included and analyzed in this study. For initial diagnosis, most surgeons selected incisional biopsy (55%), followed by complete excision (35%). Initial workup was mainly by palpation of lymph nodes, chest X-ray, and computerized tomography scan (CT-scan) of the orbit. Conjunctival map biopsy was done in selected cases. Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) was done mainly for tumors larger than 10mm. Management was mainly by surgical excision (5mm margin) combined with adjuvant therapy in some cases, with radiotherapy being the most common. Margin status was determined most frequently by frozen section as evaluated by the pathologist (57%) followed by Mohs micrographic surgery (18%). Surveillance was based mainly on physical examination alone. The Asia Pacific oculoplastic surgeons prefer incisional biopsy for lesions suspicious of SC prior to definitive surgery. This is in contrast to survey results previously reported in other populations. Frozen section control (done by an oculoplastic surgeon with pathology support) is most commonly used for margin control and conjunctival map biopsies are done only in selected cases. Despite the potential benefits of SLNB, access and expertise in this area is currently lacking in the Asia Pacific region. "
Surgical outcomes after unilateral horizontal rectus surgery in children with infantile esotropia for the correction of A or V pattern.,"To evaluate the long-term effect of cataract surgery on highly myopic patients with myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) and the risk factors associated with MTM progression. Highly myopic patients with cataract and MTM were included. Phacoemulsification surgery was performed on patients who had vision loss below 20/63 and were willing to operation. Exclusion criteria included full thickness macular hole, foveal/retinal detachment, history of vitreoretinal surgery, myopic choroidal neovascularization, macular chorioretinal atrophy, peripheral lattice degeneration, incomplete follow up, or intraoperative complications. All patients underwent a complete ophthalmological examination. Optical coherence tomography examinations and microperimetry examinations were performed. A total of 229 patients (mean age: 576 years) were recruited, including 179 operated patients and 50 unoperated patients. Both the best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and macular sensitivity (MS) were significantly improved after cataract surgeries throughout the follow-up period (p=0.000). No difference was found in the proportion of MTM staging and in the rate of resolving/stable or progressive MTM (p=0.757) between the operated and the unoperated groups. Of all patients, those with S2 to S4 MTM at baseline had significantly higher risk of progressive MTM (p<0.001). Patients with absence of posterior vitreous detachment or with longer axial length at baseline had higher risks of progressive MTM. Cataract surgery generally improves the BCVA and MS of highly myopic patients with MTM. Preoperative vitreoretinal adhesion, longer axial length, and S2 to S4 MTM are risk factors for progressive MTM. A long-term follow-up on the development of MTM is recommended. "
Distinct segregation of the pathogenic m.5667G>A mitochondrial tRNA<sup>Asn</sup> mutation in extraocular and skeletal muscle in chronic progressive external ophthalmoplegia.,"Despite advances in artificial intelligence (AI), its application in medical imaging has been burdened and limited by expert-generated labels. We used images from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA), a relatively new imaging modality that measures retinal blood flow, to train an AI algorithm to generate flow maps from standard optical coherence tomography (OCT) images, exceeding the ability and bypassing the need for expert labeling. Deep learning was able to infer flow from single structural OCT images with similar fidelity to OCTA and significantly better than expert clinicians (P<0.00001). Our model allows generating flow maps from large volumes of previously collected OCT data in existing clinical trials and clinical practice. This finding demonstrates a novel application of AI to medical imaging, whereby subtle regularities between different modalities are used to image the same body part and AI is used to generate detailed inferences of tissue function from structure imaging.

MRI Histogram Texture Feature Analysis of the Optic Nerve in the Patients with Optic Neuritis.,"There have been significant advances in the understanding of the vasculitides in the past several years, leading to more precise classification and nosology. Ophthalmologic manifestations may be the presenting feature of and a clue to the diagnosis of vasculitis, or develop in the course of the illness owing to a common disease mechanism. Precise diagnosis and prompt treatment prevents short- and long-term ophthalmologic sequela. "
Synthesis of Fe-Fe<i>3</i>O<i>4</i>/rGO Composite with Heterostructure Through Room-Temperature Reduction as Photo-Fenton Catalyst.,"To explore the effects of netrin-1 on inflammation in Aspergillus fumigatus-infected mouse corneas and on proliferation and migration in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Netrin-1 and the receptor A2BAR were detected in normal and infected corneas from C57BL/6 mice and RAW 264.7 cells. The mice were injected subconjunctivally with recombinant netrin-1. The severity of the disease was determined by clinical scores, photography with a slit lamp, RT-PCR, western blotting, myeloperoxidase (MPO) assays and immunofluorescence staining of polymorphonuclear neutrophilic leukocytes (PMNs). The effects of netrin-1 on RAW 264.7 cells in vitro were determined by RT-PCR. The role of A2BAR was demonstrated in vivo by detecting the expression of IL-1, TNF-, and IL-10 in corneas pretreated subconjunctivally with an A2BAR antagonist (PSB1115). RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with Aspergillus fumigatus (A. fumigates) and netrin-1 with or without PSB1115 pretreatment. A cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation ability, and cell migration ability was determined by cell scratch experiments with HCECs. Netrin-1 expression decreased slightly after A. fumigatus infection and then increased to its peak. A2BAR expression increased at 1day post infection (p.i.), with a subsequent decline. Compared to the PBS control, exogenous netrin-1 attenuated the inflammatory response, PMN infiltration, and expression of the proinflammatory factors IL-1 and TNF-, while IL-10 expression was up-regulated. In RAW 264.7 cells, recombinant netrin-1 obviously inhibited the mRNA expression of IL-1 and TNF- and promoted the mRNA expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. Pretreatment with PSB1115 resulted in disease aggravation and higher levels of the proinflammatory factors IL-1 and TNF- both in vivo and in vitro. And the effect of netrin-1 on inflammatory factors was abolished by PSB1115. Moreover, compared to the control treatment, exogenous netrin-1 significantly facilitated the proliferation and migration of HCECs. Netrin-1 attenuates inflammation in C57BL/6 mice infected with A. fumigatus, and it may play this role via the receptor A2BAR. Additionally, netrin-1 can promote the proliferation and migration of HCECs. "
Visual and optical quality outcomes of SMILE and FS-LASIK for myopia in the very early phase after surgery.,"The maturation state of dendritic cell (DC) plays an important role in immune activities. Previously we had found that NF-B (p65) pathway could promote DC maturation and subsequent immune effects. But the upstream mechanism of this pathway was still unclear. Extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) activating its receptor P2X7R has recently been considered as the fourth signal to activate T lymphocytes. Here we aimed to find out the connection between P2X7R and NF-B (p65) pathway in DC maturation. Results showed that the expression of P2X7R and the intracellular ATP levels were increased along with the maturation of DC. P2X7R agonist stimulated the morphological changes of DCs into the appearance of mature DCs, and promoted the expression of NF-B (p65), as well as the release of IFN- and IL-12. Whereas, P2X7R inhibitor had the opposite influences. Co-immunoprecipitation assay confirmed the binding of P2X7R and NF-B (p65). Our study suggested that extracellular ATP could promote DC maturation and release of inflammatory cytokines through the binding of P2X7R and NF-B (p65). This is the first study to show the P2X7R-NF-B (p65) pathway in DC. Interference with this pathway may be able to regulate immune responses in areas like infectious diseases, inflammation, transplantation, tumor and autoimmune diseases. In addition, intracellular ATP level could be a new indicator of the maturation state of DC. "
Diagnostic test accuracy of diabetic retinopathy screening by physician graders using a hand-held non-mydriatic retinal camera at a tertiary level medical clinic.,"Hirayama disease is a rare neurological disease affecting primarily men in the second to third decades. To date there are only few reports from Italy. We report the case of three young basketball players who presented with clinical, electrophysiological and MRI findings suggestive for Hirayama disease. Although the pathophysiology of the disease is still unknown, several hypotheses have been suggested and two of these are the disproportionate growth of cervical spine and cervical cord/roots during adolescence and the chronic traumatism. We think that, in our cases, the height of basketball players combined with the constant stress caused by the sport, could have contributed to the development of the Hirayama disease. With this report we would stress the importance to be careful to consider this pathology in order to avoid misdiagnosis predictive of poor prognosis in young patients. "
Novel likely pathogenic variants in TMEM126A identified in non-syndromic autosomal recessive optic atrophy: two case reports.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of visual impairment in the working-age population. DR is a progressive eye disease caused by long-term accumulation of hyperglycaemia-mediated pathological alterations in the retina of diabetic patients. DR begins with asymptomatic retinal abnormalities and may progress to advanced-stage proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), characterized by neovascularization or preretinal/vitreous haemorrhages. The vitreous, a transparent gel that fills the posterior cavity of the eye, plays a vital role in maintaining ocular function. Structural and molecular alterations of the vitreous, observed during DR progression, are consequences of metabolic and functional modifications of the retinal tissue. Thus, vitreal alterations reflect the pathological events occurring at the vitreoretinal interface. These events are caused by hypoxic, oxidative, inflammatory, neurodegenerative, and leukostatic conditions that occur during diabetes. Conversely, PDR vitreous can exert pathological effects on the diabetic retina, resulting in activation of a vicious cycle that contributes to disease progression. In this review, we recapitulate the major pathological features of DR/PDR, and focus on the structural and molecular changes that characterize the vitreal structure and composition during DR and progression to PDR. In PDR, vitreous represents a reservoir of pathological signalling molecules. Therefore, in this review we discuss how studying the biological activity of the vitreous in different in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo experimental models can provide insights into the pathogenesis of PDR. In addition, the vitreous from PDR patients can represent a novel tool to obtain preclinical experimental evidences for the development and characterization of new therapeutic drug candidates for PDR therapy.

Spectral Domain Optical Coherence Tomography in Detecting Sub-Clinical Retinal Findings in Asian Indian Children with Down Syndrome.,"Environmental factors play an important aetiological role in dry eye. This cross-sectional study investigated the relationship between types of occupation and symptomatic dry eye. 40,501 employed people working 8h a week were included from the population-based Lifelines cohort in the Netherlands. Logistic regression was used to determine the association between symptomatic dry eye (assessed by the WHS questionnaire) and occupation (using the ISCO-08 classification system). After correction for age and sex, the professionals (e.g. legal, health, and business and administration professionals) (OR=1.14, 95%CI=1.08-1.19, P<0.001) and clerical support workers (OR=1.14, 95%CI=1.07-1.22, P<0.001) had the highest risk of dry eye of all 10 major occupation groups. Skilled agricultural workers (OR=0.57, 95%CI=0.49-0.67, P<0.001) and elementary occupations (OR=0.77, 95%CI=0.69-0.85, P<0.001), such as cleaners and carers, carried the lowest risk of dry eye. After additional correction for 45 dry eye associated comorbidities, professionals and clerical support workers showed no increased risk anymore, while craft and related trades workers, e.g. building workers and metal and machinery workers, showed the highest risk of dry eye (OR=1.12, 95%CI=1.02-1.24, P=0.01). This study underlines the importance of asking about type of occupation in dry eye patients. Screening forsymptomaticdry eye in high risk occupations such as in building workers and in indoor occupations with high screen use is relevant from an occupational health and work productivity perspective. The lower riskof dry eyein outdoor and active occupation is intriguing and justifies future studies to investigate potential protective and treatment effects. "
Strategies for Improving Ocular Drug Bioavailability and Corneal Wound Healing with Chitosan-Based Delivery Systems.,"To evaluate the retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) in a population of children diagnosed with primary congenital glaucoma (PCG). Cross-sectional study where 59 eyes from 59 children diagnosed with PCG and 87 eyes from 87 healthy children were evaluated by SD-OCT to measure the RNFL. The global average peripapillary RNFL thickness and sectional RNFL thickness were evaluated in both groups. Differences in global average and sectional thickness were analysed. Mean age in PCG group was 9.613.23 years old and in control groups was 8.472.99 years old (p=0.0516). There were statistically significant differences (p<0.007) in all sectors between both groups, except for nasal (p 0.015) and infero-nasal (p 0.009) sectors. SD-OCT is a promising tool for evaluating the eyes of children diagnosed with PCG. Future research should examine the test-retest variability of SD-OCT parameters and their ability to diagnose progression in these children. "
Hyaluronic Acid in the Third Millennium.,"Although olfactory dysfunction is an early warning sign of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and is commonly present in a range of other neurodegenerative disorders, the mechanisms for its pathogenesis are not yet clear. Since fMRI allows the mapping of spatial and temporal patterns of activity in multiple brain regions simultaneously, it serves as a powerful tool to study olfactory dysfunction in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. Nonetheless, there have been no reports to date of mapping odor-induced activation patterns beyond the olfactory bulb to the extended networks of olfactory and limbic archicortex, likely due to the small size of the mouse brain. Therefore, using an 11.7T magnet and a blood volume-weighted fMRI technique, we mapped the functional neuroanatomy of the mouse olfactory system. Consistent with reports on imaging of the much larger human brain, we mapped activity in regions of the olfactory bulb, as well as olfactory and limbic archicortex. By using two distinct odorants, we further demonstrated odorant-specific activation patterns. Our work thus provides a methodological framework for fMRI studies of olfactory dysfunction in mouse models of neurodegeneration. "
Anatomical and Functional Changes of the Retina and the Choroid after Resolved Chronic CSCR.,"Due to an increased crossing of the optic nerve fibers at the optic chiasm in albinism, the visual cortex receives largely monocular input from the contralateral eye. Here we investigated whether this obstruction of binocular integration at the cortical input stage also impacts on interocular information exchange at the high processing level of visual memory. Interocular transfer (IOT) of visual memory retrieval was tested psychophysically after monocular encoding in 8 albinotic participants and 24 healthy controls. The retrieval performance (hit rate, reaction time, d') was determined when using the same or different eye at encoding. To assess the effect of reduced visual acuity (VA) on recognition, we simulated interocular acuity differences (IOA) in two healthy control groups (each n=8), i.e., with large (VA: 0.89 vs. 0.12) and small simulated interocular difference (VA: 0.25 vs. 0.12), with the latter matched to that observed in the albinotic participants (VA: 0.20 vs. 0.15). A significant decrease in retrieval performance was observed in controls with simulated strongly reduced VA in one eye (p< 0.0001). For the other conditions and groups, including the albinotic participants, no dependence on VA and no significant difference between using the same or different eye was observed. This indicates interocular transfer and hence interocular information exchange in human albinism. These findings thus provide insights into the scope of plasticity of binocular information processing and inter-hemispherical information flow. "
Correction of NR2E3 Associated Enhanced S-cone Syndrome Patient-specific iPSCs using CRISPR-Cas9.,"Lean management is a set of principles aimed at improving processes by identifying and eliminating steps that do not add value to the consumer. Such steps lead to wasted time, resources and expenses, and result in customer and employee dissatisfaction. While initially invented and perfected for factory assembly lines in the automobile industry, it has since disseminated extensively and has repeatedly proven a powerful ""engine"" for improving quality and quantity in the healthcare setting. Lean implementation benefits include improved safety, reduced waiting times, increased patient satisfaction, and cost reduction. Nevertheless, it appears to be less familiar and appreciated in ophthalmology, and more specifically as a tool for managing an efficient eye care clinic. In this review, we explain what ""Lean"" and Six Sigma are, and highlight their implementation in settings such as cataract surgery, laser capsulotomy, an ophthalmic emergency room, as well as its role as a powerful tool for improving clinic patient flow. We discuss basic principles of Lean management, review examples of implementing these principles in an ophthalmology practice, and lastly, offer physicians practical tools for identifying ""wasteful"" processes and ways to eliminate them.

The Development of Keratopathy after Surgery-Indicated Chronic Rhinosinusitis: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,"To assess how often non-infectious anterior scleritis remits and identify predictive factors. Our retrospective cohort study at four ocular inflammation subspecialty centers collected data for each affected eye/patient at every visit from center inception (1978, 1978, 1984, 2005) until 2010. Remission was defined as inactivity of disease off all suppressive medications at all visits spanning at least three consecutive months or at all visits up to the last visit (to avoid censoring patients stopping follow-up after remission). Factors potentially predictive of remission were assessed using Cox regression models. During 1,391 years' aggregate follow-up of 825 affected eyes, remission occurred in 399 (299 of 588 patients). Median time-to-remission of scleritis=3.1 years (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.6, 3.9). More remissions occurred earlier than later during follow-up. Factors predictive of less scleritis remission included scleritis bilaterality (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR)=0.57, 95% CI: 0.42-0.75); and diagnosis with any systemic inflammatory disease (aHR=0.59, 95% CI: 0.39-0.87), or specifically with Rheumatoid Arthritis (aHR=0.64), Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (aHR=0.21), or Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (aHR=0.32). Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) Inhibitor treatment (aHR=1.69, 95% CI: 1.18-2.35) within 90 days was associated with more remission incidence. Our results suggest scleritis remission occurs in a majority by 3.1 years (less than in newly diagnosed anterior uveitis but more than intermediate uveitis), suggesting that periodic attempts at tapering suppressive medications is warranted. Remission is less frequently achieved when systemic inflammatory diseases are present. Confirmatory studies of whether adjunctive ACE inhibitor or statin treatment truly can enhance scleritis remission (as suggested here) are needed. "
Comparative analysis of cytokine profiles of glaucomatous tears and aqueous humour reveals potential biomarkers for trabeculectomy complications.,"To identify risk factors predictive of postoperative double anterior chamber formation after deep anterior lamellar keratoplasty (DALK) DESIGN: Retrospective institutional cohort study METHODS: The study group included all consecutive eyes undergoing primary DALK between May 2015 and October 2018 at Villa Igea private hospital (Forli, Italy). The indications for surgery were categorized as 1) Keratoconus without scarring; 2) Keratoconus with scarring 3) Non-keratoconus without scarring; and 4) Non-keratoconus with scarring. Multivariate binary logistic regression analysis was performed, introducing, as independent variables, those that reached a significance level of less than 0.05 in univariate analysis. The main outcome measure was whether or not postoperative double anterior chamber (AC) occurred. 591 eyes of 591 patients were included. The main indication for DALK was keratoconus (67.2%, n=397), and pneumatic dissection was achieved in 72.9% (n=431) of patients. Postoperative double AC was observed in 8.1% (n=48) of cases. Age, intraoperative central DM perforation, type 2 bubble formation, and presence of scar in keratoconic and non-keratoconic corneas were all associated with an increased risk of postoperative double AC formation in the univariate analysis. Manual dissection was not associated with double AC formation. The factors that remained significant in multivariate analysis were keratoconus with scarring (OR=3.56, p=0.02), non-keratoconus with scarring (OR=5.09, p=0.002), intraoperative central perforation (OR=6.09, p=0.03) and type 2 bubble formation (OR=14.17, p<0.001). Scarred corneas of both normal and abnormal shape are independent risk factors for double AC formation following DALK, along with intraoperative perforation and the occurrence of a type 2 bubble. "
Enhanced autophagic-lysosomal activity and increased BAG3-mediated selective macroautophagy as adaptive response of neuronal cells to chronic oxidative stress.,"To investigate the demographics, risk factors, microbiology and resistance pattern at a tertiary hospital and to detect the shifting trend over two decades. A retrospective observational case series. We reviewed all records of patients with microbial keratitis (MK) that were hospitalized in National Taiwan University Hospital between 2007 and 2016. Demographics, predisposing factors, pathogens, and clinical courses were compared to our previous study conducted from 1992 to 2001. Antibiotic susceptibility was compared with those conducted from 1994 to 2005. The percentage of patient 60 years and older in MK population was increasing (P =2.1E-21). The proportion of trauma-related MK declined while MK related to chronic ocular or systemic disorders rose. The prevalence of nontuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) showed a decreasing trend (P =0.0032) while Microsporidia has been increasingly detected. The two most common bacterial isolates were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (35.2%) and Staphylococcus species (13.2%). Managements of these infection did not differ in common pathogens between the two decades. The susceptibility of Staphylococcus species to oxacillin reduced significantly (P =0.002) and there was an increase in Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus keratitis. Contact lens wear remained the most common predisposing factor with Pseudomonas species as the major pathogen. However, chronic disorder-related microbial keratitis was on the rise along with an increasing trend of oxacillin-resistance in Staphylococcus species. We found a decreasing trend in NTM keratitis while Microsporidia keratitis was considered as emerging ocular diseases. Though Gram-negative isolates remained susceptible to all antibiotics tested, antibiotic resistance was more common in Gram-positive isolates. "
Successful treatment of an exudative choroidal hemangioma with oral propranolol in a 10-year-old boy.,"To compare the outcome between high-density subthreshold micropulse laser (HSML) treatment and half-dose photodynamic therapy (PDT) in chronic central serous chorioretinopathy (cCSC) patients, subdivided based on either focal or diffuse leakage on fluorescein angiography (FA). Design; Retrospective analysis of multicenter randomized controlled trial data METHODS: Patients were treated with either half-dose PDT or HSML (both ICGA-guided) and categorized in 2 groups, based on focal or diffuse leakage on FA. Clinical outcomes were evaluated at baseline and during follow-up. In the focal leakage group (63 patients), both at first evaluation and final visit, more PDT-treated than HSML-treated patients demonstrated a resolution of subretinal fluid (evaluation visit 1: 57% in the PDT group and 17% in the HSML group, p=0.007; final visit:75% and 38%, p=0.012). In the diffuse leakage group (93 patients), both at first evaluation and final visit, more PDT-treated than HSML-treated patients showed a resolution of subretinal fluid (evaluation visit 1:48% in the PDT group and 16% in the HSML group, p=0.002; final visit:67% and 21%, p=0.002). PDT-treated patients in the focal and diffuse leakage group had a higher retinal sensitivity increase, comparing baseline and final visit (+3.13.1dB versus +1.24.0dB, p=0.048, and +2.73.3dB versus +1.03.8dB, p=0.036, respectively). Only in the diffuse leakage group, the increase in ETDRS letters was higher in the PDT-treated group when comparing baseline and first evaluation visit (+4.46.1 versus +0.910.0, p=0.049). Half-dose PDT is superior to HSML treatment in cCSC patients, regardless of the presence of focal or diffuse leakage on FA. "
MicroRNAs in the cornea: Role and implications for treatment of corneal neovascularization.,"The evidence base supporting genetic and genomic sequence-variant interpretations is continuously evolving. An inherent consequence is that a variant's clinical significance might be reinterpreted over time as new evidence emerges regarding its pathogenicity or lack thereof. This raises ethical, legal, and financial issues as to whether there is a responsibility to recontact research participants to provide updates on reinterpretations of variants after the initial analysis. There has been discussion concerning the extent of this obligation in the context of both research and clinical care. Although clinical recommendations have begun to emerge, guidance is lacking on the responsibilities of researchers to inform participants of reinterpreted results.

Comparison of clinical features and visual outcome between Sympathetic ophthalmia and Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada disease in Chinese Patients.,"To determine the effect of molecular weight (MW) on the concentration of plasma-derived proteins in aqueous humor and to estimate the plasma-derived and eye-derived fractions for each protein. Aqueous humor and plasma samples were obtained during cataract surgery on an institutional review board-approved protocol. Protein concentrations were determined by ELISA and quantitative antibody microarrays. A total of 93 proteins were studied, with most proteins analyzed using 27 to 116 aqueous and 6 to 30 plasma samples. Plasma proteins without evidence of intraocular expression by sequence tags were used to fit a logarithmic model relating aqueous-plasma ratio (AH:PL) to MW. The log(AH:PL) appears to be well predicted by the log(MW) (P < 0.0001), with smaller proteins such as cystatin C (13 kDa) having a higher AH:PL (1:6) than larger proteins such as albumin (66 kDa, 1:300) and complement component 5 (188 kDa, 1:2500). The logarithmic model was used to calculate the eye-derived intraocular fraction (IOF) for each protein. Based on the IOF, 66 proteins could be categorized as plasma-derived (IOF<20), whereas 10 proteins were primarily derived from eye tissue (IOF >80), and 17 proteins had contribution from both plasma and eye tissue (IOF 20-80). Protein concentration of plasma-derived proteins in aqueous is nonlinearly dependent on MW in favor of smaller proteins. Our study demonstrates that for proper interpretation of results, proteomic studies evaluating changes in aqueous humor protein levels should take into account the plasma and eye-derived fractions.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography for Evaluation of Reperfusion following Pterygium Surgery.,"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the main cause of irreversible blindness among the elderly and require early diagnosis to prevent vision loss, and careful treatment is essential. Optical coherence tomography (OCT), the most commonly used imaging method in the retinal area for the diagnosis of AMD, is usually interpreted by a clinician, and OCT can help diagnose disease on the basis of the relevant diagnostic criteria, but these judgments can be somewhat subjective. We propose an algorithm for the detection of AMD based on a weakly supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model to support computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system. Our main contributions are the following three things. (1) We propose a concise CNN model for OCT images, which outperforms the existing large CNN models using VGG16 and GoogLeNet architectures. (2) We propose an algorithm called Expressive Gradients (EG) that extends the existing Integrated Gradients (IG) algorithm so as to exploit not only the input-level attribution map, but also the high-level attribution maps. Due to enriched gradients, EG can highlight suspicious regions for diagnosis of AMD better than the guided-backpropagation method and IG. (3) Our method provides two visualization options: overlay and top-k bounding boxes, which would be useful for CAD. Through experimental evaluation using 10,100 clinical OCT images from AMD patients, we demonstrate that our EG algorithm outperforms the IG algorithm in terms of localization accuracy and also outperforms the existing object detection methods in terms of class accuracy.

Aqueous Humor Cytokines and Long-Term Response to Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy in Diabetic Macular Edema.,"To determine if deep learning networks could be trained to forecast future 24-2 Humphrey Visual Fields (HVFs). All data points from consecutive 24-2 HVFs from 1998 to 2018 were extracted from a university database. Ten-fold cross validation with a held out test set was used to develop the three main phases of model development: model architecture selection, dataset combination selection, and time-interval model training with transfer learning, to train a deep learning artificial neural network capable of generating a point-wise visual field prediction. The point-wise mean absolute error (PMAE) and difference in Mean Deviation (MD) between predicted and actual future HVF were calculated. More than 1.7 million perimetry points were extracted to the hundredth decibel from 32,443 24-2 HVFs. The best performing model with 20 million trainable parameters, CascadeNet-5, was selected. The overall point-wise PMAE for the test set was 2.47 dB (95% CI: 2.45 dB to 2.48 dB), and deep learning showed a statistically significant improvement over linear models. The 100 fully trained models successfully predicted future HVFs in glaucomatous eyes up to 5.5 years in the future with a correlation of 0.92 between the MD of predicted and actual future HVF and an average difference of 0.41 dB. Using unfiltered real-world datasets, deep learning networks show the ability to not only learn spatio-temporal HVF changes but also to generate predictions for future HVFs up to 5.5 years, given only a single HVF.

Classification of Regions of Nonperfusion on Ultra-widefield Fluorescein Angiography in patients with Diabetic Macular Edema.,"We report a case of restrictive strabismus caused by early scleral buckle (SB) migration within 1month of surgery after successful medical management of SB infection. A 24 year-old man underwent scleral buckling surgery for left eye inferior retinal detachment (RD). A solid silicone buckle element was placed inferiorly along with an encircling silicone band. Two days after surgery, he presented with SB infection. Methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus was cultured from the exudate at conjunctival suture sites. Since the retina was well attached and it was only the second postoperative day, it was decided to retain the buckle. SB infection was treated with intravenous cefotaxime and topical fortified cefazolin and successfully eradicated. One month thereafter, anterior SB migration was noted on slit lamp biomicroscopy. Restrictive strabismus and diplopia were also noted. Eventually, SB removal was performed at 2months. This case report highlights the role of infection and subsequent inflammation as a cause for buckle migration and restrictive strabismus in the early post-operative period. These changes can be seen as early as 1month after primary surgery and may occur even after successful medical management of the SB infection. "
Glucose tolerance levels and circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness in a general Japanese population: the Hisayama Study.,"European consensus guidelines published in May 2013 recommended a target peripheral capillary oxygen saturation (SpO<sub>2</sub> ) range of 90-95% for preterm infants. These were incorporated into guidelines at the Karolinska University Hospital, Sweden, in November 2013. This study compared clinical practice before and after those local guidelines. We included infants who were born between 23+0 and 30+6 weeks from 1 January 2013 to 31 December 2015 and received intensive care in two Karolinska units. The lower saturation target of 88-92% and alarm limits of 85-95% used before November 2013 were compared to the new higher saturation target of 90-95% and alarm limits of 89-96%. Data from 399 infants were analysed. The mean SpO<sub>2</sub> was 92.4% with the higher target (n=301) and 91.1% with the lower target (n=98). Using the higher instead of lower target meant that the SpO<sub>2</sub> was within the prescribed target range more frequently (51% versus 30%) and the proportion of time with SpO<sub>2</sub> >95% was increased by 9% (95% confidence interval 7-11%, p<0.001). The higher saturation target and tighter alarm limits led to higher mean oxygen saturation, increased adherence to the target and increased time with hyperoxaemia.

Retinal vein occlusion is associated with low blood high-density lipoprotein cholesterol: a nationwide cohort study.,"Competence in cataract surgery is a public health necessity, and videos of cataract surgery are routinely available to educators and trainees but currently are of limited use in training. Machine learning and deep learning techniques can yield tools that efficiently segment videos of cataract surgery into constituent phases for subsequent automated skill assessment and feedback. To evaluate machine learning and deep learning algorithms for automated phase classification of manually presegmented phases in videos of cataract surgery. This was a cross-sectional study using a data set of videos from a convenience sample of 100 cataract procedures performed by faculty and trainee surgeons in an ophthalmology residency program from July 2011 to December 2017. Demographic characteristics for surgeons and patients were not captured. Ten standard labels in the procedure and 14 instruments used during surgery were manually annotated, which served as the ground truth. Five algorithms with different input data: (1) a support vector machine input with cross-sectional instrument label data; (2) a recurrent neural network (RNN) input with a time series of instrument labels; (3) a convolutional neural network (CNN) input with cross-sectional image data; (4) a CNN-RNN input with a time series of images; and (5) a CNN-RNN input with time series of images and instrument labels. Each algorithm was evaluated with 5-fold cross-validation. Accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and precision. Unweighted accuracy for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.915 and 0.959. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the 5 algorithms ranged between 0.712 and 0.773, with small differences among them. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the image-only CNN-RNN (0.752) was significantly greater than that of the CNN with cross-sectional image data (0.712) (difference, -0.040; 95% CI, -0.049 to -0.033) and the CNN-RNN with images and instrument labels (0.737) (difference, 0.016; 95% CI, 0.014 to 0.018). While specificity was uniformly high for all phases with all 5 algorithms (range, 0.877 to 0.999), sensitivity ranged between 0.005 (95% CI, 0.000 to 0.015) for the support vector machine for wound closure (corneal hydration) and 0.974 (95% CI, 0.957 to 0.991) for the RNN for main incision. Precision ranged between 0.283 and 0.963. Time series modeling of instrument labels and video images using deep learning techniques may yield potentially useful tools for the automated detection of phases in cataract surgery procedures. "
Abamectin induces apoptosis and autophagy by inhibiting reactive oxygen species-mediated PI3K/AKT signaling in MGC803 cells.,"An 83-year-old man presented with a 1-year history of abducens palsy. Brain MRA revealed arterial dolichoectasia of most cerebral vessels, including the basilar, internal carotid, and middle cerebral arteries. Abducens nerve palsy as a sole manifestation of diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia is unusual but may occur in diffuse intracranial dolichoectasia. "
Membrane assembly of aquaporin-4 autoantibodies regulates classical complement activation in neuromyelitis optica.,"To report the clinical features and treatment outcomes of patients with peripapillary choroidal neovascular membrane (CNVM) secondary to idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Retrospective, multicenter chart review of patients diagnosed with peripapillary CNVM in the course of the treatment and follow-up of IIH. Records were reviewed from 7 different institutions between 2006 and 2016. Ten patients (13 eyes) with a diagnosis of IIH and at least 3 months of follow-up developed CNVM. Three of the total 10 patients developed bilateral CNVM. The mean time from the diagnosis of IIH to CNVM diagnosis was 41 months. Mean follow-up period was 8 months after diagnosis of CNVM. All patients were treated with acetazolamide for IIH. Seven eyes were observed, and 6 eyes were given anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections, including bevacizumab, ranibizumab, and aflibercept. All CNVMs regressed with subretinal fibrosis, and visual acuity improved in most patients. Papilledema resolved in only 1 eye, while the other 12 eyes had persistent papilledema at last follow-up. Peripapillary CNVM, a rare complication of IIH, often resolves spontaneously with treatment of IIH. In vision-threatening and/or persistent cases, intravitreal anti-VEGF treatment may be a safe and effective therapeutic option. "
A Comparative View of Australian Education in Law and Medicine.,"To evaluate the outcome of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in the management of extrafoveolar choroidal osteoma. The authors performed a retrospective chart review of all patients with choroidal osteoma that did not involve the foveola and were treated with standard-fluence PDT. Nine eyes with extrafoveolar choroidal osteoma were studied. Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution best-corrected visual acuity at initial examination was 0.07 (Snellen 20/25). The osteoma was treated with 1 (8/9) or 2 (1/9) PDT sessions using 50 J/cm. After a mean follow-up of 49 months, the treated area of osteoma demonstrated complete (4/9) or partial (5/9) regression, with a mean of 73% regression in the PDT-treated areas. Tumor growth in the region of PDT was noted in 3 cases (3/9) (one tumor toward the foveola and two tumors at the margin away from the foveola), but in no case did the tumor reach the foveola. Therefore, PDT controlled tumor growth in 8 of 9 cases with only 1 of 9 cases showing growth through the PDT scar into foveola. Mean logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution visual acuity at last follow-up was 0.04 (Snellen 20/20) (P = 0.59). Photodynamic therapy is an effective modality for the management of extrafoveolar choroidal osteoma, minimizing tumor growth toward the foveola and preserving visual acuity. "
Fulminant Hepatitis Associated With Echovirus 25 During Treatment With Ocrelizumab for Multiple Sclerosis.,"To investigate the features of the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) on optical coherence tomography in eyes with early age-related macular degeneration with subretinal drusenoid deposit. We classified the eyes into three types: nonundulating RPE, undulating RPE, and wedge-shaped RPE. We compared the retinal vessel densities, retinal thickness, and choroidal thickness of a 3-mm-diameter zone. We classified 33, 27, and 20 as nonundulating RPE, undulating RPE, and wedge-shaped RPE eyes, respectively. The vascular densities of the superficial and deep capillary plexus showed differences; nonundulating RPE group (23.93  2.26% and 23.54  1.78%), undulating RPE group (22.29  2.80% and 21.94  2.42%), and wedge-shaped RPE group (21.93  2.70% and 20.63  2.42%, P = 0.010 and P < 0.001). The mean retinal thickness and choroidal thickness were also different, nonundulating RPE group (298.26  13.81 m and 180.08  55.49 m), undulating RPE group (285.29  21.88 m and 148.45  55.08 m), and wedge-shaped RPE group (274.86  20.62 m and 135.75  39.77 m) (P = 0.001 and P = 0.007). Altered features of the RPE on optical coherence tomography may indicate advancement in disease and be part of an overall degeneration process in these eyes. "
Efficiently Recording the Eye-Hand Coordination to Incoordination Spectrum.,"To characterize reductions in intraocular pressure (IOP) and the need for IOP-lowering medications following phacoemulsification combined with Kahook Dual Blade (KDB)-assisted goniosynechialysis and excisional goniotomy in eyes with angle-closure glaucoma and cataract. In this retrospective, interventional case series, preoperative, operative, and postoperative data were collected through 6 months of follow-up from 42 eyes of 24 subjects. Outcomes included mean IOP reduction, reduction in IOP-lowering medications, and the proportion of patients achieving IOP reduction20%, IOP 18mmHg, and reduction of1 medication. Preoperatively, mean (standard error) IOP was 25.5 (0.7) mmHg and the mean number of IOP-lowering medications used was 2.3 (0.1) per eye. Through 6 months of follow-up, mean IOP reductions of 10.1-12.8mmHg (38.4-49.5%; P<0.0001) and mean IOP medication reductions of -2.2 to -2.3 (91.7-98.4%; P<0.0001) were seen. At Month 6, 92.9% of eyes (39/42) achieved IOP18mmHg, 100% (42/42) achieved IOP reduction of 20%, 100% (42/42) required1 fewer medications for IOP control, and 85.7% (36/42) were medication-free. Phacoemulsification combined with KDB-assisted goniosynechialysis and excisional goniotomy safely provides statistically and clinically meaningful reductions in both IOP and the need for IOP-lowering medications in eyes with angle closure glaucoma. "
Differences in Cataract Surgery Rates Based on Dementia Status.,"PRCIS:: Optic nerve head perfusion was not significantly altered in subjects with normal tension glaucoma nor healthy individuals after performing the water drinking test, due to its limited effect on ocular perfusion pressure. Optic nerve head (ONH) blood flow can be maintained stable in healthy individuals because of a physiological phenomenon called autoregulation. Impairment of autoregulation has been shown especially under condition of normal tension glaucoma (NTG). The purpose of this study was to investigate the ONH blood flow autoregulation in patients with NTG by influencing the ocular perfusion pressure with the water drinking test. The study included 9 eyes from 9 Caucasian patients with diagnosis of normal tension glaucoma and 9 eyes from age- and sex-matched healthy individuals. In the glaucoma group, the antiglaucomatous therapy was paused 3 weeks prior to the investigations. Measurements of optic nerve head blood flow were performed with laser speckle flowgraphy (LSFG). After baseline measurements, individuals ingested 800mL of water in less than five minutes. Measurements were repeated after 15, 30 and 45 minutes. The water ingestion led to a significant rise in intraocular pressure (IOP) (P<0.001) but also mean arterial pressure (MAP) (P<0.001) in both groups. This resulted in stable ocular perfusion pressures (OPP) (P=0.051) with no significant difference between the groups (P=0.43). ONH blood flow remained stable over time in both groups (P=0.719). No significant interaction of time and group was shown for all parameters. Our findings show that the WDT does not significantly influence the OPP and therefore has to be considered inferior to other methods used to assess blood flow autoregulation. "
How I do it: The Neuro-Ophthalmological Assessment in Parkinson's Disease.,"This study aimed to evaluate potential risk factors for postoperative late low intraocular pressure (IOP) in patients with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) after trabeculectomy. Adult patients who were diagnosed with POAG and scheduled to perform primary unilateral trabeculectomy in our hospital were consecutively included. Blood samples prior to the surgery and aqueous humor samples during the surgery of each participant were collected. Patient demographics, preoperative assessments, and laboratory tests were compared in patients with or without late low IOP. The risk factors for late low IOP were evaluated using logistic regression modeling. The predictive value of ET-1 in aqueous humor for late low IOP was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Of the total 222 enrolled patients, there were 39 cases of late low IOP with an incidence of 17.6% (39/222). The multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor was the only independent risk factor for late low IOP after trabeculectomy (OR: 0.89, 95%CI: 0.79-0.98, P=0.021). ROC curve analysis showed that ET-1 concentration in aqueous humor was a predictor for late low IOP after trabeculectomy with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.639, a specificity of 84.62% and a sensitivity of 39.89%, respectively (P=0.006). Our study indicated that ET-1 concentrations in aqueous humor was an independent risk factor for late low IOP in POAG patients after trabeculectomy. "
A model of the oscillatory mechanical forces in the conventional outflow pathway.,"The present study evaluated the surgical outcomes of intraconal cavernous venous malformation according to their location in 4 right-angled sectors. Data regarding the surgical method and approach, surgical outcome, and postoperative complications were retrospectively analyzed for 18 patients with intraconal cavernous venous malformations that were surgically treated at the authors' center between March 2006 and May 2017. The lesion location was defined using 2 perpendicular lines connecting the optic disc and the 4 surrounding rectus muscles in the coronal plane, which resulted in the formation of 4 right-angled sectors (upper-outer quadrant, upper-inner quadrant, lower-inner quadrant, and lower-outer quadrant). Accordingly, there were 3, 3, 8, and 4 lesions in the upper-outer, upper-inner, lower-outer, and lower-inner quadrants, respectively. Ten patients received anterior orbitotomy and 8 received lateral orbitotomy. There were no recurrences during the follow-up period. All patients exhibited reduced proptosis after surgery. Vision improved in 4 patients and remained unchanged in 14. Five patients experienced ocular movement limitation (1 permanent and 4 temporary), 1 developed an inferomedial blowout fracture, 2 developed a temporary sensory deficit, and 1 developed temporary ptosis. The authors' findings suggest that intraconal cavernous venous malformations most frequently occur in the lower-outer quadrant. Although most lesions can be removed via anterior orbitotomy, large lesions located near the orbital apex or on the orbital wall require lateral orbitotomy. Ocular movement limitation is a common complication and can become permanent in rare cases, necessitating close monitoring. Lesion location and surgical approach do not seem to influence the postoperative complication rate.This is an open access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Long-term outcomes of strabismus surgery in Mobius sequence.,"To evaluate fundus examinations in terms of traumatic retinal tears or dialysis that may be related to canalicular lacerations (CLs). This retrospective study was conducted on patients with CL repair from June 1, 2009 to May 30, 2018. The authors collected the data from the patients' medical records, including their demographic details, mechanism and setting of injury, associated ocular injuries, type of stent used, setting of repairs, duration of follow-up, complications, pre- or intraoperative findings of biomicroscopic and fundus examinations, refractive errors, postoperative follow-up of fundus examination, and management. Sixty patients (43 males and 17 females) were included in the study. The mean age of all the patients was 27.50  21.72 (min: 1-max: 94) years. Isolated CL was found in 38 patients. Nonisolated CL, which means with some additional pathologies, were found in 22 patients (37%, approximately 1/3). Retinal follow-up records were available in 49 patients with a mean follow-up period of 7.48  9.82 months. Retinal tears were seen in 3 patients (0.05%) with no predisposing risk factors. Two of these tears were found in the follow-up period after the traumas. Consequent retinal tears after canalicular lacerations were not strongly addressed in previous works. In this study, the authors aimed to view CL from a different perspective. Canalicular laceration is also an ocular trauma that may threaten vision. The authors emphasized that performing detailed fundus examinations and follow-up in all canalicular traumas is necessary. "
Interfacial Electronic Structure Modulation of NiTe Nanoarrays with NiS Nanodots Facilitates Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution.,"To report a simultaneous occurrence of 2 rare corneal dystrophies. A 30-year-old man with a family history of posterior polymorphous corneal dystrophy type 3 (PPCD3) was invited for ophthalmic examination. Sanger sequencing of the coding regions and intron/exon boundaries of disease-associated genes, ZEB1 and UBIAD1, was performed. The clinical findings suggested co-occurrence of PPCD3 and Schnyder corneal dystrophy in the proband. This dual diagnosis was supported by genetic findings. He was identified to carry a previously reported heterozygous nonsense mutation in ZEB1: c.2157C>G; p.(Tyr719*), and a novel heterozygous missense mutation in UBIAD1: c.569T>C; p.(Ile190Thr). The mother of the proband only carried c.2157C>G in ZEB1, and slit-lamp examination of her corneas showed endothelial lesions characteristic of PPCD3. The sister of the proband carried c.569T>C in UBIAD1 and had corneal crystal deposition in her anterior stroma consistent with the diagnosis of Schnyder corneal dystrophy. This case illustrates the coincidental occurrence of 2 rare and genetically distinct corneal dystrophies in a single patient. Furthermore, it highlights the need to perform comprehensive phenotyping in combination with appropriate genetic diagnostic testing to achieve an accurate diagnosis. "
Magnetisation transfer ratio abnormalities in primary and secondary progressive multiple sclerosis.,"To determine whether improvement in the severity of dry eye disease (DED) symptoms correlates with improvement in anxiety and depression. This prospective interventional case series recruited 45 adults with evidence of DED. Patients were administered the University of North Carolina Dry Eye Management Scale (DEMS), Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale (GAD-7), and Personal Health Questionnaire Depression Scale (PHQ-8) to evaluate the severity of DED symptoms, anxiety, and depression, respectively. Standard of care treatment was provided for patients for 3 to 6 months, followed by re-administration of the DEMS, GAD-7, and PHQ-9 surveys. Statistical analysis was performed to assess the relationships between changes in survey scores. Participants had a mean age of 65.5 (SD, 13.3) years, and 37 (84.6%) were women. Seven patients were lost to follow-up. DEMS and GAD-7 significantly improved from 5.8  1.8 to 4.6  0.2.2 (P = 0.01) and from 5.6  5.5 to 3.3  4.6 (P = 0.05), respectively. Changes in DEMS correlated with changes in PHQ-8 ( = 0.3 P = 0.05), but not with changes in GAD-7 ( = 0.2 P = 0.3). Changes in DEMS correlated with changes in both PHQ-8 and GAD-7 in the subgroup of patients without prior depression or anxiety diagnosis ( = 0.6, P = 0.002;  = 0.4, P = 0.02). A multivariate analysis showed that the relationship between DEMS, PHQ-8, and GAD-7 was independent of a prior diagnosis of depression or anxiety and of the presence of comorbidities. There is a significant correlation between the severity of DED and symptoms of depression and anxiety. Effective DED treatment could have a positive impact on the symptoms of depression and anxiety.

"Ophthalmic, systemic, and genetic characteristics of patients with Wolfram syndrome.","To describe the development and resolution of corneal edema in 3 patients who were exposed to compounds that stimulate dopaminergic pathways. We conducted a review of the literature on bilateral corneal edema secondary to amantadine use and report a case series of corneal edema seen in an outpatient ophthalmology specialty clinic, shortly after exposure to agents that enhance dopamine transmission. Cases 1 and 2 report a 25-year-old man with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and a 73-year-old man with Parkinson disease who were placed on dopaminergic medications to treat their conditions. The former was administered methylphenidate and the latter patient was administered ropinirole. Both patients developed corneal edema soon afterward. Case 3 is a 67-year-old man with a recent exposure to resin from Euphorbia resinifera, a cactus in his garden. After cessation of the offending medications and treatment for exposure to resiniferatoxin, the corneal edema progressively resolved and visual acuity returned to baseline in all 3 cases. Methylphenidate, ropinirole, and resiniferatoxin have different mechanisms of actions but have a common end point leading to increased dopamine. We believe that these agents are linked with the reversible corneal edema seen in our 3 patients. This strongly correlates with previous studies that have linked amantadine, a drug that blocks dopamine reuptake, to reversible corneal edema. "
Etiology and Age Modifies Subjective Visual Function After Cerebral Hemispherectomy.,"To evaluate the add-on effect of manual cyclotorsion error correction by the cornea-marking method over standard small incision lenticule extraction (SMILE) surgery in astigmatic eyes. Consecutive patients (84) who had preoperative myopic astigmatism of -0.75 diopters (D) or more and were seeking surgical refractive correction by SMILE surgery during July 2017 to August 2017 were included in this study and randomized to treatment with standard SMILE surgery (S group: 30 eyes) or cyclotorsion compensated SMILE surgery (CC group: 54 eyes). The visual acuity and refractive outcomes were analyzed preoperatively and postoperatively. Refractive astigmatic changes were analyzed by the Alpins method. The S and CC groups were comparable preoperatively regarding age, manifest spherical equivalent, and manifest refractive cylinder. The mean position-related cyclotorsion degree in the enrolled astigmatic eyes for the S and CC groups was 1.7  2.2 degrees (ranging from 0 to 10 degrees) and 2.19  1.74 degrees (ranging from 0 to 10 degrees), respectively. The mean cylinder was -1.67  0.54 D versus -1.72  0.71 D preoperatively. Six months after treatment, the surgical outcomes in the CC group were significantly better than those of the S group, with a postoperative corrected distance visual acuity of -0.07  0.07 versus 0.016  0.13. A vector analysis of astigmatism also yielded better outcomes in the CC group. However, these 2 groups were statistically similar in spherical equivalent. SMILE surgery combined with cyclotorsion error compensation yielded a significant improvement in surgical outcomes regarding safety, efficiency, and predictability for patients with astigmatism.This is an open-access article distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives License 4.0 (CCBY-NC-ND), where it is permissible to download and share the work provided it is properly cited.

Choroidal Thickness and Associated Factors among Adult Myopia: A Baseline Report from a Medical University Student Cohort.,"Kabuki syndrome (KS) is a rare congenital disorder characterized by multiple systemic anomalies and unique facial characteristics. Here, we present the first case, to the best of our knowledge, of bilateral congenital corneal opacities as an early-onset ocular manifestation of KS associated with a KMT2D gene mutation. The proband is a girl. At birth, bilateral corneal opacities, short fifth fingers, patent ductus arteriosus, absence of the uvula, and an ectopic kidney on the right side were noted. Ophthalmic examinations revealed vascularized, nonhomogeneous opacities in both corneas; to prevent deprivation amblyopia, bilateral corneal transplantations were performed. At 1 year and 10 months of age, she was referred by a general practitioner to our pediatric endocrinologist for failure to thrive. Genetic analysis at that age revealed the presence of a KMT2D gene mutation, and the patient was diagnosed with KS. The clinical diagnosis of KS is challenging because the most remarkable facial features are not evident until early childhood. In this case, bilateral congenital corneal opacities were identified as an early-onset ocular manifestation of KS. KS should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients with bilateral congenital corneal opacities. "
Community-level Association between Clinical Trachoma and Ocular Chlamydia Infection after MASS Azithromycin Distribution in a Mesoendemic Region of Niger.,"Recent years have seen the approval of more than 15 disease-modifying drugs for multiple sclerosis (MS), mainly for its relapsing-remitting form (RRMS). The focus of the MS clinical trials is moving toward clinical trials aimed at progressive patients or based on putatively neuroprotective compounds. Here we reviewed the challenges of this paradigm shift. Progressive MS and neuroprotective drugs trials will both need a change in patients' enrollment criteria, outcome selection, and clinical trials design. Published ocrelizumab Primary Progressive MS data, as well as translational neuroimaging and clinical research suggest that MRI markers of inflammation could be used to enrich progressive MS trials population, albeit with the risk of overestimating the relevance of antiinflammatory therapeutic effects in this population and that conventional MRI-based metrics need to be complemented with volumetric and multiparametric approaches to disease severity quantification. Lastly, regarding statistical design, Bayesian approaches are at last making their way from oncology to neurology improving our ability to evaluate multiple treatments in the same trials' population. Adequate clinical trials design was one of the key factors in the RRMS treatment success story. Multidisciplinary collaborations are needed to adequately plan the progressive MS and restorative therapies trials that lay ahead in the near future. "
Novel ultra-small micelles based on ginsenoside Rb1: a potential nanoplatform for ocular drug delivery.,"IgG4-related ophthalmic disease (IgG4-ROD) is a rare inflammatory disorder often refractory to corticosteroids and prone to recurrence. IgG4-ROD may frequently lack the characteristic histopathological features seen in other organs. Thus, the criteria for diagnosis of IgG4-ROD relies on elevated IgG4 cells seen on biopsied tissue. Proposed threshold levels of IgG4 to diagnose IgG4-ROD are currently based on a limited understanding of this cell type\'s presence in the orbit. This study seeks to describe the population of IgG4 in inflammatory and noninflammatory orbital tissues. A tertiary care center\'s pathology database was searched with keywords ""orbit"" or ""orbital"" from 1995 to 2013. Specimens meeting the selection criteria were evaluated, and regions of highest inflammation were identified and immunostained with IgG4 and CD138 antibodies. Immunohistochemical quantification proceeded as previously established by the international consensus criteria. Eighteen cases without a history of orbital inflammation were included as controls and were evaluated as above. Specimens from 68 inflammatory and 18 noninflammatory orbits met the selection criteria. Pathologist interreader correlation coefficient on quantification was >0.70 (P<0.001). The mean IgG4+/high powered field (HPF) and IgG4+/CD138 was 10.3 and 0.1 in inflammatory tissues and 0.5 and 0.01 in noninflammatory tissues, respectively. The spearman rho correlation coefficient between IgG4/HPF and IgG4+/CD138+ was >0.95 (P<0.0001). The mean IgG4/HPF in our study reached previously proposed threshold values for diagnosis of IgG4-ROD, illustrating the need for further discussion regarding diagnostic criteria of IgG4-ROD. "
Cataract extraction in patients with primary congenital glaucoma.,"To compare equal concentrations (0.5%) of moxifloxacin and gatifloxacin ophthalmic solutions with regard to conjunctival bacterial reduction as well as anterior chamber penetration. One hundred patients were divided into 2 groups. Group A received moxifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution and group B received gatifloxacin 0.5% ophthalmic solution 4 times a day for 3 days before surgery and 5 times with 30min intervals on the day of surgery. Two conjunctival swabs were obtained: one before instillation of antibiotic and the second 30min after instillation of the last antibiotic drop. Specimens were sent for culture and susceptibility testing. At the time of surgery, 0.1mL of aqueous fluid was aspired, and aqueous concentration of fluoroquinolones was identified using reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography assay technique. The most common flora isolated was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (32.9%), followed by Staphylococcus aureus (24.8%) and Corynebacterium diphtheria (19.1%). Moxifloxacin aqueous concentration was higher compared with gatifloxacin [1.750.98 standard deviation (SD) and 0.750.22 SD, respectively]. This 2.3-fold difference in aqueous humor antibiotic concentrations was statistically significant (P0.001). There was significant difference between the means of conjunctival colony-forming unit after antibiotic administration in both the study groups (2.171.54 SD in group A and 1.561.09 SD in group B). Moxifloxacin 0.5% was found to penetrate anterior chamber more than gatifloxacin 0.5%, enforcing its use for prophylaxis before intraocular surgeries. However, gatifloxacin 0.5% eye drops were able to reduce conjunctival bacterial load, more supporting its use before extraocular and refractive surgeries. "
Pupil cerclage technique for treatment of traumatic mydriasis.,"Interferon alpha (IFN-) is a glycoprotein with antitumor, antiviral, and immunomodulatory activity, used widely in the treatment of viral infections (hepatitis B and C, condylomata acuminata, herpes zoster, etc.), hematological disorders (leukemia, multiple myeloma, T cell lymphoma, and essential thrombocythemia), and solid tumors (clear cell carcinoma in the metastatic stage, melanoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cervical neoplasia). Studies have proven the effectiveness of IFN- in the treatment of ophthalmic disorders involving the anterior segment of the eye (conjunctival papilloma, squamous neoplasia, conjunctival mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, Mooren's ulcer, and vernal keratoconjunctivitis) and the posterior segment of the eye (serpiginous choroidopathy, posterior uveitis, pseudophakic and diabetic cystoid macular edema, and proliferative diabetic retinopathy). The therapy with IFN- remains a promising alternative in cases of a failing response to conventional therapy, helping to maintain or improve visual acuity, prevent vision loss, and ameliorate the prognosis of the patient. However, clinicians who decide to use IFN- in their patients must be aware of general and ophthalmological side effects and inform their patients to undergo a systemic evaluation such as a physical examination, blood and serological tests, and a chest X-ray before the beginning of treatment. This review presents the current knowledge of the use of IFN-, its efficacy, and properties in ophthalmological diseases, and thus may encourage clinicians to administer this drug as a treatment modality in ophthalmological diseases in the future.

"A triad of retinal signs in Alport syndrome: The 'stair-case' fovea, choroidal thinning and peripheral schisis.","To determine the anti-inflammatory effects of dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ), a nuclear factor-B (NF-B) inhibitor, on endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) in rats. EIU was induced by a subcutaneous injection of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in Lewis rats. DHMEQ was injected intraperitoneally concurrently with the LPS. Aqueous humor was collected 24h after the LPS injection. Isolated peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) were exposed to LPS with or without DHMEQ to determine the production of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1. DHMEQ significantly reduced the number of infiltrating cells, and the concentrations of proteins, TNF-, and IL-6 in the aqueous humor. DHMEQ suppressed the production of TNF-, IL-6, and MCP-1 from PECs. Immunochemistry revealed a reduction in the translocation of the NF-B p65 into the nuclei in DHMEQ-exposed PECs. The results indicate that DHMEQ has anti-inflammatory effects on EIU and may be a promising agent to treat intraocular inflammation. "
Health economic analysis of a cluster-randomised trial (OptiBIRTH) designed to increase rates of vaginal birth after caesarean section.,"Fast chemical synaptic transmission is a major form of neuronal communication in the nervous system of mammals. Another important, but very different, form of intercellular communication is volume transmission, which is a slower non-synaptic signaling. The amino acid glutamate is the most abundant excitatory neurotransmitter in the nervous system, which mediates both synaptic and non-synaptic signaling via ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors. Intriguingly, neurons establish glutamatergic synapses also with oligodendrocyte precursor cells (NG2<sup>+</sup> -glia). Moreover, neuronal activity and glutamate receptors play an important role in the development and functionality of oligodendrocytes and their precursors in vivo. Yet, molecular characteristics and functional significance of neuron-glia synapses remain poorly understood, and it is unclear how glutamate receptors mediate the effects of neuronal activity on the oligodendrocyte lineage cells. In this review, we discuss what is known with regard to synaptic and non-synaptic glutamatergic signaling between neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells, what can be suggested based on the current state of knowledge, and what is fully unknown and requires new research.

Comparison of Clinical Results and Pathological Examinations Between Locally Synthesized Bone-derived Hydroxyapatite and Medpor Orbital Implants in Animal Models.,"The mechanisms underlying the finding of reduced child mortality in communities with biannual treatment with azithromycin remain unclear. We determined if there was a difference in morbidity in a cohort of children ages 1 to 36 months, residing in communities randomized to biannual treatment of pre-school age children with azithromycin or placebo. 30 villages in Kilosa Tanzania were randomly assigned to receive biannual treatment of all children ages 1 to 59 months with either azithromycin (20/mg/kg single dose) or placebo. Children who were age 1 to 35 months and participated in the baseline survey were enrolled in this cohort study and followed prospectively for two years. Children were monitored every six months for signs and symptoms of diarrheal disease, acute respiratory illness, and anemia. Mixed effect models that include age, time, treatment arm, and the interaction of treatment arm and time as independent predictors were used to evaluate differences between children by treatment assignment over time. There was no difference in rates of diarrhea, fever, or anemia by treatment arm at baseline and at all phases of follow up. The decline over time in reported cough was statistically significant in the children residing in the azithromycin communities, but not in the placebo communities. Once adjusting for clustering and age, the difference in decline between the two treatment arms was not significant, p=.09. A beneficial effect of azithromycin treatment on morbidity outcomes was not evident at six monthly surveys. "
Protective effects of chebulic acid from <i>Terminalia chebula</i> Retz. against <i>t</i>-BHP-induced oxidative stress by modulations of Nrf2 and its related enzymes in HepG2 cells.,"The aim of the study is to evaluate the relationship between functional defects shown by cluster analysis of computerized visual field and anatomic defects from optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex examination in ocular hypertension or eyes affected by glaucoma. 205 eyes affected by ocular hypertension (intraocular pressure>22mmHg) or early stage glaucoma were enrolled. The age of the patients ranged from 26 to 87years (average: 61.831.54years). Computerized 30 visual field (Octopus G1x Dynamic strategy) and optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex (I-Vue Optovue) analyses were performed for each eye selected; 68 eyes were tested and retested from two to seven times for a total of 320 visual fields and 320 optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex examinations. The visual field was considered abnormal with a mean defect<-2 and loss variance>6. The optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex was considered abnormal with a significant focal loss volume (p<5%) and/or a significant thinning of total, superior, or inferior thickness (p<5%). Four different groups of examinations were created according to the results of visual field and ganglion cell complex: normal visual field and normal ganglion cell complex (group 1), abnormal visual field and abnormal ganglion cell complex (group 2), normal visual field and abnormal ganglion cell complex (group 3), and abnormal visual field and normal ganglion cell complex (group 4). The cluster analysis of visual fields (EyeSuite software Interzeag CH) was performed only in the visual field of group 3, and the correlation between cluster values and topographical changes at optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex was analyzed. The results of the ganglion cell complex and visual field examinations matched 247 (77.19%) times. In 143 cases, the examinations belonged to group 1, in 104 to group 2, in 23 to group 3, and, finally, in 50 to group 4. The visual field cluster analysis performed on group 3 showed that the correlation between optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex and visual field cluster analysis defects was 100% (both the exams altered). In 72% of them, there was also a topographical correspondence between the visual field and optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex defects. In the early stages of glaucoma, the visual field cluster analysis seems to be useful to detect some focal defects that can be otherwise underestimated when globally considering the visual field. In group 3, where the conventional analysis of visual field was normal while the optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex exam was abnormal, the visual field cluster analysis showed a topographical correlation with optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex defects in more than 70% of the examinations performed. In addition, the patients with abnormal visual field and normal optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex were older than those with normal visual field and abnormal optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex (66.443.51 vs 57.045.96 years, p<0.001 (0.0002)). These results confirm that the reliability of a visual field examination is subjective and decreases with age because of its difficulty and the personal compliance of the patient toward this examination.

Endogenous <i>Clostridium perfringens</i> Panophthalmitis with Potential Entry Port from Diverticulitis Exacerbated by Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy.,"Early-onset photoreceptor dystrophies are a major cause of irreversible visual impairment in children and young adults. This clinically heterogeneous group of disorders can be caused by mutations in many genes. Nevertheless, to date, 30%-40% of cases remain genetically unexplained. In view of expanding therapeutic options, it is essential to obtain a molecular diagnosis in these patients as well. In this study, we aimed to identify the genetic cause in two siblings with genetically unexplained retinal disease. Whole exome sequencing was performed to identify the causative variants in two siblings in whom a single pathogenic variant in TULP1 was found previously. Patients were clinically evaluated, including assessment of the medical history, slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and ophthalmoscopy. In addition, a functional analysis of the putative splice variant in TULP1 was performed using a midigene assay. Clinical assessment showed a typical early-onset photoreceptor dystrophy in both the patients. Whole exome sequencingidentified two pathogenic variants in TULP1, a c.1445G>A (p.(Arg482Gln)) missense mutation and an intronic c.718+23G>A variant. Segregation analysis confirmed that both siblings were compound heterozygous for the TULP1 c.718+23G>A and c.1445G>A variants, while the unaffected parents were heterozygous. The midigene assay for the c.718+23G>A variant confirmed an elongation of exon 7 leading to a frameshift. Here, we report the first near-exon RNA splice variant that is not present in a consensus splice site sequence in TULP1, which was found in a compound heterozygous manner with a previously described pathogenic TULP1 variant in two patients with an early-onset photoreceptor dystrophy. We provide proof of pathogenicity for this splice variant by performing an in vitro midigene splice assay, and highlight the importance of analysis of noncoding regions beyond the noncanonical splice sites in patients with inherited retinal diseases.

Characterization of CD4+ T cells primed and boosted by MHCII primary uveal melanoma cell-based vaccines.,"Cosmetics and personal care products are ubiquitous. Consumer pressure arising from recent episodes of products found to be unsafe has led to new policy proposals to modernize cosmetics regulation in the United States. We reviewed contemporary cosmetics regulation and collected major past and current policy proposals relating to cosmetics regulation with a focus on public health controversies. Under a structure originally established in 1938 that places regulation of cosmetics under the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), cosmetics manufacturers in the United States are not required to register their products or forward consumer complaints to the FDA, leading to broad under-reporting of adverse events. The FDA has limited authority to mandate product recalls. The existing FDA database system that collects adverse events related to cosmetics has limited public health utility. Current proposals for new cosmetics regulations seek to establish better systems for data collection and mandatory manufacturer registrations funded by cosmetic manufacturers. Additional policy changes could include a premarket review process for cosmeceuticals (cosmetics that make drug-like claims) and more advanced real-world data safety monitoring tools. With continued consumer concern and several recent cosmetic-related public health controversies, the FDA should be given more resources and broader authority to protect consumer safety. "
Chinese Global Health Diplomacy in Africa: Opportunities and Challenges.,"In the retina, diverse functions of neuronal gap junctions (GJs) have been established. However, the distribution and function of vascular GJs are less clear. Here in the mouse retina whole mounts, we combined structural immunohistochemical analysis and a functional assessment of cellular coupling with a GJ-permeable tracer Neurobiotin to determine distribution patterns of three major vascular connexins. We found that Cx43 was expressed in punctate fashion on astroglia, surrounding all types of blood vessels and in continuous string-like structures along endothelial cell contacts in specialized regions of the vascular tree. Specifically, these Cx43-positive strings originated at the finest capillaries and extended toward the feeding artery. As this structural arrangement promoted strong and exclusive coupling of pericytes and endothelial cells along the corresponding branch, we termed this region a ""vascular relay."" Cx40 expression was found predominantly along the endothelial cell contacts of the primary arteries and did not overlap with Cx43-positive strings. At their occupied territories, Cx43 and Cx40 clustered with tight junctions and, to a lesser extent, with adhesion contacts, both key elements of the blood-retina barrier. Finally, Cx37 puncta were associated with the entire surface of both mural and endothelial cells across all regions of the vascular tree. This combinatorial analysis of vascular connexins and identification of the vascular relay region will serve as a structural foundation for future studies of neurovascular signaling in health and disease.

Nasal Polyposis: More than a Chronic Inflammatory Disorder-A Disease of Mechanical Dysfunction-The So Paulo Position.,"To assess the association of Eph-receptor tyrosinekinase-type A2 (EphA2) gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to age-related cataract (ARC) among ethnic Han Chinese from Hubei Province. 280 patients with cortical ARC and 200 healthy controls were recruited. Polymorphisms at four loci (rs3768293, rs3754334, rs477558 and rs7548209) of the EphA2 gene were detected by PCR-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RELP) assay. Allelic and genotypic frequencies of the two groups were compared. Compared with the control group, the AA genotype of rs3768293 locus was more common, while the AC genotype was much rarer (P< 0.05). No significant difference was found in allelic and genotypic frequencies of rs3754334 locus between the two groups (P> 0.05). The AA genotype of the rs477558 locus was more common in the patient group, while the AG genotype was much rarer (P< 0.05). The genotype GG of the rs7548209 locus was more common in the patient group, while the CG genotype was rarer (P< 0.05), though no significant difference in allelic or haplotypic frequencies between the two groups (P> 0.05). Polymorphisms of rs477558, rs7548209 and rs3768293 loci of the EphA2 gene are associated with susceptibility to ARC among ethnic Han Chinese from Hubei province. "
Bilateral Simultaneous Endoscopic Dacryocystorhinostomy: Outcome and Impact on the Quality of Life of the Patients.,"To identify the mutation type of non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 (MYH9) gene and investigate the clinical features of a pedigree affected with MYH9 gene-related disease. Peripheral blood samples of the proband and his family members were collected. Routine blood tests were performed, which included platelet counting and Wright's staining to observe the granulocyte inclusions and giant platelets. PCR was used to amplify exons 2, 17, 27, 31, 39 and 41 of the MYH9 gene, and the mutation site was determined by Sanger sequencing. All patients from the pedigree presented a typical triad of thrombocytopenia, giant platelets, and inclusion bodies in leukocytes. In addition, two patients had nephritis and cataract. All affected members carried a heterozygous missense mutation of c.5521G>A (p.glu1841Lys) in exon 39 of the MYH9 gene. The same mutation was not found among healthy members of the pedigree and the controls. The c.5521G>A (p.Glu1841Lys) mutation in the MYH9 gene probably underlies the MYH9-related disease in this pedigree. "
Mismatch Negativity in Children: Reference Values.,"The present study aimed to evaluate the lamina cribrosa thickness (LCT), lamina cribrosa depth (LCD), subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thicknesses, peripapillary choroidal thickness (PCT), and retina nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). This single-center, case-control study included 45 OSAS patients and 43 age-and sex-matched healthy controls. Only the right eyes of the patients and controls were included. Each participant underwent a comprehensive ophthalmic assessment including slit lamp examination (biomicroscopy), stereoscopic fundus examination, and intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement. The SD-OCT measurements were also performed in both patients and controls. The mean ages of the patients (females, 55.6%) and controls (females, 51.2%) were 50.099.7years and 50.304.2years, respectively. The groups were similar in terms of age and gender. Evaluation of the study parameters revealed that there were no significant differences between the OSAS patients and controls regarding IOP, RNFL thickness, subfoveal and parafoveal choroidal thicknesses, and PCT. A significant difference was found between the OSAS patients and controls regarding LCT but not regarding LCD. The mean LCT values were 213.3830.7m and 300.4942.6m for the OSAS patients and controls, respectively (p0.001). The results of the present study indicated that the lamina cribrosa was significantly thinner in the OSAS patients than in the controls. In our opinion, this finding should be supported by large-scale studies and the reason underlying the thinning of the lamina cribrosa in OSAS patients should be investigated physiopathologically. "
Association between the CD40 rs1883832 polymorphism and Graves' disease risk: a meta-analysis.,"Spatial neglect is asymmetric orienting and action after a brain lesion, causing functional disability. It is common after a stroke; however, it is vastly underdocumented and undertreated. This article addresses the implementation gap in identifying and treating spatial neglect, to reduce disability and improve healthcare costs and burden. Professional organizations published recommendations to implement spatial neglect care. Physicians can lead an interdisciplinary team: functionally relevant spatial neglect assessment, evidence-based spatial retraining, and integrated spatial and vision interventions can optimize outcomes. Research also strongly suggests spatial neglect adversely affects motor systems. Spatial neglect therapy might thus ""kick-start"" rehabilitation and improve paralysis recovery. Clinicians can implement new techniques to detect spatial neglect and lead interdisciplinary teams to promote better, integrated spatial neglect care. Future studies of brain imaging biomarkers to detect spatial neglect, and real-world applicability of prism adaptation treatment, are needed. "
Long-term Clinical Results of Vitrectomy and Scleral Buckling in Treatment of Rhegmatogenous Retinal Detachment.,"Effective migration of dendritic cells into the lymphatic system organs is the prerequisite for a functional dendritic cell vaccine. We have previously developed a porous silicon microparticle (PSM)-based therapeutic dendritic cell vaccine (Nano-DC vaccine) where PSM serves both as the vehicle for antigen peptides and an adjuvant. Here, we analyzed parameters that determined dendritic cell uptake of PSM particles and Nano-DC vaccine accumulation in lymphatic tissues in a murine model of HER2-positive breast cancer. Our study revealed a positive correlation between sphericity of the PSM particles and their cellular uptake by circulating dendritic cells. In addition, the intravenously administered vaccines accumulated more in the spleens and inguinal lymph nodes, while the intradermally inoculated vaccines got enriched in the popliteal lymph nodes. Furthermore, mice with large tumors received more vaccines in the lymph nodes than those with small to medium size tumors. Information from this study will provide guidance on design and optimization of future therapeutic cancer vaccines. "
Human iPSC-Derived Retinas Recapitulate the Fetal CRB1 CRB2 Complex Formation and Demonstrate that Photoreceptors and Mller Glia Are Targets of AAV5.,"This retrospective study aimed at comparing the efficacy and safety of toric and spherical orthokeratology lenses in the treatment of patients with moderate to high astigmatism. Fifty adolescents with myopia and moderate to high astigmatism (1.50 D) who underwent consecutive orthokeratology treatment for at least 1 year were included in this study. The toric group comprised 25 subjects (25 eyes, 11 M, 14 F; age, 10.671.46 years) who were fitted with toric orthokeratology lenses. The spherical group comprised 25 subjects (25 subjects, 11 M, 14 F; age, 11.451.63 years) who were fitted with traditional spherical orthokeratology lenses as a control. Corneal topography, visual acuity, axial length, and slit-lamp examinations were performed to determine the differences between these two groups. The corneal tangential difference mapping was conducted between baseline and every subsequent visit to calculate the magnitude of lens decentration. The corrective effect of ortho-K lens was measured by using the corneal axial difference map. The mean decentration and its vertical vector were significantly less in the toric group than in the spherical group after 1 month of lens wear. In toric group, the corneal astigmatism decreased from 1.850.31 D at baseline to 1.450.85 D after the first month of wear. There was a significant linear correlation between the change in corneal astigmatism and lens decentration in the toric group from 1 month to 1 year (<i>Y</i>=3.268<i>X</i>+<i></i>0.9182, <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>=0.5035, <i>p</i> < 0.0001 (<i>X</i>: lens decentration; <i>Y</i>: astigmatic changes)). There were no significant differences in the post-OK uncorrected visual acuity, myopia control, or ocular health between the toric and spherical groups. The toric orthokeratology lens design can effectively reduce the lens decentration magnitude and CJ180 from 1-month visit to 12-month visit of patients with high or moderate corneal astigmatism. Meanwhile, there was no significant difference in visual acuity, myopia control, and ocular health throughout 12 months. However, the effect of toric lenses on corneal morphology may be susceptible to lens positioning. "

Uncontrolled experimentation is not an option for open minds: Ethical research is the answer.,"To investigate visual performances after a unilateral or bilateral implantation of enlarged depth-of-focus intraocular lens in patients with cataract. In this prospective study, uneventful phacoemulsification and TECNIS Symfony intraocular lens implantation were performed in 20 eyes of 17 patients. At postoperative 1, 4, and 12weeks, the logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution visual acuity at far, intermediate, and near distances and the spherical equivalent in manifest refraction and automated refraction were measured. A questionnaire was used to investigate glare, spectacle dependency, and satisfaction at 12weeks. The mean numerical error and mean absolute error were compared between intraocular lens formulas to assess the best-fit formula. The logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution visual acuity significantly improved to 0.02 at far, 0.02 at intermediate, and 0.27 at near distances at 12weeks (<i>p</i> < 0.05). Spherical equivalent was -0.79D on automated refraction and was significantly lower than -0.26D measured on manifest refraction. Patients' satisfaction score was 9.06, 8.94, and 6.65 for far, intermediate, and near distances, respectively. Near glasses were required in 5 patients and 2 patients complained of photic phenomenon. Visual performances were not significantly different between bilateral and unilateral implanted patients. No patients reported bilateral imbalance due to unilateral surgery. The mean numerical error was closest to 0D using the Barrett Universal II formula. The mean absolute error was not significantly different between these formulas. Unilateral or bilateral implantation of the enlarged depth-of-focus intraocular lens seems to be equally effective in improving visual performances in patients with cataract. "
Evaluation of the Ocular Surface Disease Index Questionnaire as a Discriminative Test for Clinical Findings in Dry Eye Disease Patients.,"To model a community-based telescreening program for diabetic retinopathy (DR) in Iran and to implement a pilot project at the Iranian Diabetes Society (IDS) branch in a Tehran suburb. In this mixed model study, a web application called the ""Iranian Retinopathy Teleophthalmology Screening (IRTOS)"" was launched. The educational course for DR screening was established for general practitioners (GPs). Registered patients in IDS branch were recalled for fundus photography; images were transferred to the reading center via IRTOS to be graded by GPs, and patients were informed about the results via mobile messaging. All images were independently reviewed by a retina specialist as the gold standard. Patients who required further assessment were referred to an eye hospital. Overall, 604 subjects with diabetes were screened; of these, 50% required referral. The sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis of any stage of DR by trained GPs were 82.8% and 86.2%, respectively, in comparison to the gold standard. The corresponding values for detecting any stage of diabetic macular edema (DME) were 63.5% and 96.6%, respectively. Telescreening was an effective method for detecting DR in a Tehran suburb. This screening model demonstrated its capacity for promoting diabetic eye care services at the national level. However, the sensitivity for detecting DME needs to be improved by modifying the referral pathway and promoting the skill of GPs. "
Efficacy and safety of intravitreal drug injections using a short 34-gauge needle.,"Herpes simplex virus type-2 (HSV-2) is a common cause of genital infections throughout the world. Currently no prophylactic vaccine or therapeutic cure exists against the virus that establishes a latent infection for the life of the host. Intravaginal microbivac is a developing out-of-the-box strategy that combines instant microbicidal effects with future vaccine-like benefits. We have recently shown that our uniquely designed zinc oxide tetrapod nanoparticles (ZOTEN) show strong microbivac efficacy against HSV-2 infection in a murine model of genital infection. In our attempts to further understand the antiviral and immune bolstering effects of ZOTEN microbivac and to develop ZOTEN as a platform for future live virus vaccines, we tested a ZOTEN/HSV-2 cocktail and found that prior incubation of HSV-2 with ZOTEN inhibits the ability of the virus to infect vaginal tissue in female Balb/c mice and blocks virus shedding as judged by plaque assays. Quite interestingly, the ZOTEN-neutralized virions elicit a local immune response that is highly comparable with the HSV-2 infection alone with reduced inflammation and clinical manifestations of disease. Information provided by our study will pave the way for the further development of ZOTEN as a microbivac and a future platform for live virus vaccines. "
Glycemic Control and Long-term Complications in Pediatric Onset Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus: A Single-center Experience from Northern India.,"The primary cilium is a hair-like surface-exposed organelle of the eukaryotic cell that decodes a variety of signals - such as odorants, light and Hedgehog morphogens - by altering the local concentrations and activities of signalling proteins. Signalling within the cilium is conveyed through a diverse array of second messengers, including conventional signalling molecules (such as cAMP) and some unusual intermediates (such as sterols). Diffusion barriers at the ciliary base establish the unique composition of this signalling compartment, and cilia adapt their proteome to signalling demands through regulated protein trafficking. Much progress has been made on the molecular understanding of regulated ciliary trafficking, which encompasses not only exchanges between the cilium and the rest of the cell but also the shedding of signalling factors into extracellular vesicles.

"Association between socioeconomic status, belonging to an ethnic minority and obstructive sleep apnea: a systematic review of the literature.","Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a common phenotype in multiple inherited retinal dystrophies (IRD). Disease gene identification can assist the clinical diagnosis of IRD patients for better clinical management, treatment and counseling. In this study, we aimed to delineate and characterize the disease-causing mutations in Chinese familial and sporadic patients with initial diagnosis of RP. Four unrelated Chinese families and 118 sporadic RP patients were recruited for whole exome sequencing analysis. A total of 5 reported and 3 novel USH2A mutations were identified in four Chinese probands. The probands and their family members showed typical RP features and mild to severe hearing impairment, confirming the diagnosis of Usher syndrome 2 (USH). Moreover, 11 sporadic RP patients were identified to carry the compound heterozygous mutations in the USH2A gene, confirming the diagnosis of USH2. The patients carried the truncating mutations had a younger age of first visit than the patients carried only the missense mutations (p=0.017). In summary, this study revealed 8 novel USH2A variants in Chinese familial and sporadic RP patients, assuring that whole exome sequencing analysis is an adequate strategy to facilitate the clinical diagnosis of USH from the sporadic RP patients.

Modified endoscopic diving technique without the traditional irrigation system in endoscopic cranial base surgery: Technical Note.,"Aripiprazole is an interesting psychoactive compound acting as a dopamine D2 partial agonist, serotonin 5-HT(1A) partial agonist and serotonin 5-HT(2A) antagonist. Aripiprazole possesses a well-documented efficacy in the treatment of both positive and negative psychotic symptoms. However, this medication may be rarely associated with the onset of hiccup. Here, we present the case of aripiprazole-induced hiccup in a young inpatient at his first psychiatric admission together with a review of the current literature about this topic. The possible etiology underlying the emergence of hiccups together with the clinical implications of this adverse event are discussed. "
Determinants of reoperation after decompressive craniectomy in patients with traumatic brain injury: A comparative study.,"There are fundamental differences in the structures of outer segments between rod and cone photoreceptor cells in the vertebrate retina. Visual pigments are the only essential membrane proteins that differ between rod and cone outer segments, making it likely that they contribute to these structural differences. Human rhodopsin is N-glycosylated on Asn-2 and Asn-15, whereas human red and green cone opsins (hOPSR and hOPSG, respectively) are N-glycosylated at Asn-34. Here, utilizing a monoclonal antibody (7G8 mAB) we demonstrate that hOPSR and hOPSG from human retina also are O-glycosylated with full occupancy. We determined that 7G8 mAB recognizes the N-terminal sequence 21DSTQSSIF28 of hOPSR and hOPSG from extracts of human retina, but only after their O-glycans have been removed with O-glycosidase treatment, thus revealing this post-translational modification of red and green cone opsins. In addition, we show that hOPSR and hOPSG from human retina are recognized by jacalin, a lectin that binds to O-glycans, preferentially to Gal-GalNAc. Next, we confirmed the presence of O-glycans on OPSR and OPSG from several vertebrate species, including mammals, birds and amphibians. Finally, the analysis of bovine OPSR by mass spectrometry identified an O-glycan on Ser-22, a residue that is semi-conserved (Ser or Thr) among vertebrate OPSR and OPSG. These results suggest that O-glycosylation is a fundamental feature of red and green cone opsins which may be relevant to their function or to cone cell development, and that differences in this post-translational modification also could contribute to the different morphologies of rod and cone photoreceptors.

"Neurodevelopmental Outcomes Following Intravitreal Bevacizumab Therapy for Retinopathy of Prematurity: a prospective, case-control study.","Long non-coding RNA H19 has been implicated in tumor angiogenesis. However, whether H19 regulates the progression of corneal neovascularization (CNV) is unclear. This study aimed to determine the function of H19 in CNV and its possible molecular mechanism. Here, we found that the H19 levels were remarkably increased in vascularized corneas and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)-treated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). <i>In vitro</i> , H19 upregulation promoted proliferation, migration, tube formation and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) expression in HUVECs, and it was found to downregulate microRNA-29c (miR-29c) expression. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that H19 mediated the above effects by binding directly to miR-29c. In addition, miR-29c expression was markedly reduced in vascularized corneas and its expression also decreased in bFGF-treated HUVECs <i>in vitro</i> MiR-29c targeted the 3' untranslated region (3'-UTR) of VEGFA and decreased its expression. These data suggest that H19 can enhance CNV progression by inhibiting miR-29c, which negatively regulates VEGFA. This novel regulatory axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for CNV. "
Spatial intratumor heterogeneity in uveal melanoma: Tumor cell subtypes with a presumed invasive potential exhibit a particular epigenetic staining reaction.,"Carteolol, a non-selective beta-antagonist with a potential risk of severe bronchial constriction in patients with asthma, is one of the most commonly prescribed medication for managing ocular pressure in glaucoma. We present a case of a 24-year-old woman with a history of atopy but no known asthma who presented an insidious onset of clinical manifestations compatible with drug-induced asthma after the initiation of carteolol for ocular hypertension control. The patient developed progressive chest tightness and dyspnoea for 2months before the pulmonary function test revealed a positive bronchoprovocation response. She reported significant improvement of respiratory symptoms within 2weeks after the discontinuation of carteolol, and a negative provocation response was later confirmed by repeat pulmonary function test. In conclusion, eye drops with non-selective beta-antagonising effect can induce asthmatic symptoms in patients without a previous diagnosis of asthma and should be administered with caution in patients with associated risk factors.

Choroidal Vascular Changes in Arteritic and Non-arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy.,"A 17-year-old man presented to the emergency department with complaints of retro-orbital pain of the left eye and an altitudinal visual field defect for 2 weeks. Fundus examination revealed ipsilateral hyperaemic optic disc oedema, and the patient was admitted with the presumptive diagnosis of left optic neuritis. Subsequently, during follow-up, the patient developed a retinal granulomatous lesion in the superior temporal arcade with vitritis and fibrotic strands extending to the mid-periphery. Serum antibodies detection by ELISA and aqueous humour immunoblot were positive for <i>Toxocara canis</i> Medical therapy with albendazole and oral steroids was instituted with satisfactory results. One year later, a new macular lesion developed with consequent vision loss. "
Retrospective Validation of the Postnatal Growth and Retinopathy of Prematurity (G-ROP) Criteria in a Japanese Cohort.,"To assess the effects of decentration and tilt at different orientations on the optical quality of a rotationally asymmetric multifocal intraocular lens (IOL). Shandong Eye Institute, Qingdao, China. Experimental study. A rotationally asymmetric multifocal IOL (SBL-3) was tested using standardized optical bench testing. The optical quality was quantified using the modulation transfer function (MTF), through-focus MTF, and images of the United States Air Force Target test at apertures of 3.0mm and 4.5mm. The multifocal IOL was measured while it was centered, decentered by 0.3mm and 0.5mm, and then tilted by 3 degrees and 5 degrees at near-horizontal (near vision zone), distance-horizontal (distance vision zone), and vertical orientations of the long axis of the multifocal IOL. The optical performance was better at the aperture of 4.5mm than at 3.0mm for the centered multifocal IOL. The optical quality was improved at near focus and decreased at distance focus for the near-horizontal decentration, contrary to the status for the distance-horizontal decentration, with a more obvious tendency at the 3.0mm aperture than at 4.5mm. For the near-horizontal tilting, the optical quality at near focus was more significantly deteriorated than distance focus, opposite to that for the distance-horizontal tilting, with a more distinct tendency at a 4.5mm aperture than at 3.0mm. The optical quality of the asymmetric multifocal IOL was sensitive to and varied significantly after decentration and tilt at specific directions. The decentration induced increased or decreased optical quality, whereas tilt just yielded decreased optical quality. "
High rate of recurrence of herpes zoster-related ocular disease after phacoemulsification cataract surgery.,"Collagen cross-linking (CXL) is an evolving procedure that enhances the biomechanical rigidity of the cornea and can slow or halt ectatic disease. CXL requires delivery of 5.4J/cm<sup>2</sup> of ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation to a cornea saturated with riboflavin in order to induce cross-link formation. The conventional CXL procedure achieves this fluence by exposing the cornea to a 3mW/cm<sup>2</sup> UVA lamp for 30min; however, some surgeons have proposed accelerated protocols which achieve the same fluence in a shorter period of time by using a higher power light source. Whether accelerated protocols are as effective in arresting ectasia as the established conventional procedure remains unclear. Accordingly, this study will systematically review and synthesise the evidence on accelerated CXL and compare it to the conventional approach across an array of clinical outcomes. We will search 16 electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library, from inception to February 1, 2019. We will include all randomised controlled trials comparing accelerated and conventional CXL for any corneal ectatic disease. Two reviewers will independently screen search results to identify eligible articles, complete data collection, and conduct quality assessment. The quality of individual trials will be assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. Our primary outcome will be the change in maximal keratometry (K<sub>max</sub>) at 12months following treatment. Additional outcomes will include: incidence of disease progression, incidence of serious adverse events, as well as change in K<sub>max</sub> at longest follow-up, mean stromal demarcation line depth, mean uncorrected distance visual acuity, mean corrected distance visual acuity, mean K<sub>max</sub>, mean endothelial cell density, mean central corneal thickness, mean spherical equivalent, mean intraocular pressure, and mean corneal power, at 12months following treatment. We will calculate relative risks and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dichotomous outcomes and weighted mean differences and corresponding 95% CIs for continuous outcomes. Prespecified subgroup analyses will be performed to investigate heterogeneity. We will rate the overall quality of evidence using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. This review will provide a comprehensive evaluation of the evidence on accelerated and conventional CXL approaches and serve to inform clinical practice, medical device design, and future research. Evaluating variations of the CXL protocol aimed at reducing treatment duration is of critical importance and a prerequisite to expanding treatment availability to more patients.

Trace amine-associated receptor 1 agonism promotes wakefulness without impairment of cognition in Cynomolgus macaques.,"Corneal biomechanical properties are important for the diagnosis of corneal diseases, individualized design and prognosis of corneal surgery. Clinical available devices such as Ocular Response Analyzer (ORA) and Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology (Corvis ST) can provide corneal biomechanics related parameters, while corneal elastic modulus cannot be extracted directly from them at present. The aim of this study is to suggest a method to determine corneal elastic modulus based on the results of Corvis ST test according to Reissner's theory on the relation between stress and small displacement in shallow spherical shell. Five rabbits (10 eyes) and 10 healthy humans (20 eyes) were measured with Corvis ST to obtain the normal range of corneal elastic modulus. Results showed Corneal elastic modulus of rabbit was 0.16MPa to 0.35MPa, human corneal elastic modulus was 0.16-0.30MPa. Rabbit corneas were also measured at different intraocular pressures (IOP), and results showed corneal elastic modulus, first applanation time (A1T) and stiffness parameter (SP-A1) were positively correlated with IOP. Deformation amplitude (DA), the second applanations time (A2T), and peak distance (PD) were negatively correlated with IOP. Finite element method was used to simulate the Corvis measurements according to the calculated elastic modulus and the simulated corneal apical displacements were agreement with experimental results in general. The method to determine corneal elastic modulus based on Corvis test according to the relationship between force and displacements of shallow spherical shell is convenient and effective. "
CSF oligoclonal bands and normal appearing white matter periventricular damage in patients with clinically isolated syndrome suggestive of MS.,"Whether face and object recognition are dissociated in prosopagnosia continues to be debated: a recent review highlighted deficiencies in prior studies regarding the evidence for such a dissociation. Our goal was to study cohorts with acquired and developmental prosopagnosia with a complementary battery of tests of object recognition that address prior limitations, as well as evaluating for residual effects of object expertise. We studied 15 subjects with acquired and 12 subjects with developmental prosopagnosia on three tests: the Old/New Tests, the Cambridge Bicycle Memory Test, and the Expertise-adjusted Test of Car Recognition. Most subjects with developmental prosopagnosia were normal on the Old/New Tests: for acquired prosopagnosia, subjects with occipitotemporal lesions often showed impairments while those with anterior temporal lesions did not. Ten subjects showed a putative classical dissociation between the Cambridge Face and Bicycle Memory Tests, seven of whom had normal reaction times. Both developmental and acquired groups showed reduced car recognition on the expertise-adjusted test, though residual effects of expertise were still evident. Two subjects with developmental prosopagnosia met criteria for normal object recognition across all tests. We conclude that strong evidence for intact object recognition can be found in a few subjects but the majority show deficits, particularly those with the acquired form. Both acquired and developmental forms show residual but reduced object expertise effects. "
Hexahistidine-metal assemblies: A promising drug delivery system.,"Two hundred twenty-two nanometers ultraviolet (UV) light produced by a krypton-chlorine excimer lamp is harmful to bacterial cells but not skin. However, the effects of 222-nm UV light exposure to the eye are not fully known. We evaluated acute corneal damage induced by 222- and 254-nm UV light in albino rats. Under deep anesthesia, 6-week-old Sprague-Dawley albino rats were exposed to UV light. The exposure levels of corneal radiation were 30, 150, and 600mJ/cm<sup>2</sup>. Epithelial defects were detected by staining with uorescein. Superficial punctate keratitis developed in corneas exposed to more than 50mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of UV light, and erosion was observed in corneas exposed to 600mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of UV light. Hematoxylin and eosin staining also showed corneal epithelial defects in eyes exposed to 254-nm UV light. However, no damage developed in corneas exposed to 222-nm UV light. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimer-positive cells were observed only in normal corneas and those exposed to 254-nm UV light. Although some epithelial cells were stained weakly in normal corneas, squamous epithelial cells were stained moderately, and the epithelial layer that was detached from the cornea exposed to 600mJ/cm<sup>2</sup> of light was stained intensely in corneas exposed to 254-nm UV light. In the current study, no corneal damage was induced by 222-nm UV light, which suggested that 222-nm UV light may not harm rat eyes within the energy range and may be useful for sterilizing or preventing infection in the future.

Unbiased Pathogen Detection and Host Gene Profiling for Conjunctivitis.,"Purpose/Aim: This study evaluated the efficacy of topical 0.1% tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension for treating chronic allergic conjunctival disease with and without atopic dermatitis. This study was conducted as a prospective observational post-market survey. Our large-scale study protocol was accepted by the Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Agency in Japan and included patients who were prescribed topical tacrolimus for the treatment of chronic allergic conjunctival disease from May 2008 to Aug 2010 in Japan. Topical tacrolimus was instilled 2 times daily for 6months. The primary endpoint was the change from baseline in papillae-limbus-cornea clinical signs score (based on the presence of papillae, giant papillae, Trantas' dots, limbal swelling, and corneal epithelial signs). Remission rate following topical tacrolimus treatment was investigated using generalized estimating equations. A total of 1821 subjects were included in the analyses. Six months into treatment, 83.0% and 87.7% of subjects with and without atopic dermatitis, respectively, were in remission (based on the papillae-limbus-cornea grading score). Topical tacrolimus treatment was equally effective in improving papillae-limbus-cornea grading scores from baseline in both study groups after 6months of treatment. Additionally, the odds ratio for remission increased over time. The concomitant use of topical steroids improved papillae-limbus-cornea grading scores, including papillary signs with a statistically significant, but low odds ratio. Tacrolimus ophthalmic suspension is useful for treating chronic allergic conjunctival disease with and without atopic dermatitis. Clinical response to local tacrolimus therapy is dependent upon treatment duration. "
Swept-Source Optical Coherence Tomography for Evaluating the Lamina Cribrosa A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.,"The aim of this study was to assess the effect of vitreous reflux and its amount on short-term intraocular pressure after intravitreal injection of ranibizumab. The study included 316 eyes of 276 patients. Intraocular pressures were measured before intravitreal injection (preIOP), immediately after intravitreal injection (postIOP0), and 30min after intravitreal injection (postIOP30). The amount of vitreous reflux was evaluated by measuring conjunctival bleb diameter, and patients were grouped as; group 1: no vitreous reflux, group 2: less vitreous reflux, and group 3: more vitreous reflux. The data were analyzed using variance analysis, chi-square test, and regression analysis. PostIOP0 values were highest in group 1, followed by group 2 and group 3 (all p values<0.001). PostIOP30 values were similar in group 1 and group 2 (p=0.261), but were lower in group 3 than other two groups (p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively). Vitreous reflux was identified as the only factor affecting postinjection intraocular pressure changes (p<0.001), and a negative correlation was found between the total number of intravitreal injection and vitreous reflux (p=0.032). The major factor affecting short-term postinjection intraocular pressure elevation was vitreous reflux, and intraocular pressure levels increased as the amount of vitreous reflux decreased. Vitreous reflux and its amount decreased as the total number of intravitreal injection increased. "
Monocanalicular Stents in Eyelid Lacerations A Report by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.,"Antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated vasculitides encompass a diverse spectrum of autoimmune diseases characterized by necrotizing small vessel vasculitis.

We report the rare case of a 55-year-old woman with a cilioretinal artery occlusion as the presenting feature of perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-associated microscopic polyangiitis. Although rare, antineutrophil cytoplasm antibody-related vasculitis should be considered in any retinal vascular occlusion, particularly in the setting of patients with new vague headaches and a paucity of vasculopathic risk factors.

Gene expression profile of extraocular muscles following resection strabismus surgery.,"To assess the prevalence and associations of small hard drusen in a child cohort. Cross-sectional study of 11- to 12-year-old Danish children from the population-based Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 Eye Study. Fovea-centered, 45 color images of both eyes were graded for macular drusen (within one optic-disc-rim-to-fovea distance of the foveal center) and for extramacular drusen. Analyses tested for associations between drusen and anthropometric measures including choroidal thickness. Gradable fundus images from both eyes were available for 1333 children (640 boys, 693 girls) with a mean (SD) age of 11.7 (0.40) years. One or more small hard macular drusen (diameter <63 m) were present in 82 (6.2%) right eyes and 82 (6.2%) left eyes and in 147 (11.0%) subjects. Four children (0.30%) had 20 or more small hard macular drusen in one or both eyes. Extramacular small hard drusen were present in 10.7% of children, and 19% of children had such drusen anywhere. The odds for having one or more small hard macular drusen increased with subfoveal choroidal thickness with an odds ratio of 1.15 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.28; P = 0.013) per 50-m thicker choroid, adjusted for age and sex. The association with choroidal thickness was also present for extramacular drusen. Having one or more small hard macular drusen was common in 11- to 12-year old children and it was associated with a thicker subfoveal choroid. Few children had many small hard drusen. There is no apparent clinical impact of small hard drusen in childhood. "
Seeing is not believing.,"The purpose of this study was to test the extent of light damage in different models of night blindness and apply these paradigms in testing the therapeutic efficacy of combination therapy by drugs acting on the Gi, Gs, and Gq protein-coupled receptors. Acute bright light exposure was used to test susceptibility to light damage in mice lacking the following crucial phototransduction proteins: rod transducin (GNAT1), cone transducin (GNAT2), visual arrestin 1 (ARR1), and rhodopsin kinase 1 (GRK1). Mice were intraperitoneally injected with either vehicle or drug combination consisting of metoprolol (1-receptor antagonist), bromocriptine (dopamine family-2 receptor agonist) and tamsulosin (1-receptor antagonist) before bright light exposure. Light damage was primarily assessed with optical coherence tomography and inspection of cone population in retinal whole mounts. Retinal inflammation was assessed in a subset of experiments using autofluorescence imaging by scanning laser ophthalmoscopy and by postmortem inspection of microglia and astrocyte activity. The Gnat1-/- mice showed slightly increased susceptibility to rod light damage, whereas the Gnat2-/- mice were very resistant. The Arr1-/- and Grk1-/- mice were sensitive for both rod and cone light damage and showed robust retinal inflammation 7 days after bright light exposure. Pretreatment with metoprolol + bromocriptine + tamsulosin rescued the retina in all genetic backgrounds, starting at doses of 0.2 mg/kg metoprolol, 0.02 mg/kg bromocriptine, and 0.01 mg/kg tamsulosin in the Gnat1-/- mice. The therapeutic drug doses increased in parallel with light-damage severity. Our results suggest that congenital stationary night blindness and Oguchi disease patients can be at an elevated risk of the toxic effects of bright light. Furthermore, systems pharmacology drug regimens that stimulate Gi signaling and attenuate Gs and Gq signaling present a promising disease-modifying therapy for photoreceptor degenerative diseases. "
"Latent Profiles of Cognitive Control, Episodic Memory, and Visual Perception Across Psychiatric Disorders Reveal a Dimensional Structure.","Hyaluronan (HA) is a potential regulator of TGF1-induced differentiation in perimysial orbital fibroblasts (pOFs). Our study aimed to explore the effects of PH20 (a hyaluronidase) and HA on TGF1-induced differentiation in pOFs cultured from thyroid-associated ophthalmopathy (TAO) and control subjects. TAO and control pOFs (passages 3-6) were incubated with TGF1  PH20 or TGF1  HA for 72 hours and processed for various analyses, including HA electrophoresis; SMA immunofluorescence; and quantification of SMA (encoded by ACTA2), CD44 (a cell surface HA receptor), and SMAD2/3 (signaling molecule in the TGF1 pathway). TGF1 induced myogenic differentiation (marked by SMA upregulation) of pOFs. After TGF1 treatment, more HA accumulated in the TAO group than in the control group. PH20 mainly digested medium to small HA and increased the percentage of high molecular weight HA (HMW-HA) in total HA. Both PH20 and HMW-HA inhibited TGF1-induced differentiation in the TAO group, but neither showed significant effects in the control group. CD44 level negatively correlated with ACTA2 level in the TAO group, but no correlation was detected in the control group. Both PH20 and HMW-HA upregulated CD44 expression and inhibited SMAD2/3 expression in the TAO group, and the inhibitory effects were partially reversed by CD44 blockage. CD44 level in the control group was not affected by PH20 or HMW-HA treatment, and CD44 blockage showed no significant effects on control pOF differentiation. PH20 inhibits TGF1-induced differentiation of TAO pOFs via HA-CD44-SMAD2/3 signaling, and the HA-CD44 signaling plays a divergent role in TAO and control pOFs. "
Impact of early detection of acute invasive fungal rhinosinusitis in immunocompromised patients.,"To compare immunocytochemical and ultrastructural features of premacular tissue surgically removed from eyes with tangential traction vitreo-maculopathies. By spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT), premacular tissue was differentiated into premacular proliferation and premacular membrane (PMM). Specimens were harvested during vitrectomy from 10 eyes with macular pucker, lamellar macular hole (LMH) and full-thickness macular hole, and prepared for immunocytochemistry and transmission electron microscopy. All specimens showed positive autofluorescence consistent with the yellow colour of peeled tissue. Glial cells were predominantly positive in premacular proliferation. Hyalocytes were the main cell type in PMM. Electron microscopy revealed densely packed premacular glial cells neighbouring hyalocytes and vitreous collagen strands. Myofibroblasts with features indicative of contractile properties were found in PMM, exclusively. Cell composition of premacular proliferation was free of contractile elements. All three types of vitreo-maculopathy have similar cell constituents in their premacular tissue. Cell population of premacular proliferation is not unique for LMHs. Corresponding to SD-OCT, electron microscopy demonstrates hyalocytes and vitreous collagen in PMMs both directly adjacent to the cellular complex of premacular proliferation. Study results point to the vitreous as one important pathogenic player potentially driving the degenerative cellular process at the vitreoretinal interface in tangential traction vitreo-maculopathies.

Cystoid macular oedema following cataract surgery: A review.,"Glycine is a proteinogenic amino acid that serves as a precursor for several proteins. The anti-cataract effects of lysine and other amino acid mixtures in animal models have been reported. Normal rats were administered saline and formed the normal control group (group I). Diabetic rats were administered streptozotocin and were the diabetic control group (group II). Rats were administered glycine (250mg and 500mg/kg of body weight) formed groups III and IV, respectively. Diabetic rats were administered sorbinil and were served as positive control (group V). The body weight changes, serum glucose, plasma insulin, total protein, glutathione (GSH) content, and mRNA and protein levels of aldose reductase were determined. Glycine treatment increased body weight gain, reduced blood glucose, and increased plasma insulin levels compared to diabetic control rats, and also increased GSH content and decreased mRNA and protein levels of aldose reductase compared to their respective controls. In summary, glycine supplementation effectively inhibited aldose reductase enzyme activity in experimental diabetic rats. "
A human amniotic membrane plug to repair retinal detachment associated with large macular tear.,"Pilot study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of oral guaifenesin in reducing the signs and symptoms of filamentary keratitis. Prospective, uncontrolled open-label pilot study. Twelve patients with non-Sjgren dry eye disease (DED) and secondary filamentary keratitis received treatment with oral guaifenesin 600mg twice a day (total dose of 1.2g/day) for 4 weeks. Adverse events, change in the number of corneal filaments, corneal fluorescein staining (CFS; NEI grading system), and symptoms (Ocular Surface Disease Index) were assessed. Before starting oral guaifenesin, all patients were on topical medical therapy for their condition. At baseline, the mean number of filaments was 5.82.9, CFS score 7.33.2, and OSDI score 55.625. After 4 weeks of treatment, the number of filaments was 2.12.2 (p=0.04 vs. baseline), CFS score 6.53.1 (p=0.5), and OSDI score 46.130.9 (p=0.2). One patient discontinued the medication due to gastrointestinal side effects. Oral guaifenesin was safe and generally well tolerated, and demonstrated modest efficacy in reducing the severity of filamentary keratitis. These results should be considered preliminary; however, placebo-controlled investigations would be justified to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of oral guaifenesin as a mucolytic in treatment of filamentary keratitis.

In vivo confocal microscopy of the inflamed anterior segment: a review of clinical and research applications.,"To evaluate the safety and efficacy of the Port Delivery System with ranibizumab (PDS) for neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD) treatment. Phase 2, multicenter, randomized, active treatment-controlled clinical trial. Patients diagnosed with nAMD within 9 months who had received  2 prior anti-vascular endothelial growth factor intravitreal injections and were responsive to treatment. Patients were randomized 3:3:3:2 to receive the PDS filled with ranibizumab 10 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL formulations or monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections. Time to first implant refill assessed when the last enrolled patient completed the month 9 visit (primary efficacy endpoint); improvement in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and central foveal thickness (CFT); and safety. The primary analysis population was 220 patients, with 58, 62, 59, and 41 patients in the PDS 10 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL arms and the monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg arm, respectively. Median time to first implant refill was 8.7, 13.0, and 15.0 months in the PDS 10 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL arms, respectively. At month 9, the adjusted mean BCVA change from baseline was 3.2, 0.5, +5.0, and +3.9 Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study letters in the PDS 10 mg/mL, 40 mg/mL, and 100 mg/mL arms and the monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg arms, respectively. At month 9, the adjusted mean CFT change from baseline was similar in the PDS 100 mg/mL and the monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg arms. The optimized PDS implant insertion and refill procedures were generally well tolerated. After surgical procedure optimization, postoperative vitreous hemorrhage rate was 4.5% (7/157; 1 event classified as serious). There was no evidence of implant clogging. In the phase 2 Ladder trial, the PDS was generally well tolerated and demonstrated a dose response across multiple endpoints in patients with nAMD. The PDS 100 mg/mL arm had visual and anatomic outcomes comparable with monthly intravitreal ranibizumab 0.5 mg injections, but with a reduced total number of ranibizumab treatments. The PDS has the potential to reduce treatment burden in nAMD while maintaining vision. "
"Heart rate, mortality, and the relation with clinical and subclinical cardiovascular diseases: results from the Gutenberg Health Study.","To evaluate changes in retinal perfusion status with intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) and laser treatment in the phase 3 VISTA study of patients with diabetic macular edema (DME). Post-hoc analysis of a double-masked, randomized, active-controlled, phase 3 trial. Patients with center-involved DME in the study eye. VISTA randomized 466 patients to laser, intravitreal aflibercept injection (IAI) 2 mg q4 weeks (2q4), or IAI 2 mg q8 weeks following five monthly doses (2q8). One eye per patient was enrolled in the study. Retinal perfusion status was evaluated by fluorescein angiography based on the presence or absence of retinal non-perfusion (RNP) in quadrants intersecting at the optic nerve head by a masked independent reading center at weeks 24, 52, 72, and 100. Visual and anatomic outcomes were evaluated at all visits. In patients who received rescue treatment, data were censored from the time rescue treatment was given. Change in perfusion status from baseline through week 100. At week 100, the proportion of eyes with improvement in retinal perfusion (defined as a reduction from baseline in the total number of quadrants in which RNP is present) in the laser control, 2q4, and 2q8 groups was 14.6%, 44.7%, and 40.0%, respectively. The proportion of eyes that experienced worsening in retinal perfusion (defined as an increase from baseline in the total number of quadrants in which RNP is present) at week 100 in the laser control, 2q4, and 2q8 groups was 25.0%, 9.0%, and 8.6%, respectively. Post-hoc analysis of the phase 3 VISTA study in patients with DME provides additional evidence that regular IAI dosing can not only slow worsening of retinal perfusion associated with diabetic retinopathy but also may be able to improve retinal perfusion in some cases by decreasing zones of RNP.

Opposite effects of dopamine and serotonin on resting-state networks: review and implications for psychiatric disorders.,"Amblyopia requires a timely diagnosis and treatment to attain maximum vision recovery. Specialty literature is lacking onhow early amblyopia is referred. We aimed to understand if there are mean age differences at first referral for ophthalmologic tertiarycenter consultation among non-amblyopic and different types of amblyopia, in a context of lack of population screening. In this retrospective model, the sample corresponded to all children born in Braga Hospital during 1997 - 2012(3 - 18 years-old), with an ophthalmologic consultation in 2014. Data was collected from the clinical records and children were dividedin a non-amblyopic versus amblyopic group. The amblyopic group was subdivided in strabismic versus refractive (anisometropic/bilateral). The sample had a total of 1665 participants, 1369 (82.2%) without amblyopia and 296 (17.8%) with amblyopia. Amongamblyopia: 67.9% (n = 201) refractive, 32.1% (n = 95) strabismic. Within refractive amblyopia: 63.7% (n = 128) anisometropic and36.3% (n = 73) bilateral. The mean age at first consultation was 6.24  3.90 years-old: 6.39  3.98 for non-amblyopic and 5.76  3.58for amblyopic. Among amblyopia subgroups, there were significant differences in mean age at first consultation (F3,1250 = 8.45; p < 0.001;2 = 0.020). Strabismic and bilateral refractive amblyopia were referred earlier, when compared to non-amblyopia or anisometropicamblyopia (p < 0.05). Anisometropic amblyopia had the highest first consultation mean age: 6.92  3.57 years-old. Without specific pre-school screening, children with amblyopia were referred to their first ophthalmologic evaluationsignificantly later than desired, especially anisometropic amblyopia, with a postschool mean age for first consultation. Recognizing high-risk children is essential for earlier referral and helps minimize future visual handicap. "
The practice patterns in the management of sebaceous carcinoma of the eyelid in the Asia Pacific region.,"JIA is the most common rheumatic disease of childhood and JIA-U is its most frequent and most devastating extraarticular manifestation. This form of uveitis is usually asymptomatic, chronic anterior uveitis, often accompained with complications. JIA-U is the main cause of vision loss and even blidness in childhood. Thus, screening for JIA-U in all JIA patients and early treatment is of prime importance. Over the last 15-20 years, ever since IMT has been used, studies generally show trends toward decrease of JIA-U onset, complications frequency, improvement of prognosis and remission achievement. Despite evident improvements, over 20% JIA-U patients still develop complications in long-term follow-up. Moreover, about 50% JIA-U patients continue to have active uveitis in adulthood. Therefore, JIA-U is still associated with high risk of late sequelae and visual acuity loss, functionally and structurally eye damage and quality of life impairment. "
Long-term outcomes of patients with myopic traction maculopathy after phacoemulsification for incident cataract.,"To investigate the influence of posterior subcapsular cataract (PSC) on structural optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography vessel density (VD) measurements. One eye each of 10 consecutive participants with PSC were imaged using the Angiovue/RTvue-XR OCT via undilated pupil, and 30 minutes later via dilated pupil. Peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT), peripapillary capillaries and all-vessels VD, ganglion cell complex thickness (GCC), parafoveal VD, and the image quality scores were compared, respectively. PSC grade (meanSD) was 4.00.9, and best-corrected visual acuity was 0.80.2. Image quality was high for all eyes and images (baseline median signal strength indices for RNFLT and GCC: 66 and 67.5; image quality scores for peripapillary and parafoveal VD: 7.5 and 6.0) and did not change statistically and clinically significantly for pupil dilation (P0.0872). The mean RNFLT and GCC values increased by 1.0 and 1.1m, respectively (P0.1382; ~1% of the normal values). In contrast, the mean peripapillary all-vessels VD value increased by 1.2% (P=0.0349) and the mean peripapillary capillaries VD value by 1.1% (P=0.0599; ~2 to 2.5% of the normal values, for both parameters). No change in parafoveal VD was seen (0.2%, P=0.8209). Our results suggest that PSC-related peripapillary VD reduction may falsely suggest glaucoma progression, even when RNFLT is not influenced by PSC. Glaucoma eyes with developing PSC need pupil dilation for peripapillary VD measurements to reduce the PSC-related VD reduction. "
Generating retinal flow maps from structural optical coherence tomography with artificial intelligence.,"Intraocular pressure (IOP) measurements, when used during telemedicine eye screening alongside nonmydriatic fundus photography, were shown to improve the likelihood of accurate glaucoma and glaucoma-related diagnoses at the follow-up eye examination. To determine if IOP measurements, used as an adjunct to nonmydriatic fundus photography, are useful in glaucoma telemedicine screening. A total of 902 high-risk individuals were screened for glaucoma at 7 primary care practices and 4 Federally Qualified Health Centers using telemedicine. Screening at visit 1 included fundus photography, assessing family history of glaucoma, and IOP measurements using a hand-held rebound tonometer. Participants with suspicious nerve findings for glaucoma, IOP>21mmHg or other ocular pathologies were invited for a follow-up appointment with an ophthalmologist (visit 2). Of the 902 individuals screened at visit 1, 19.6% (n=177/902) had elevated IOP (>21mmHg). Fifteen participants were found to have an IOP>30mmHg at visit 1, including 2 with an IOP of >40mmHg. Among all who attended visit 2 (n=347), 10.9% had glaucoma and 7.2% had ocular hypertension. For participants having both suspicious nerve findings and IOP>21mmHg compared with those with neither, the odds ratio (OR) of being diagnosed with glaucoma was 4.48 (95% CI, 1.50-13.93; P=0.007), whereas for participants with suspicious discs and IOP21mmHg the OR was 2.04 (95% CI, 0.83-5.53; P=0.15). In this telemedicine vision screening setting, having a higher IOP at the screening visit increased the likelihood of receiving a final diagnosis of glaucoma. Therefore, this study supports incorporating IOP measurements, using a portable tonometer, into vision screening programs in high-risk populations. "
Integrated HIV prevention and care for key populations.,"Patients with vision loss who are hospitalized for common illnesses are often not identified as requiring special attention. This perception, however, may affect the outcomes, resource use, and costs for these individuals. To assess whether the mean hospitalization lengths of stay, readmission rates, and costs of hospitalization differed between individuals with vision loss and those without when they are hospitalized for similar medical conditions. This analysis of health care claims data used 2 sources: Medicare database and Clinformatics DataMart. Individuals with vision loss were matched 1:1 to those with no vision loss (NVL), on the basis of age, years from initial hospitalization, sex, race/ethnicity, urbanicity of residence, and overall health. Both groups had the same health insurance (Medicare or a commercial health plan), and all had been hospitalized for common illnesses. Vision loss was categorized as either partial vision loss (PVL) or severe vision loss (SVL). Data were analyzed from April 2015 through April 2018. The outcomes were lengths of stay, readmission rates, and health care costs during hospitalization and 90 days after discharge. Multivariable logistic and linear regression models were built to identify factors associated with these outcomes among the NVL, PVL, and SVL groups. Among Medicare beneficiaries, 6165 individuals with NVL (with a mean [SD] age of 82.0 [8.3] years, and 3833 [62.2%] of whom were female) were matched to 6165 with vision loss. Of those with vision loss, 3401 (55.2%) had PVL and 2764 (44.8%) had SVL. In the Clinformatics DataMart database, 5929 individuals with NVL (with a mean [SD] age of 73.7 [15.1] years, and 3587 [60.5%] of whom were female) were matched to 5929 individuals with vision loss. Of the commercially insured enrollees with vision loss, 3515 (59.3%) had PVL and 2414 (40.7%) had SVL. Medicare enrollees with SVL, compared with those with NVL, had longer mean lengths of stay (6.48 vs 5.26 days), higher readmission rates (23.1% vs 18.7%), and higher hospitalization and 90-day postdischarge costs ($64711 vs $61060). Compared with those with NVL, Medicare beneficiaries with SVL had 4% longer length of stay (estimated ratio,1.04; 95% CI, 1.01-1.07; P=.02), 22% higher odds of readmission (odds ratio,1.22; 95% CI, 1.06-1.41; P=.007), and 12% higher costs (estimated cost ratio,1.12; 95% CI, 1.06-1.18; P<.001). Similar findings were obtained for those with commercial health insurance. When these findings were extrapolated to hospitalizations of patients with vision loss nationwide, an estimated amount of more than $500 million in additional costs annually were spent caring for these patients. These findings suggest that opportunities for improving outcomes and reducing costs exist in addressing patients' vision loss and concomitant functional difficulties during hospitalization and thereafter.

"Spastic dystonia or ""Inability to voluntary silence EMG activity""? Time for clarifying the nomenclature.","Clinical trial registries are intended to increase clinical research transparency by nonselectively identifying and documenting clinical trial designs and outcomes. Inconsistencies in reported data undermine the utility of such registries and have previously been noted in general medical literature. To assess whether inconsistencies in reported data exist between ophthalmic literature and clinical trial registries. In this retrospective, cross-sectional study, interventional clinical trials published from January 1, 2014, to December 31, 2014, in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, JAMA Ophthalmology, and Ophthalmology were reviewed. Observational, retrospective, uncontrolled, and post hoc reports were excluded, yielding a sample size of 106 articles. Data collection was performed from January through September 2016. Data review and adjudication continued through January 2017. If possible, articles were matched to registry entries listed in the ClinicalTrials.gov database or in 1 of 16 international registries indexed by the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform version 3.2 search engine. Each article-registry pair was assessed for inconsistencies in design, results, and funding (each of which was further divided into subcategories) by 2 reviewers and adjudicated by a third. Of 106 trials that met the study criteria, matching registry entries were found for 68 (64.2%), whereas no matching registry entries were found for 38 (35.8%). Inconsistencies were identified in study design, study results, and funding sources, including specific interventions in 8 (11.8%), primary outcome measure (POM) designs in 32 (47.1%), and POM results in 48 (70.6%). In addition, numerous data pieces were unreported, including analysis methods in 52 (76.5%) and POM results in 38 (55.9%). Clinical trial registries were underused in this sample of ophthalmology clinical trials. For studies with registry data, inconsistency rates between published and registered data were similar to those previously reported for general medical literature. In most cases, inconsistencies involved missing data, but explicit discrepancies in methods and/or data were also found. Transparency and credibility of published trials may be improved by closer attention to their registration and reporting. "
Neuroophthalmologic Aspects of the Vasculitides.,"Hydroxychloroquine (HCQ), an analog of chloroquine, is widely used in various rheumatologic and dermatologic disorders. However, it may cause severe retinopathy with long-term use. The guidelines proposed by the American Academy of Ophthalmology suggested a baseline fundus examination and an annual screening after 5 years by using automated visual fields (VF) plus spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Both multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) can also be used to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to examine if the current HCQ screening practice in Taiwan was sufficient according to the guidelines to prevent severe macular complications.This study could remind every doctor to explain visual side effects thoroughly to every patient using HCQ, and refer patients for the ophthalmologic survey to eliminate potential visual impairment caused by this medicine.This nationwide population-based cohort study included all patients who started taking HCQ (n=5826) from January 1, 1997, to December 31, 2007, in the Longitudinal Health Insurance Database 2000. The ICD codes used for HCQ retinopathy were 362.10, 362.55, 362.89, and 362.9. Patients previously diagnosed these retinal disorders were excluded. Demographic data including sex, age, diagnostic tools used, and the date of the initial diagnosis of the subsequent HCQ-related retinal disorder were collected. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The patients taking HCQ <5 years were defined as group 1, and >5 years as group 2. The risk of developing retinal diseases between these 2 groups was compared with a 2-sample t-test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for discrete variables. Multiple logistic regressions were used for odds ratio calculation.The baseline examination ratio of the automated VF, SD-OCT scans, and multifocal electroretinograms (mfERGs) in the first 3 months were only 0.2% in both groups. The screening ratio of the 3 examination tools after 5 years were 1.1% in group 1 and 1.2% in group 2. 2.5% and 3.9% of patients developed a retinal disorder after HCQ use in group 1 and 2, respectively. The risk of developing retinal disorder was significantly higher in group 2 (relative risk=1.53, P=.006). The odds ratio (OR) was also significantly higher in group 2 (1.67 with 95% cumulative incidence 1.20-2.30)The examination ratio according to the guidelines was very low in Taiwan. Thus, it is very important for doctors who prescribe HCQ to schedule both baseline and annual ophthalmology screening tests and inform patients of possible severe ocular complications, even in the patient taking HCQ <5 years. It is also important for ophthalmologists to review medical history carefully to find out the causes of retinotoxicity. Medications should be stopped, if possible when toxicity is recognized or strongly suspected. "
The role of netrin-1 in the mouse cornea during Aspergillus fumigatus infection.,"DNA methylation plays a significant role in many diseases. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of vision loss for people aged 50 years and above, but the etiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown. This study aimed to identify the aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in AMD and predict the related pathways on the basis of public data.Aberrant methylation can influence the functions of key genes by altering their expression. Here, we found out DEGs by overlapping public microarray data (GSE29801 and GSE102952). Functional and enrichment analyses of selected genes were performed using the DAVID database. Subsequently, protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed by using STRING and visualized in cytoscape to determine hub genes. Finally, we collected AMD patients' blood samples to identify the methylation statuses of these hub genes by using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation.In total, 156 hypermethylation-low expression genes and 127 hypomethylation-high expression genes were predicted. The hypermethylation-low expression genes were enriched in biological processes of response to cardiac conduction, ATP binding, and cell-cell junction assembly. The top 5 hub genes of the PPI network were HSP90AA1, HSPA1L, HSPE1, HSP90B1, and NOP56. Meanwhile, the hypomethylation-high expression genes were enriched in the biological processes of response to positive regulation of the MAPK cascade, actin cytoskeleton reorganization, dentate gyrus development, and cell migration. The top 5 hub genes of this PPI network were PIK3R1, EZR, IGF2, SLC2A1, and CDKN1C. Moreover, the methylation statuses of NOP56, EZR, IGF2, SLC2A1, CDKN1C were confirmed to be altered in the blood of AMD patients.This study indicated possible aberrantly methylated DEGs and differentially expressed pathways in AMD by bioinformatics analysis, providing novel insights for unraveling the pathogenesis of AMD. Hub genes, including NOP56, EZR, IGF2, SLC2A1, CDKN1C, might serve as aberrant methylation-based candidate biomarkers for AMD in future applications. "
Extracellular ATP activates P2X7R-NF-B (p65) pathway to promote the maturation of bone marrow-derived dendritic cells of mice.,"Numerous studies have reported the efficacy of fenofibrate for patients with diabetic retinopathy (DRP). No systematic review has, however, addressed its efficacy for DRP. Thus, this systematic review will firstly evaluate the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate for patients with DRP. This study will search the following databases: PUMBED, EMBASE, CINAHI, ACMD, CENTRAL, CBM, CNKI, VIP, and WANGFANG, along with grey literature from inception to the present. We will accept randomized controlled trials on evaluating the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate for DRP. The primary outcome is the progression of DRP. The secondary outcomes are vision loss, development of diabetic macular edema, aggravation of hard exudates, quality of life, and any adverse events. Methodological quality of each included study will be assessed by using Cochrane Collaboration risk of bias tool. In addition, Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool will also be used to evaluate the overall strength of the evidence. Two independent reviewers will conduct all procedures of study selection, data extraction, and methodological assessment. Any disagreements will be consulted with a third reviewer. RevMan 5.3 software will be used to pool data and to carry out the meta-analysis if it is possible. In present study, we anticipate to find a considerable number of published studies presenting evidence on efficacy and safety of fenofibrate for DRP. The findings of this systematic review will provide latest evidence of fenofibrate for patients with DRP. The findings of this scoping review will be disseminated in print, conferences, or by peer-reviewed journals. No ethical approval is needed for this systematic review, because it is a literature-based study. PROSPERO CRD42019121869. "
Are basketball players more likely to develop Hirayama disease?,"To compare the diagnostic ability of Cirrus high-definition spectral-domain optical coherence tomography measurements of the macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) vs the circumferential retinal nerve fiber layer (cpRNFL) to detect early glaucoma with hemifield visual field (VF) defects. This prospective study included 96 patients with primary open-angle glaucoma (48 with superior hemifield defects and 48 with inferior hemifield defects) and 48 normal control subjects. All glaucomatous eyes had a mean deviation of the VF defect -6.0 dB confined to one hemifield. cpRNFL and GCIPL thicknesses were recorded. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for each parameter and compared. All GCIPL parameters and most cpRNFL parameters (except at the nasal quadrant, and 2-, 3-, and 4-o'clock sectors) were significantly lower in glaucomatous eyes vs those in normal controls. In the superior hemifield defect group, the best discriminating parameters were 7-o'clock-sector cpRNFL thickness (AUROC value, 0.963), inferior cpRNFL thickness (0.926), and inferotemporal GCIPL thickness (0.923). Performance was comparable between the best measures of GCIPL analysis (inferotemporal GCIPL thickness) and those of cpRNFL (7-o'clock-sector thickness, p = 0.28). In the inferior hemifield defect group, the best discriminating parameters were 11- and 10-o'clock-sector cpRNFL thickness (0.940 and 0.904, respectively), and average cpRNFL thickness (0.909). Performance was comparable between the best measures from each method (superotemporal GCIPL thickness vs. 11-o'clock-sector cpRNFL thickness [0.857 vs 0.940, p = 0.07]). Diagnostic abilities of GCIPL parameters and cpRNFL parameters for early glaucoma were comparable for eyes with either superior or inferior hemifield VF defects. "
Human vitreous in proliferative diabetic retinopathy: Characterization and translational implications.,"The technology of using inertial measurement units (IMUs) to detect motions in different body segments has drawn enormous attention to research and industry. In our previous research, we have applied IMUs in evaluating and treating patients with vestibular hypofunction. Furthermore, according to the research, when a person's head rotates over 60 on either side in the horizontal plane, and desires to focus vision on any targets, then the function of gaze shift comes in to operation. Herein, we aimed to use IMUs to build up a system to evaluate vestibular ocular reflex (VOR) during gaze shifting maneuver. In this study, we developed a platform, which combines the features of gaze shift and computerized dynamic visual acuity (cDVA), called the gaze shift DVA (gsDVA) platform. The gsDVA platform measures the orientations of the subject's head by IMU, and executed the evaluation according to the algorithm that was developed by us. Finally, we used the VICON system to validate the performance of gsDVA platform. The performance of the accuracy was 2.41  1.08, the maximal sensor error was within 4.25, and highly correlated between our platform and VICON (p < 0.05, R = 0.99). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of between-day and within-day was 0.984 and 0.999, respectively. Furthermore, the platform not only executed the evaluation automatically but also recorded other information besides the head orientation, such as rotation speed, rotation time, reaction time, and visual acuity. In this study, we demonstrated the utility of vestibular evaluation, and this platform can help to clarify the relationship between gaze shift and VOR. This methodology is useful and can be applied efficiently to different disease groups for interactive evaluation and rehabilitation programs. "
The relationship between occupation and dry eye.,"Cutaneous endometriosis is an uncommon dermatologic disorder predominantly seen in young women. Most commonly, it presents within a region of a previous surgical scar, often in relation to a gynecologic procedure on the abdomen or in close proximity to the umbilicus. The typical clinical presentation is that of papules or nodules with monthly cyclical pain and size variation. Histologically, the lesions are composed of endometrial stroma and glands. The pathophysiology is not well understood but is believed to be due to metastasis or seeding of endometrial cells. When this uncommon disorder occurs outside of the most typical clinical setting, it may cause some diagnostic difficulty. In this report, we present the first known case of cutaneous endometriosis on the eyelid. "
Differences in retinal nerve fiber layer thickness measured by spectral domain optical coherence tomography between primary congenital glaucoma patients and healthy children.,"To determine the integrity of colour perception, related to photic sensitivity, in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Twenty-four patients with photoparoxysmal response, 27 patients without photoparoxysmal response, and 32 healthy individuals were investigated using the Farnsworth Munsell-100 Hue test to calculate error scores for total colour, blue/yellow, and red/green. No significant differences were observed regarding blue/yellow, red/green or total error score between juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients with or without photoparoxysmal response. However, the data for all three scores were significantly higher in both patient groups compared to the healthy control group. In both patient groups, the blue/yellow error score was significantly higher than the red/green error score. We were unable to identify a relationship between photoparoxysmal response and colour vision in patients with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. We believe that the underlying reason why juvenile myoclonic epilepsy patients had significantly higher blue/yellow, red/green, and total error score compared to the healthy control group may be due to GABA dysfunction, which is considered to play a role in the pathophysiology of this disease as well as the physiology of colour vision. "
Functional MRI of the mouse olfactory system.,"To explore the regularities of clinical application of hand acupuncture therapy to the treatment of diseases of different departments by using data mining technique, so as to provide a reference for clinical practice. We searched papers, academic dissertations and case reports (published in journals from Jan 1, 1953 to December 31, 2017) from databases of China National Knowledge Internet (CNKI), VIP, and Wanfang, and also searched papers from medical books about hand acupuncture treatment of different diseases/illness by using keywords of ""hand acupuncture"" and ""hand acupoints"" followed by constructing a database after sorting, screening, recording, extracting, and statistical analysis by using a computer. Then, the data mining was conducted for summarizing the characteristics and rules of the hand acupuncture therapy in clinical application. The hand acupuncture therapy in Chinese medical journals was found to be applied to various clinical departments, with the frequency from high to low successively being 16 types of diseases (37.21%) in the surgery, 15 diseases (34.88%) in the internal medicine, 2 diseases (4.65%) in the pediatrics, 8 diseases (18.60%) in the ophthalmology-otorhinolaryngology, 1 disease (2.33%) in the genecology and 1 disease (2.33%) in the dermatology. In the treatment of diseases, the cure plus markedly effective rate of hand acupuncture was found to be highest for diseases of the pediatrics (90.65%), and was 88.45% surgery, 78.06% internal medicine, 89.96% ophthalmology-otorhinolaryngology, 60.61% gynecology, and 67.73% dermatology, respectively. When hand acupuncture used, the acupoints of the hand region on both sides, healthy side and affected side were often selected, and movement exercise was often used in combination, particularly for problems of the surgery. In the collected medical records and 6 acupuncture books, the hand acupuncture was employed for treatment of 34 and 123 kinds of diseases or problems, respectively, with the tissue injury, lumbocrural pain being most frequently seen in the records, and abdominal pain, lumbocrural, chest obstruction, etc. most frequently seen in the acupuncture books. Hand acupuncture therapy is widely used in the treatment of many clinical problems of different departments, such as tissue injury, leg pain, etc. of the surgery; abdominal pain, asthma, etc. of the internal medicine; infantile enuresis, diarrhea, etc. of the pediatrics. Acupoints of the hand on the unilateral side are frequently employed and may have a better therapeutic effect. "
Interocular transfer of visual memory - Influence of visual impairment and abnormalities of the optic chiasm.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) is a new modality in ocular imaging which provides non-invasive assessment and measurement of the vascular structures in the retina and optic nerve head. This technique provides useful information in glaucoma, such as quantitative assessment of vessel density. Vessel density measurement can be affected by various subject-related, eye-related, and disease-related factors. Overall, OCTA has good repeatability and reproducibility, and can differentiate glaucoma eyes from normal eyes. It can also help detect early glaucoma, reach a floor effect at a more advanced disease stage than optical coherence tomography (OCT), and adds information about glaucoma patients at risk of progression. Although it has higher variability than OCT, it also promises to be useful for monitoring glaucoma by detecting progression throughout the glaucoma continuum. "
Implementation of Lean and Six Sigma Principles in Ophthalmology for Improving Quality of Care and Patient Flow.,"ADP-ribosylation factor-like 2 (ARL2) protein participates in a broad range of cellular processes and acts as a mediator for mutant ARL2BP in cilium-associated retinitis pigmentosa and for mutant HRG4 in mitochondria-related photoreceptor degeneration. However, mutant ARL2 has not been linked to any human disease so far. Here we identified a de novo variant in ARL2 (c.44G>T, p.R15L) in a Chinese pedigree with MRCS (microcornea, rod-cone dystrophy, cataract, and posterior staphyloma) syndrome through whole exome sequencing and co-segregation analysis. Co-immunoprecipitation assay and immunoblotting confirmed that the mutant ARL2 protein showed a 62% lower binding affinity for HRG4 while a merely 18% lower binding affinity for ARL2BP. Immunofluorescence images of ARL2 and HRG4 co-localizing with cytochrome c in HeLa cells described their relationship with mitochondria. Further analyses of the mitochondrial respiratory chain and ATP production showed significant abnormalities under an ARL2-mutant condition. Finally, we generated transgenic mice to test the pathogenicity of this variant and observed retinal degeneration complicated with microcornea and cataract that were similar to those in our patients. In conclusion, we uncover ARL2 as a novel candidate gene for MRCS syndrome and suggest a mitochondria-related mechanism of the first ARL2 variant through site-directed mutagenesis studies.

Remission Of Non-Infectious Anterior Scleritis: Incidence And Predictive Factors.,"Myopia is a refractive error of the eye caused by a complex interplay between nature and nurture. The aim of this study was to investigate whether environmental risk factors can influence the genetic effect in children developing myopia. A total of 3422 children participating in the birth-cohort study Generation R underwent an extensive eye examination at 9years with measurements of refractive error and axial length corneal radius ratio (AL/CR). Environmental risk factors were evaluated using a questionnaire, and environmental risk scores (ERS) were calculated using backward regression analyses. Genetic risk scores (GRS) were calculated based on all currently known risk variants for myopia. Gene-environment interaction (GE) was investigated using linear and logistic regression analyses. The predictive value of GE and parental myopia was estimated using receiver operating characteristic curves. Myopia prevalence was 12%. Both GRS (P<0.01) and ERS (P<0.01) were significantly associated with myopia and AL/CR, as was GE interaction (P<0.01 for myopia; P=0.07 for AL/CR). The predictive value of parental myopia was 0.67 (95% CI 0.65-0.70), similar to the values of GRS (0.67; 95% CI 0.64-0.70; P=0.98) and ERS (0.69; 95% CI 0.66-0.72; P=0.98). Adding GE interaction significantly improved the predictive value to 0.73 (95% CI 0.70-0.75; P<0.01). This study provides evidence that nature and nurture are equally important for myopia and AL/CR; however, the combination has the strongest influence. Since myopia genes are common in the population, adjustment of lifestyleshould be a major focus in the prevention of myopia. "
Factors Predictive of Double Anterior Chamber Formation Following Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.,"The aim of this study was to examine the ophthalmological characteristics and genotypes of patients with congenital retinal pathologies, who display a bull's-eye maculopathy in the fundus, along with a negative scotopic electroretinogram. We analysed the results of five patients showing both a bull's-eye maculopathy, as well as a negative scotopic ERG evoked by a bright flash. Their median age was 39years (range 11-63years): three males and two females. All underwent a comprehensive examination with determination of distant visual acuity (ETDRS) and recording of the full-field ERG (scotopic and photopic). Fundus, OCT, and FAF images were obtained, the kinetic visual field was determined, and colour vision (D-15) was tested in most patients. Targeted gene panel sequencing was performed on peripheral blood. One patient carried a homozygous ABCA4 mutation and an additional heterozygous variant in CRX. Two of the five patients were shown to have a heterozygous mutation in the CRX gene, one of whom had an additional heterozygous ABCA4 mutation. Two patients had the common heterozygous mutation c.2413G>A;p.Arg838His in GUCY2D. In all of the patients, there was a reduction in the amplitude of the b-wave with a regular a-wave amplitude in the scotopic bright-flash ERG. The five patients with bull's-eye maculopathy along with a negative ERG had differing genotypes. Mutations were found in the CRX gene (2 patients), the ABCA4 gene (1 patient), and the GUCY2D gene (2 patients). "
Microbial Keratitis in Taiwan: A 20-Year update.,"In this study, we aimed to determine the electrophysiological efficacy, safety, and electrical stability of a chronically implanted electrode for suprachoroidal transretinal stimulation (STS) in rabbit eyes. A platinum microelectrode was implanted into the scleral pocket of rabbit eyes (n=5) and followed-up for 6months. To evaluate the electrophysiological efficacy, electrically evoked potentials (EEPs) were measured every month after implantation. To evaluate safety, fundus examinations, fluorescein angiograms, electroretinograms (ERGs), and visually evoked potentials (VEPs) were measured before and every month after the implantation. At the end of the experiment, histological examination of retinal tissue beneath the site of the electrode was performed. To evaluate electrical stability, the resistance of the circuit was measured every month after implantation. EEPs could be elicited from the STS electrodes at all testing times. The mean threshold current to evoke EEPs was 186.447.0A at 6months after implantation. There was no significant change in the threshold over the follow-up period. The resistance of the circuit was significantly increased at 1months after implantation, with no further increase at 6months. There was no statistically significant change in the relative amplitudes and implicit times of a- and b-waves of ERGs and VEPs. No intraocular infection, inflammation, or vitreoretinal proliferation was observed in any eye. Histological examination revealed no retinal damage beneath the electrode. We conclude that chronically implanted electrodes for STS appear to be effective, safe, and electrically stable. "
Focal and diffuse chronic central serous chorioretinopathy treated with half-dose photodynamic therapy or subthreshold micropulse laser.,"To establish the extent of anterior chamber angle circumference needed to maintain a physiological outflow facility (C). This could create a model to investigate focal outflow regulation. Twenty anterior segments of porcine eyes were assigned to five groups, each with a different degree of cyanoacrylate-mediated angle closure: 90 (n=4), 180 (n=4), 270 (n=4), 360 (n=4), and four unoccluded control eyes. The outflow facility was measured at baseline, 3, 12, 24, and 36h after angle closure. Outflow patterns were evaluated with canalograms and the histomorphology was compared. Baseline outflow facilities of the five groups were similar (F=0.922, p=0.477). Occlusion of 360 induced a significant decrease in facility from baseline at all time-points (p0.023 at 3, 12, 24, and 36h). However, no difference from baseline was found in any of the partially occluded (0-270) groups (F0.067, p0.296 at 3, 12, 24, and 36h). The canalograms confirmed the extent of occlusion with flow through the unblocked regions. Histology revealed no adverse effects of blockage on the TM or aqueous plexus in the unoccluded angle portions. The unoccluded TM appeared normal. Cyanoacrylate-mediated angle occlusion created a reproducible angle closure model. Ninety degrees of unoccluded anterior chamber angle circumference was sufficient to maintain physiological outflow. This model may help understand how outflow can be regulated in healthy, nonglaucomatous TM. "
The Responsibility to Recontact Research Participants after Reinterpretation of Genetic and Genomic Research Results.,"Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a major complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells transplantation, occurring in about half of transplanted patients. This condition seems to be the result of a progressive immune-mediated damage that can involve various tissues, including the eyes. The ocular surface system is the ocular structure most frequently impaired, and dry eye disease is considered the hallmark of ocular GVHD. Given the increasing prevalence and the frequent severe involvement of the ocular surface with vision-threatening complications, ocular GVHD represents a current diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. The purpose of this literature review is to describe all the clinical manifestations occurring in the setting of ocular GVHD, and to further report the outcomes of conventional and novel therapies. A literature search about ocular GVHD was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Medline databases, and ClinicalTrials.gov as well as through the reference lists of identified publications until January 2019. We have included RCTs, prospective observational studies, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, pilot studies, and review articles. Overall, 107 articles, 3 book chapters, and 6 ongoing registered clinical trials were collected and analyzed. Ocular GVHD can affect all the structures of the entire ocular surface system, including lacrimal and meibomian glands, cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids, nasolacrimal duct, and tears. Current medical treatment is mainly focused on lubrication and control of drainage, tear evaporation, and ocular surface inflammation. Surgical treatment may be necessary in severe, recalcitrant, or complicated cases. Amniotic membrane and tectonic keratoplasty can be valid options to restore the integrity of the cornea. Recently, conjunctival and limbal transplantation from the same living-related bone marrow donor has been proposed to manage both dry eye and limbal stem cell deficiency, without any risk of immunologic rejection. This review provides an up-to-date analysis on clinical findings and current and future management of ocular GVHD. A correct and prompt diagnosis along with an appropriate and aggressive treatment are fundamental for avoiding the occurrence of vision-threatening complications. "
The Effect of Molecular Weight on Passage of Proteins Through the Blood-Aqueous Barrier.,"Nucleocytoplasmic transport is dysregulated in sporadic and familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and retinal ganglion neurons (RGNs) are purportedly involved in ALS. The Ran-binding protein 2 (Ranbp2) controls rate-limiting steps of nucleocytoplasmic transport. Mice with Ranbp2 loss in Thy1<sup>+</sup>-motoneurons develop cardinal ALS-like motor traits, but the impairments in RGNs and the degree of dysfunctional consonance between RGNs and motoneurons caused by Ranbp2 loss are unknown. This will help to understand the role of nucleocytoplasmic transport in the differential vulnerability of neuronal cell types to ALS and to uncover non-motor endophenotypes with pathognomonic signs of ALS. Here, we ascertain Ranbp2's function and endophenotypes in RGNs of an ALS-like mouse model lacking Ranbp2 in motoneurons and RGNs. Thy1<sup>+</sup>-RGNs lacking Ranbp2 shared with motoneurons the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport. RGN abnormalities were comprised morphologically by soma hypertrophy and optic nerve axonopathy and physiologically by a delay of the visual pathway's evoked potentials. Whole-transcriptome analysis showed restricted transcriptional changes in optic nerves that were distinct from those found in sciatic nerves. Specifically, the level and nucleocytoplasmic partition of the anti-apoptotic and novel substrate of Ranbp2, Pttg1/securin, were dysregulated. Further, acetyl-CoA carboxylase 1, which modulates de novo synthesis of fatty acids and T-cell immunity, showed the highest up-regulation (35-fold). This effect was reflected by the activation of ramified CD11b<sup>+</sup> and CD45<sup>+</sup>-microglia, increase of F4\\80<sup>+</sup>-microglia and a shift from pseudopodial/lamellipodial to amoeboidal F4\\80<sup>+</sup>-microglia intermingled between RGNs of naive mice. Further, there was the intracellular sequestration in RGNs of metalloproteinase-28, which regulates macrophage recruitment and polarization in inflammation. Hence, Ranbp2 genetic insults in RGNs and motoneurons trigger distinct paracrine signaling likely by the dysregulation of nucleocytoplasmic transport of neuronal-type selective substrates. Immune-modulators underpinning RGN-to-microglial signaling are regulated by Ranbp2, and this neuronal-glial system manifests endophenotypes that are likely useful in the prognosis and diagnosis of motoneuron diseases, such as ALS.

Weakly supervised lesion localization for age-related macular degeneration detection using optical coherence tomography images.,"StrabisPIX is a smartphone application that allows clinicians to prescribe a series of self-obtained images of head position and eye alignment in nine positions of gaze that are uploaded onto a secure platform for clinician review. This study evaluates the clinical utility of this application. In this prospective, nonmasked, cross-sectional study, 30 strabismus patients aged 2 years were evaluated. Participants received standardized instructions, used StrabisPIX to obtain images as prompted, and completed a satisfaction survey. During the same visit, an orthoptist obtained standard clinical images with a professional camera. All 60 image sets were evaluated by three observers. StrabisPIX image quality was similar to that of clinic photographs. Clinic photographs had significantly higher acceptability for horizontal versions (81% vs. 67%), vertical versions (76% vs. 60%), and head posture (93% vs. 81%). Abnormalities were detected at a similar rate for versions, head posture, eyelid position, and pupil size. StrabisPIX had significantly higher detection of alignment abnormalities (89% vs. 77% for clinical photos). Interrater/intrarater agreements were moderate to high ( = 0.44-1.00) for all parameters except pupil abnormality, which had poor to fair agreement. Most patients reported that StrabisPIX was easy to learn and use. Overall, StrabisPIX images had similar quality and were as useful as images obtained in the clinic in detecting abnormalities. The StrabisPIX application will enhance the use of telemedicine by allowing physicians to prescribe self-obtained images documenting strabismus. "
Forecasting future Humphrey Visual Fields using deep learning.,"We describe a modification of Cutler-Beard's technique, using a contralateral tarsoconjunctival graft, in patients who underwent excision of large malignant tumors of the upper eyelid. This is an interventional retrospective review (clinical study) of ten cases, with age range from 64 to 86years (mean: 71.2years6.49) with malignant upper eyelid tumors, operated by the same surgeon (AB-G), between 2011 and 2016. The resulting defects were reconstructed using a modification of Cutler-Beard's technique. A tarsoconjunctival graft was harvested from the contralateral upper eyelid, with an extra 3mm of conjunctiva from the superior edge of tarsus and was attached to the upper eyelid defect, different from that previously described. Follow-up ranged between 24 and 60months (mean: 41.69.87). Functional, cosmetic outcomes and postoperative complications were evaluated. No upper eyelid retraction, eyelid margin entropion, or graft retraction was observed in any of the cases. All of the patients were satisfied with the aesthetic result. This technique allows us to safely inset a suitable graft on the ocular surface, with sufficient blood supply, resulting in a stable margin and good contour. "
Early Buckle Migration and Restrictive Strabismus after Successful Medical Management of Scleral Buckle Infection.,"To investigate the influence of phenylephrine and tropicamide on anterior segment biometry with ultralong scan depth optical coherence tomography (UL-OCT) during accommodation. In this study, 20 left eyes of healthy volunteers with a meanstandard deviation age of 31.055.84years and a mean refraction of -1.161.11 diopters (range 0-3.0D) were imaged using UL-OCT after instillation of artificial tears, phenylephrine, and tropicamide in three follow-up trials, respectively. At each follow-up trial, two repeated measurements were performed at states of relax and 5D accommodative stimulation. The dimensional parameters included central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (ACD), pupil diameter (PD), lens thickness (LT), and horizontal radii of the lens anterior and posterior surface curvatures (LAC and LPC). Tropicamide led to larger pupil, deeper ACD, thinner LT, and flatter crystalline lens surface (<i>P</i> < 0.05). Phenylephrine induced an increase in PD (<i>P</i> < 0.05), while no significant changes were seen in ACD, LT, LAC, and LPC (<i>P</i> > 0.05). CCT did not change after both phenylephrine and tropicamide instillation in this study (<i>P</i> > 0.05). Tropicamide induced the loss of accommodation and phenylephrine achieved pupil dilation without affecting the accommodation. PD, ACD decreased, LT increased significantly and the anterior and posterior surface of the lens in a 6.294mm of diameter optical zone became steeper during accommodation after administration of phenylephrine (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The anterior segment physiology changed after tropicamide instillation. Besides, tropicamide induced the loss of accommodation and phenylephrine preserved the accommodation with a larger pupil. And, the anterior and posterior surface of lens in a 6.294mm of diameter optical zone became steeper during the accommodation. "
Adherence to oxygen saturation targets increased in preterm infants when a higher target range and tighter alarm limits were introduced.,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a modern, non-invasive therapeutic method used for the destruction of various cells and tissues. It requires the simultaneous presence of three components: a photosensitizer (PS), a light source and oxygen. Precancerous skin lesions are conditions associated with a high likelihood of malignant transformation to squamous cell carcinoma. Data available so far indicate that PDT is a promising treatment method which can be successfully employed in several medical fields including dermatology, urology, ophthalmology, pneumology, cardiology, dentistry and immunology. Numerous authors therefore have studied this technique in order to improve its efficacy. As a result, significant advancement has been achieved with regard to PSs and drug delivery systems. Substantial progress was also obtained with respect to PDT for the treatment of precancerous skin lesions, several authors focusing their efforts on the study of daylight-PDT and on identifying methods of decreasing technique-related pain. This review reports on the most recent findings in PDT, with emphasis on cutaneous precancerous lesions. "
Assessment of Automated Identification of Phases in Videos of Cataract Surgery Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques.,"Surgical face masks are worn by theatre staff to protect the surgical site from airborne contamination and the wearer from bodily fluid splash. This observational/audit aimed to assess whether theatre staff wear masks in accordance with manufacturers'/Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines of use. A total of 1034 surgically scrubbed staff were assessed on their technique of applying surgical face masks, compared to the CDC guidelines as manufacturers' guidelines were not available as per Health and Safety Executive guidelines. Only 18% of surgically scrubbed staff fully complied with the CDC guidelines on the application of a face mask. Compliance was worst in urology, ophthalmology and vascular surgeons, whereas orthopaedic and plastic surgeons were the most compliant. Compliance with CDC face mask guidelines may have an impact on surgical site infections (SSI) and protection of staff from body fluid splash, but most staff do not comply with these guidelines. Most operating theatre staff do not apply a face mask using correct technique, outlined in CDC guidance, which may increase SSI rates. Staff are not aware of existing guidelines for donning a mask.

Isolated Abducens Nerve Palsy as Manifestation of Diffuse Intracranial Dolichoectasia.,"Orbital sparganosis represents an extremely rare condition with only a few cases being reported in literature. Here we describe cases of orbital sparganosis, including their etiology, clinical findings, and surgical outcomes. A retrospective review was performed on patients with orbital sparganosis, who were treated at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, of Sun Yat-sen University, China between 2000 and 2012. Five patients (three males and two females, one right orbit and four left orbits) were identified. Their mean age was 14.8 years (range=6-33 years). Four cases were contracted from eating raw snakes and fishes, or placing poultices of frog on open wounds. All cases showed a swelling and/or redness of the eyelid and conjunctiva, and a migrating inflammation was present in one of the cases. High levels of blood eosinophils were observed in three of these cases. Of the two patients examined using computed tomography, one showed a diffuse soft tissue infiltration and a punctate calcification, while one of the three patients examined using magnetic resonance imaging displayed an annular ""tunnel sign"" within the lesion. All patients underwent an anterior orbitotomy and the entire worm was removed with no surgical complications. Orbital sparganosis should be highly suspected in patients with a history of eating raw snakes and frogs, a migrating orbital inflammation and the presence of eosinophilia. Orbital imaging examinations play an important role in the diagnosis of orbital sparganosis. Surgical removal of the entire worm is required. "
Management of Peripapillary Choroidal Neovascular Membrane in Patients With Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension.,"Direct closure (DC) of eyelid defects has been retrospectively shown to give excellent outcomes. We present prospective outcome data as further evidence to promote its wider use. A consecutive, unselected, series of patients undergoing eyelid tumour resection was studied prospectively. DC was attempted at the time of biopsy in all of them. If DC proved impossible, delayed reconstruction using other techniques was later performed. Defect size, pre- and post-operative palpebral aperture (PA) measurements and the final visit patients' and surgeons' satisfaction scores for function and appearance were recorded. Seventy-three eyelids of 70 patients were studied. Mean resected specimen width was 16.4mm (4-26mm) in the DC group, versus 23.9mm (11-42mm) for other, non-DC reconstructions. Primary DC was achieved in 74% of this cohort. Mean final post-operative PA measurements in the DC group were 0.7mm vertically (p=0.003) and 0.8mm horizontally (p=0.009) less than preoperatively, but there was no statistical difference (p=0.1) in the final horizontal measurements between the operated and un-operated sides in the DC group. DC satisfaction scores were excellent for both eyelid function and appearance. DC of eyelid defects, irrespective of per-operative PA distortion, gives excellent late post-operative outcomes. We recommend that DC, aligning the closure tension parallel to the lid margin, is attempted whenever wound margin approximation is possible in preference to alternative reconstruction techniques, regardless of any temporary PA distortion and globe displacement that this may cause. Eyelid function and appearance recover to near normal within 2 months. "
Important Role of Epiretinal Membrane in Tractional Vitreomaculopathies.,"To compare the long-term surgical outcomes between bilateral lateral rectus recession (BLR) and unilateral lateral rectus recession-medial rectus plication (RP) in intermittent exotropia. Children who underwent BLR or RP for basic type intermittent exotropia between 2015 and 2016 with a minimum follow-up period of 2 years were retrospectively reviewed. Surgical outcomes were classified based on postoperative angle of deviation as follows: success (esodeviation5 prism diopters [PD] to exodeviation 10 PD), and failure (overcorrection [esodeviation >5 PD] and undercorrection or recurrence [exodeviation >10 PD]). Of 144 patients, 90 underwent BLR and 54 underwent RP. The angle of exodeviation of the RP group steadily increased over time after the surgery. The BLR group showed an earlier exodrift and a more stable course compared to the RP group. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed a better survival in the BLR group, with final success rates of 48.9% in the BLR group and 25.9% in the RP group after a mean follow-up of 2.2 years. Patients with a successful outcome had greater esodeviation at 1 week postoperatively (at distance 7.6 PD in the BLR group, 11.4 in the RP group). Surgical outcomes were better in the BLR group than in the RP group. The RP group showed higher rates of recurrence of exodeviation, while the BLR group presented a more stable course. Establishing more esodeviation at postoperative week 1 in the RP group compared to the BLR group would be required to achieve successful results. "
PHOTODYNAMIC THERAPY FOR EXTRAFOVEOLAR CHOROIDAL OSTEOMA.,"The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of systemic antiparasitic medications alone or in combination with surgical aspiration in management of presumed trematode-induced anterior uveitis in children. Prospective case series. Children who presented with anterior chamber (AC) granuloma were included in the study. All patients received antiparasitic treatment and after 2 weeks; patients were divided based on their clinical improvement in terms of the baseline granuloma area into two groups: group A (<2.5mm<sup>2</sup>) who continued on antiparasitic medications only (n=15) and group B (2.5mm<sup>2</sup>) who underwent surgical aspiration (n=15). Basic demographics data, visual acuity (VA), corneal thickness, granuloma area and AC activity (cells and flare) were recorded and analysed. Systemic work-up including stool and urine analysis, full blood count, chest X-ray and schistosomiasis titre were performed. Thirty eyes of 30 patients were included in the study with a mean age of 13.42.42 years. All patients were male. Patients were examined and followed at Mansoura Ophthalmic Center, Mansoura University. Both groups showed statistically significant improvement in VA, AC activity, corneal thickness and granuloma area (p-value<0.001), which was achieved with medical treatment only in group A. However, in group B granuloma required aspiration and did not recur after that. Presumed trematode-induced AC granuloma is common among children living in the rural areas of Egypt. Antiparasitic medication alone was found to be effective for small-sized granulomas. Surgical aspiration is an effective adjuvant procedure to treat large-sized ones. "
MORPHOLOGIC FEATURES OF THE RETINAL PIGMENT EPITHELIUM AND ASSOCIATED CHORIORETINAL CHARACTERISTICS IN EYES WITH EARLY AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION AND SUBRETINAL DRUSENOID DEPOSITS.,"To analyze features of the choriocapillaris in eyes with earlier stages of pachychoroid spectrum, this study included 46 eyes with PPE, 32 age-matched eyes with pachychoroid without epitheliopathy, and 30 normal controls. Macular 33 mm<sup>2</sup> angiographic images were obtained with swept-source optical coherence tomography. Vascular density and signal void area in the choriocapillaris were analyzed. Topographical correlation of signal voids with the dilated choroidal large vessel (pachyvessel) was assessed. Choriocapillaris vascular density was significantly lower in eyes with PPE compared with controls (p=0.003). The number, the total area and the average size of signal voids was the highest in the PPE group followed by the pachychoroid without epitheliopathy and then controls (all p0.001). 89.0% signal void area colocalized with pachyvessels. The average size of the signal void was higher if it was colocalized with pachyvessel (p<0.001). In conclusion, the area of flow impairment in the choriocapillaris was increased in eyes with pachychoroid and even greater when epitheliopathy was present. Pachyvessel was associated with choriocapillaris flow impairment by location and size. "
Kahook Dual Blade Excisional Goniotomy and Goniosynechialysis Combined with Phacoemulsification for Angle Closure Glaucoma: 6-Month Results.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer type and the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death. This cancer appears with higher incidence in men and during obesity; however, the specific mechanisms underlying this correlation are unknown. Adipose tissue, a key organ in metabolic syndrome, shows evident gender disparities in the production of adipokines. Levels of the important adipokine adiponectin decrease in men during puberty, as well as in the obese state. Here, we show that this decrease in adiponectin levels is responsible for the increased liver cancer risk in males. We found that testosterone activates the protein JNK in mouse and human adipocytes. JNK-mediated inhibition of adiponectin secretion increases liver cancer cell proliferation, since adiponectin protects against liver cancer development through the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) and p38. This study provides insight into adipose tissue to liver crosstalk and its gender relation during cancer development, having the potential to guide strategies for new cancer therapeutics. "
pH of Mitomycin-C Formulations for Filtration Surgery.,"Bimatoprost-timolol (bimatoprost 0.03%-timolol 0.5% fixed-dose combination [FDC]) and tafluprost-timolol (tafluprost 0.0015%-timolol 0.5% FDC) eye drops are currently the only topical intraocular pressure (IOP)-reducing therapies available as preservative-free (PF) prostaglandin and timolol FDC. The aim of this study was to investigate changes to ocular signs and symptoms when patients with ocular hypertension (OH) or open-angle glaucoma (OAG) switched from PF or benzalkonium chloride (BAK)-preserved bimatoprost-timolol to PF tafluprost-timolol eye drops. This was a 12-week, open-label, phase IV study. Sixteen centres in Finland, Germany, Italy and the UK. Patients with OH or OAG (IOP on medication 21mm Hg), treated with PF or BAK-preserved bimatoprost-timolol for 4 weeks before screening, and presenting with conjunctival hyperaemia and 1ocular symptom. Patients were switched to PF tafluprost-timolol once daily in the treated eye(s). The primary endpoints were change from screening to week 12 in conjunctival hyperaemia and worst ocular symptom. The secondary outcome measures were changes from screening in ocular signs (other than conjunctival hyperaemia) and symptoms at week 12. Of 123 enrolled patients, 121 were included in the intention-to-treat dataset, of which all were Caucasian and 54.5% were female; 76 patients used BAK-preserved bimatoprost-timolol and 45 used PF drops. Conjunctival hyperaemia and severity of worst ocular symptom following switch to PF tafluprost-timolol significantly reduced from screening to week 12 in all patients (p<0.001). The percentage of patients with ocular signs and symptoms was significantly reduced at week 12 compared with screening (p<0.001). IOP was not affected by the change of treatment. Switching from BAK-preserved or PF bimatoprost-timolol to tafluprost-timolol reduced both signs and symptoms of ocular surface disease with no clinically relevant effect on IOP.

Differences in Optic Nerve Head Blood Flow Regulation in Normal Tension Glaucoma Patients and Healthy Controls as Assessed with Laser Speckle Flowgraphy During the Water Drinking Test.,"Glaucoma is a lifelong condition often requiring surgical intervention. To allow us to inform patients' expectations of surgery effectively, it is important to understand patients' preferences and concerns regarding outcomes from glaucoma treatments including surgery. To explore what clinical and social outcomes of glaucoma surgery are important to patients. Forty-five glaucoma patients undergoing medical glaucoma treatments or surgery were recruited for focus group interviews to determine their opinions regarding the outcomes of glaucoma treatments. Thematic analysis was performed with NVivo software. Themes identified were understanding glaucoma, understanding surgery treatments and understanding treatment outcomes. The most important outcomes of the glaucoma surgery reported by the patients were social factors. Patients felt that being able to maintain their driving licence is a strong indicator of successful glaucoma treatment/surgery. Other important outcomes were independent living, ability to care for their family and having a good-quality social life. When considering novel surgical treatments, most patients felt that certainty of successful outcome and proven longevity of the effect are the primary motivators for choosing these treatments. Patients understood that clinical measures were surrogates for maintaining visual function, but ability to maintain independent living was the most important outcome from their treatment. For newer treatments patients wished to know more about long-term outcomes when considering this option. "
Endothelin-1 Concentration in Aqueous Humor Predicts Postoperative Late Low Intraocular Pressure in Primary Open Angle Glaucoma After Trabeculectomy.,"To report the clinical course and outcomes of adjunctive dexamethasone implants in patients with atopic dermatitis (AD) and retinal detachment (RD) undergoing vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade. This retrospective, interventional case series included AD patients with RD and various degrees of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) who were scheduled to undergo vitrectomy. Following total vitrectomy and retinopexy, silicone oil tamponade was performed. Finally, an intraocular dexamethasone implant was injected intravitreally. Anatomical and functional outcomes were assessed at 12months, and extended follow-up data were also collected. Seven eyes from six patients (five male, one female) were included. The median age was 29 (range, 20-38) years. Preoperatively, six eyes were pseudophakic, two eyes had a history of previous vitreoretinal surgery, and one had uveitis. Postoperatively, best-corrected visual acuity improved in two eyes, worsened in one, and remained similar in four. Retinal attachment was maintained in all eyes at 12months. The major complication was an increase in postoperative intraocular pressure in six eyes, requiring either medical or surgical treatment. During the extended follow-up period (15-37months), retinas remained attached in all eyes and stable visual acuity was maintained in five. Injection of an intraoperative dexamethasone implant to silicone oil-filled eyes appears tolerable and may be beneficial in the surgical management of AD patients with RD and PVR. "
Surgical Outcomes of Intraconal Cavernous Venous Malformation According to Their Location in Four Right-Angled Sectors.,"To report the epidemiology and clinical features of viral anterior uveitis in patients in southern Taiwan. A retrospective, case series study. HLA-B27 negative anterior uveitis patients with increased intraocular pressure or corneal edema seen at Kaohsiung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital from January 1, 2007 to January 31, 2018 had their aqueous sent for polymerase chain reaction analysis. Their records were reviewed for demographic data, ocular findings, and laboratory results. In the aqueous samples obtained from 102 eligible eyes, 42 eyes were herpesviridae-positive, which included 9 with herpes simplex virus (8.8%), 5 with varicella-zoster virus (4.9%), 27 with cytomegalovirus (26.5%), and 1 with Epstein-Barr virus (1%). Herpesviridae-positive patients were more likely to be male, and have glaucoma. Glaucoma and pseudophakic eyes were significantly associated with CMV-positive eyes. PCR analysis of the anterior chamber fluid is important for the confirmation of the diagnosis of viral anterior uveitis. Cytomegalovirus anterior uveitis is not uncommon in patients in southern Taiwan, and it may follow an uneventful cataract extraction in immunocompetent patients. "
"Apart From Surgical Procedures, Another Important Point to Note in Lacrimal Canalicular Lacerations: Traumatic Retinal Tears.","Intraocular lens fixation surgery is associated with fluctuations in intraocular pressure. This may be significantly relevant in glaucoma patients. To assess short- and medium-term intraocular pressure control after trans-scleral intraocular lens fixation surgery in glaucoma patients. The charts of all glaucoma patients who underwent trans-scleral intraocular lens fixation surgery with at least 6months follow-up by a single surgeon between the years 2004 and 2017 were reviewed. Primary outcomes were intraocular pressure at 1day and 6months after surgery. Secondary outcome measures were hypotensive medication use and the need for further intraocular pressure lowering interventions. Eleven eyes of 10 patients were included in the analysis. Mean follow-up post intraocular lens fixation surgery was 54.6months. Mean intraocular pressure before, 6months, and last follow-up after intraocular lens fixation surgery was 15.85.3mmHg (range 10.6-25.3), 13.53.8mmHg (range 8-21, p=0.2), and 11.85.6 (range 6-21, p=0.09) on a mean of 2.31.6, 21.6 (p=0.23), and 1.71.5 (p=0.08) hypotensive medications, respectively. A pressure spike was noted in 5 of the 11 eyes on the first post-operative day (mean spike 15.2mmHg, range 6-23). Four of 11 eyes in the study (36%) needed additional interventions to control intraocular pressure by the 6-month point. One eye required the addition of two classes of topical medications, one eye required laser trabeculoplasty, and two eyes required trabeculectomy. Over a third of glaucomatous eyes required a change in the management of their disease in the early post-operative period. Close follow-up of patients undergoing trans-scleral intraocular lens fixation surgery is warranted. "
Coincidental Occurrence of Schnyder Corneal Dystrophy and Posterior Polymorphous Corneal Dystrophy Type 3.,"To compare long-term results between accelerated and standard corneal cross-linking protocols in the treatment of progressive keratoconus and compare their effectiveness between central (cone in the central 3mm) and peripheral (cone beyond 3mm) cases. In this randomized clinical trial, we compared 31 eyes treated with accelerated corneal cross-linking (18mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 5min) and 31 eyes treated with standard corneal cross-linking (3mW/cm<sup>2</sup>, 30min), 16 central and 11 peripheral keratoconus in each group. In this report, 4-year changes in vision, refraction, topography, corneal biomechanics, and corneal cell count were evaluated. Uncorrected distance visual acuity improvement was better with standard corneal cross-linking (0.190.30logMAR) than accelerated corneal cross-linking (0.080.35logMAR), but the intergroup difference was not statistically significant (p=0.283). Cylinder and spherical equivalent significantly increased similarly in both groups. Among topographic indices, anterior Kmax-3mm showed more reduction in standard corneal cross-linking than accelerated corneal cross-linking (1.351.39 vs 0.361.10D, p=0.011). Anterior Kmax-8mm reduced by 1.501.82 and 0.371.58D in the standard corneal cross-linking and accelerated corneal cross-linking groups, respectively (p=0.029). Compared to 18-month results, none of the indices at 4years showed any significant intergroup difference (all p>0.05). In cases with peripheral keratoconus, changes in anterior Kmax-3mm (+0.030.66 vs -1.171.15D, p=0.012) and anterior Kmax-8mm (+0.431.09 vs -1.571.40D, p=0.003) were greater with standard corneal cross-linking. In central cases, no significant intergroup difference was observed. At 4years after the procedure, standard corneal cross-linking offered better anterior corneal flattening in the center and periphery. These differences concerned cases of peripheral keratoconus, and the two protocols were similarly effective in central cases. Beyond the 18th month, the two protocols appeared to be similarly effective. "
"The Correlation Between Dry Eyes, Anxiety and Depression: The Sicca, Anxiety and Depression Study.","Physiological function and metabolic regulation are the most important outputs of circadian clock controls in mammals. Mitochondrial respiration and ROS production show rhythmic activity. Mitochondrial carriers, which are responsible for mitochondrial substance transfer, are vital for mitochondrial metabolism. Clock (Circadian Locomotor Output Cycles Kaput) is the first core circadian gene identified in mammalian animals. However, whether CLOCK protein can regulate mitochondrial functions via mitochondrial carriers is unclear. Here, we showed that CLOCK can bind to the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10. For further analysis, we established a Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cell line using CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing technology. Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cells showed disordered glucose homeostasis, increased oxidative stress levels, and damaged electron transport chains. Next, using an immunoprecipitation assay, we found that amino acids 43-84 and 169-210 in SLC25A10 are key sites that respond to CLOCK binding. Finally, forced expression of wild-type SLC25A10 in Slc25a10<sup>-/-</sup>-Hepa1-6 cells could compensate for the loss of SLC25A10; the decreased glucose metabolism, severe oxidative stress and damaged electron transport chain were recovered. In addition, a mutant Slc25a10 with changes in two key sites did not show a rescue effect. In conclusion, we identified a new protein-protein interaction mechanism in which CLOCK can directly regulate cell metabolism via the mitochondrial membrane transporter SLC25A10. Our study might provide some new insights into the relationship between circadian clock and mitochondrial metabolism. "
Corneal Edema Associated With Systemic Dopaminergic Agents.,"Despite the potential for adaptive optics scanning light ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) to quantify retinal disease progression at the cellular level, there remain few longitudinal studies investigating changes in cone density as a measure of disease progression. Here, we undertook a prospective, longitudinal study to investigate the variability of cone density measurements in normal subjects during a 2-year period. Fourteen eyes of nine subjects with no known ocular pathology were imaged both at a baseline and a 2-year follow-up visit by using confocal AOSLO at five retinal locations. Two-year affine-registered images were created to minimize the effects of intraframe distortions. Regions of interest were cropped from baseline, 2-year manually aligned, and 2-year affine-registered images. Cones were identified (graded masked) and cone density was extracted. Mean baseline cone density (cones/mm2) was 87,300, 62,200, 45,500, 28,700, and 18,200 at 190, 350, 500, 900, and 1500 m, respectively. The mean difference ( standard deviation [SD]) in cone density from baseline to 2-year affine-registered images was 1400 (1700), 100 (1800), 300 (800), 400 (800), and 1000 (2400) cones/mm2 at the same locations. The mean difference in cone density during the 2-year period was lower for affine-registered images than manually aligned images. There was no meaningful change in normal cone density during a 2-year period. Intervisit variability in cone density measurements decreased when intraframe distortions between time points were minimized. This variability must be considered when planning prospective longitudinal clinical trials using changes in cone density as an outcome measure for assessing retinal disease progression. "
Comparison of Small Incision Lenticule Extraction Surgery With and Without Cyclotorsion Error Correction for Patients With Astigmatism.,"To assess the variations induced by exercise in retinal vascular density (VD), foveal avascular zone (FAZ) area, and fractal dimension (FD) at the superficial (SCP) and deep (DCP) capillary plexa in healthy subjects by means of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCT-A). Consecutive healthy subjects were prospectively included into two groups, ranging in age from 18 to 29 years for group 1 and from 30 to 40 years for group 2. Data from 3  3-mm OCT-A acquisition centered on the macula at SCP and DCP (VD, FAZ area, and FD), heart rate, and systolic-diastolic blood pressure were collected before and after a 20-minute standardized physical exercise on a stationary bicycle. Both eyes of 32 healthy volunteers were prospectively included (15 in group 1 and 17 in group 2). Mean age was 27  7 years. In the overall analysis and for each group, a decrease of VD at the level of SCP and an increase of FD at the level of DCP were significant after exercise. A significant correlation was found between these modifications of retinal vascularization and the increase of systolic blood pressure induced by exercise. All cardiovascular parameters increased significantly with exercise. No significant difference was found between the two groups, and no incident was reported. A significant correlation was established between systemic cardiovascular modifications (reflected by systolic blood pressure) and local retinal vascularization changes at SCP during exercise. A rest period might be recommended before OCT-A data acquisition, as modifications of cardiovascular parameters could distort retinal vascular data. "
Bilateral Congenital Corneal Opacities as an Early-Onset Ocular Feature of Kabuki Syndrome.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate the concordance of a temporal raphe architecture estimated using optical coherence tomography (OCT) and MP-3 microperimetry. We enrolled 25 eyes with either an upper or lower glaucomatous hemifield defect, as detected on the Humphrey visual field 30-2 test. A structural temporal raphe was extrapolated from visible end points of retinal nerve fiber bundles present in a perimetrically normal hemiretina on an en face Spectralis OCT image. A functional temporal raphe was drawn as a line from the fovea to the border of at least a 10-dB difference in sensitivity, at vertically adjacent test points, with at least three consecutive pairs among 25 test points placed at 8 to 18 from the fovea (2 intervals) on the MP-3. An angle determined by the optic disc center, the fovea, and the temporal raphe line (the DFR angle) was calculated. Correlations and agreement of the OCT- and MP-3-derived DFR angles and factors affecting discordance of the two estimates were evaluated. Despite no significant demographic differences, the functional DFR angle (mean  SD, 171.8  3.5) was significantly larger than that of the structural DFR angle (166.5  3.2) in 14 eyes with upper hemifield defects and vice versa in 11 eyes with lower hemifield defects (163.4  3.0 vs. 170.5  3.2). The mean deviation was significantly associated with the functional and structural DFR angle difference in eyes with only upper hemifield defects. The structural temporal raphe was more deviated to the perimetrically normal hemiretina side than to the functional temporal raphe, thereby suggesting that a structural change may precede a functional loss.

Multiple sclerosis: clinical trial design 2019.,"Various profibrotic and proinflammatory cytokines have been found upregulated in uncomplicated primary retinal detachment (pRD), but without providing a uniform picture. Here, we compare the cyto- and chemokine profiles in pRD with and without proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) in an attempt to unravel relevant differences not in single cytokines, but in the cytokine profiles at diagnosis. Undiluted vitreous fluid (VF) was obtained at the beginning of surgery from 174 eyes with pRD without relevant PVR (maximally grade B; group 1; n = 81) and with moderate or advanced PVR requiring a gas tamponade (group 2; n = 49) or silicon oil filling (group 3; n = 44). VF of eyes undergoing macular hole (MH) surgery served as controls (group 4; n = 26). Forty-three cytokines were quantified in parallel using a multiplex cytokine analysis system (Bioplex). For all comparisons we applied Holm's correction to control for multiple comparisons. 44.9% of group 2 eyes presented grade C1 and 55.1% C2-C3, whereas 86.4% of group 3 eyes exhibited a PVR grade of C2-D. CCL19 was the only cytokine that displayed higher concentrations in the vitreous of eyes with PVR C1 compared to lower PVR grades. Eyes with PVR C2-D showed higher levels of CCL27, CXCL6, IL4, IL16, CXCL10, CCL8, CCL22, MIG/CXCL9, CCL15, CCL19, CCL 23 and CXCL12 compared to controls. Interestingly, no difference of cytokine levels was detected between C1 and C2-D PVR. CCL19 may represent a potential biomarker for early PVR progression that holds promise for future diagnostic and therapeutic applications. "
IgG4-positive Cell Quantification Distinguishes Between Inflammatory and Noninflammatory Diseases of the Orbit.,"Many moisturisers contain sun protection factors (SPF) equivalent to those found in sunscreens. However, there is a lack of research into how SPF moisturiser application compares to sunscreens in terms of coverage achieved and protection afforded. Previously we demonstrated that users incompletely covered their eyelid regions during routine sunscreen application. Here, we aimed to determine if SPF moisturiser users also displayed these tendencies. A study population of 84 participants (22 males, 62 females, age 18-57) were exposed to UV radiation and photographed using a tripod mounted UV sensitive DSLR camera on two separate visits. At visit one, images were acquired before and after applying either SPF30 sunscreen or moisturiser, then at visit two the study was repeated with the other formulation. Images were processed for facial landmark identification followed by segmentation mapping of hue saturation values to identify areas of the face that were/were not covered. Analyses revealed that application of moisturiser was significantly worse than sunscreen in terms area of the whole face missed (11.1% missed with sunscreen compared to 16.6% for SPF moisturiser p<0.001 paired t-test). This difference was primarily due to decreased coverage of the eyelid regions (14.0% missed with sunscreen, 20.9% moisturiser, p<0.001). Analysis of a post-study questionnaire revealed participants to be unaware of their incomplete coverage. Secondary analyses revealed improved coverage in males (p = 0.05), and, with moisturiser only, in participants with darker skin tones (p = 0.02). Together these data indicate that, despite potential advantages in terms of increased frequency of application of moisturiser, the areas of the face that are at higher cancer risk are likely not being protected, and that participants are unaware that they are at risk. As such, alternative sun-protection strategies should be promoted. "
Comparative Study Between Topical Gatifloxacin 0.5% and Moxifloxacin 0.5% as a Prophylactic Measure Before Intraocular Surgery.,"The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of golimumab (GOL) and certolizumab pegol (CZP) as additional treatment options for the treatment of uveitis. Patients with longstanding uveitis receiving either GOL or CZP were retrospectively evaluated in terms of frequency of ocular flares, drug survival, changes in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) and steroid-sparing effect. Twenty-one patients (30 eyes), 17 of whom being female, were enrolled in the study; 16 out of 21 patients had been previously treated with other tumour necrosis factor (TNF)- blockers. A significant reduction in ocular flares (from 128.6 bouts for 100 patients-year to 42.9 events for 100 patients-year) was observed between the 12 months prior to the start of GOL or CZP and the 12 months thereafter (p=0.01). The 36-month drug survival was 54.5% for CZP and 50.0% for GOL with no statistically significant differences between the two biologic agents. No differences were detected concerning BCVA values and the mean corticosteroid intake between baseline and the last follow-up. The safety profile was excellent. GOL and CZP represent effective and safe treatment choices for patients with uveitis also when unsuccessfully treated with other anti-TNF- drugs, permitting a significant reduction in the frequency of ocular flares and preserving visual function with a good long-term retention rate.

Interferon Alpha 2a and 2b in Ophthalmology: A Review.,"Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 3 (STAT3) gain-of-function germline mutations are associated with diverse clinical manifestations, including autoimmune cytopenia, lymphadenopathy, immunodeficiency, endocrinopathy, and enteropathy. We describe a new feature: raised intracranial pressure with papilledema. Report of two cases. The first patient had a de novo heterozygous c.2144C>T (p.Pro715Leu) mutation in the STAT3 gene. At age 1 she had papilledema with marked sheathing of the proximal vessels on the optic discs. Follow-up 8 years later showed chronic papilledema, cystoid macular edema, and vision loss. The second patient had a de novo heterozygous c.2147C>T (p.Thr716Met) mutation. At age 12 he developed papilledema, which recurred despite treatment. In both patients, repeated sampling of the cerebrospinal fluid demonstrated a lymphocytic pleocytosis. Papilledema can occur as a manifestation of STAT3 gain-of-function mutation, sometimes accompanied by prominent vascular sheathing and cystoid macular edema. The mechanism may be chronic meningeal infiltration by white blood cells, impairing cerebrospinal fluid absorption. "
"Anti-Inflammatory Effect of Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin, a Nuclear factor-B Inhibitor, on Endotoxin-Induced Uveitis in Rats In vivo and In vitro.","NanceHoran syndrome (NHS) is a rare Xlinked disorder with various clinical manifestations. The present study aimed to identify the pathogenic mutation causing NHS in a threegeneration Chinese family with 4 individuals presenting primarily with congenital cataracts. The genomic DNA of 5 individuals was collected, and family history and clinical information were recorded. Whole exome sequencing was performed on the proband, and candidate mutations were filtered by a series of screening processes and validated by Sanger sequencing. The identified pathogenic mutation was confirmed by cosegregation analysis. Finally, a novel frameshift mutation (NM_001291867.1: c.302dupA; p.Ala102fs) was identified in the NHS actin remodeling regulator (NHS) gene, which cosegregated with congenital cataracts in this family. Carrier females exhibited similar but milder clinical symptoms compared with the affected male. These clinical symptoms were consistent with the phenotypic features of the NHSassociated disease, NHS. In summary, the present study identified a novel NHS mutation in a Chinese family with atypical NHS; the results broaden the known pathogenic mutation spectrum of NHS and will aid in the genetic counseling of patients with NHS. The data from the present study also suggest that genetic analysis may be required for the diagnosis of this disease. "
Glutamatergic signaling between neurons and oligodendrocyte lineage cells: Is it synaptic or non-synaptic?,"Posterior capsular opacification (PCO) remains a major complication of cataract surgery and is the most common reason for loss of vision. PCO is primarily associated with uncontrolled proliferation of residual human lens epithelial cells (HLEs). Sanguinarine is a type of benzophenanthridine alkaloid extracted from the herbaceous plant Sanguinariacanadensis, which is widely used for its antimicrobial, antiinflammatory, antioxidative and antiproliferative properties. However, studies examining the effect of sanguinarine on HLEs and the underlying mechanism are scarce. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of sanguinarine on HLEs. An MTT assay was used to determine the effect of sanguinarine on cell viability. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate cell apoptosis, and the mitochondrial membrane potential and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. A caspase 3/7 activity assay was also used to evaluate cell apoptosis, while western blotting was performed to determine protein levels. The results demonstrated that sanguinarine exerted an antiproliferative effect by inducing ROS, and caused cell apoptosis via mitochondrial and caspasedependent pathways. Treatment with sanguinarine led to the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Sanguinarine also significantly increased the phosphorylation levels of cJun Nterminal kinase and p38, which indicated the involvement of the mitogenactivated protein kinase signaling pathway. These results suggested that sanguinarine may have a noteworthy proapoptotic effect on HLEs, and may be used as a potential drug for PCO or even cataract prevention. "
Morbidity in a longitudinal cohort of children residing in villages randomized to 6 monthly treatment with azithromycin versus placebo.,"In recent years, gut microbiota (GM) has emerged as a key factor in shaping the pathogenesis of a vast array of immune-mediated diseases, as well as in the response to immune-based treatments such as anti PD-1 and anti-CTLA4 therapy or influenza vaccination. In addition, GM has a significant role in the immune system development and is fundamental in developing mucosal immunity. Recent data suggest that GM plays an important role in the immune system of immune deficient patients. GM status has a remarkable impact on the immune system and in immune deficient patients; this can lead to important consequences. Prebiotics are indeed a promising candidate in restoring GM homeostasis and improving immunity. Antibiotics are also capable of altering the microbial equilibrium. "
Cluster analysis of computerized visual field and optical coherence tomography-ganglion cell complex defects in high intraocular pressure patients or early stage glaucoma.,"To observe the effects of acupuncture combined with phacoemulsification for cataract with glaucoma. Sixty-eight patients with cataract and angle-closure glaucoma were randomly divided into an observation group and a control group, 34 cases in each one. The patients in the control group were treated with phacoemulsification. Based on the treatment in the control group, the patients in the observation group were treated with <i>tuina</i> and acupuncture at acupoints around eyes; the treatment was given once every other day, and 15-day treatment constituted a course, and 2 courses (60 days) were given. The intraocular pressure (IOP), visual acuity, pain severity, aqueous outflow (F value) and clinical symptoms were observed in the two groups before treatment and after 1 d, 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment. The IOP after 1 d, 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment in the observation group was lower than that in the control group (all <i>P</i><0.05), while the visual acuity after 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment in the observation group was higher than that in the control group (all <i>P</i><0.05). Compared before treatment, the IOP was significantly decreased after 1 d, 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment in the two groups, and the visual acuity was significantly increased after 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment in the two groups (all <i>P</i><0.05). The pain scores and F value after 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment in the observation group were lower than those in the control group (all <i>P</i><0.05). Compared before treatment, the pain scores and F value after 7 d, 30 d and 60 d of treatment were significantly reduced in the two groups (all <i>P</i><0.05). After 60 d of treatment, the number of patients who presented general clinical symptoms in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). Based on phacoemulsification, acupuncture and <i>tuina</i> could significantly reduce the IOP and F value, relieve pain and improve visual acuity in patients with cataract and glaucoma. "
The identification of a RNA splice variant in TULP1 in two siblings with early-onset photoreceptor dystrophy.,"<i>Wei</i> \'s triple nine needling therapy is the crucial acupuncture prescription in treatment of eye diseases in <i>Wei</i> \'s academic school of ophthalmology. ""<i>Wei</i> \'s triple nine needling therapy"" includes the three points near to the eyes, the three groups of points for penetrating acupuncture around the eyes and the acupoint selection based on the general differentiation of syndrome. In this paper, the acupoint selection and the thinking of acupoint combination were introduced in the treatment of optic nerve disease on the base of the theory of ""<i>Wei</i> \'s triple nine needling"" prescription. The specific needling manipulations at different regions involved in the triple needling procedure were explained in detail. It is proposed that the acupoints are combined and the correct needling manipulations selected rationally in compliance with the illness condition and the syndrome characteristics to ensure maximally the clinical effects of ""<i>Wei</i> \'s triple nine needling therapy"".

Time for a makeover-cosmetics regulation in the United States.,"To analyze the effects of intradermal needling for pain and tear film stability in patients after pterygium excision. A total of 76 patients (98 affected eyes) with primary pterygium were randomly divided into an observation group (38 cases, 53 affected eyes) and a control group (38 cases, 45 affected eyes).In the control group, only pterygium resection was performed, in the observation group, intradermal needling after pterygium resection was applied at Cuanzhu (BL 2), Yuyao (EX-HN 4), Taiyang (EX-HN 5), Sibai (ST 2), Hegu (LI 4), removed after 24 h and changed three times a week. The pain level of 3 days after surgery, dry eye symptoms, the basic tear secretion test (Schirmer-), and the tear-break time (BUT) changes before surgery, 2 weeks after surgery and 4 weeks after surgery were compared between the two groups, and the clinical efficacy was evaluated. The pain level of 3 days after surgery in the observation group was significantly lower than that in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). The dry eye symptom scores at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after surgery in the two groups were significantly lower than those before surgery (all <i>P</i><0.05), and the dry eye symptom scores in the observation group were significantly lower than those in the control group (both <i>P</i><0.05). The Schirmer- test at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after surgery was significantly prolonged than that before surgery(all <i>P</i><0.05), and the Schirmer- test in the observation group was significantly longer than that in the control group (both <i>P</i><0.05). The BUT at 2 weeks and 4 weeks after surgery in the two groups was significantly longer than that before surgery (all <i>P</i><0.05), and the BUT in the observation group was significantly longer than that in the control group (both <i>P</i><0.05). The total effective rate in the observation group was 89.5% (34/38), which was higher than 71.1% (27/38) in the control group (<i>P</i><0.05). Intradermal needling can effectively reduce the pain level of patients after pterygium resection, improve dry eye symptoms, promote the secretion of tears and improve the tear film stability. "
Domain-specific distribution of gap junctions defines cellular coupling to establish a vascular relay in the retina.,"The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the literature regarding prophylactic treatment of intraocular pressure (IOP) elevation after uncomplicated cataract surgery to provide an evidence-based guideline for cataract surgeons. The relevant literature was identified in EMBASE and PubMed. The risk of bias was assessed according to the 'Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions' and the ROBINS-I tool. The Grading of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria were used to rate the quality of evidence, and relevant data were systematically extracted to evaluate the pressure-lowering effect of the active substances. The primary outcomes for this systematic review were the absolute and relative pressure-lowering effect of the different drugs after 3-8hr and 1day after surgery. In total, 23 randomized controlled trials and one nonrandomized controlled study consisting of 45 treatment arms with 14 different active substances were included in the qualitative synthesis. According to the GRADE criteria, nine trials were graded as 'high' quality of evidence, 12 trials as 'moderate', while three trials were given the grade 'low' quality of evidence. The primary outcomes showed most consistency between the trials, which studied the effect of timolol, and presented a relative effect from 18.6% to 29.6% at 3-8hr and 9.8% to 23.6% at day 1. This systematic review indicates that timolol, latanoprost and travoprost alone or medications containing timolol as an additive active substance, such as dorzolamide+timolol, brinzolamide+timolol and brimonidine+timolol, are characterized by a good relative IOP-lowering effect, which can be gained by a single dose postoperatively.

[Association of EphA2 gene polymorphisms with susceptibility to age-related cataract among ethnic Han Chinese from Hubei].,"External cephalic version (ECV) should be offered for patients presenting with a noncephalic pregnancy that are willing to deliver vaginally. Various reports have evaluated predictors for successful ECV. Yet, none have reported a single-operator large cohort experience. We aim to analyze the outcome of referrals for ECV. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data. We performed a multivariate analysis of data with respect to ECV procedures performed by a single operator in a 6-year period. Maternal and fetal characteristics were compared between ECV success and failure groups. Six hundred and two women underwent ECV. Of them, ECV was successful in 432 (71.7%). A multivariate binary logistic regression model demonstrated that high liquor volume was a predictor of ECV success (Adj OR 1.17 [95% CI 1.09-1.26]). Failure of ECV was correlated with anterior placenta (0.44 [0.56-0.76]) and nulliparity (0.21 [0.11-0.36]). Adverse events were rare and mostly minor, occurring in 1% of procedures. ECV has a high success rate and a low complication rate, enabling vaginal birth and avoiding cesarean. The role of manipulation of modifiable determinants such as liquor volume should be further assessed in future studies. "
[Clinical features and genetic analysis of a pedigree affected with non-muscle myosin heavy chain 9 gene related disease].,"We thank Dr del Giudice<sup>1</sup> for his interest in our recent article in Clinical and Experimental Dermatology.<sup>2</sup> Our review encompassed the topic of oral ulceration as a manifestation of secondary syphilis and provided by way of example the case histories of two patients. While we agree that the lesions shown in Fig. <sup>2</sup> are raised above the mucosal surface and are in their view 'vegetating', we described the lesions as 'mucous patches'. When we biopsied a mucous patch, as shown in Fig. <sup>2</sup> , there was a discontinuous epithelium consistent with an ulcer. Thus, whether or not the lesion is described as a mucous patch or vegetating lesion, we have demonstrated ulceration. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved. "
Posterior segment assessment in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome.,"To estimate light exposure changes during cataract surgery through intraoperative images simulated from the ""patient\'s perspective"" using an animal model. In this experimental study, a 3-mm maculostomy was performed through the posterior globe's surface of 15 porcine eyes. Eyes were fixated to a glass slide and placed over an iPad camera. Video footage of a cataract surgery was obtained through the maculostomy for each eye, keeping light exposure parameters and focus constant. Seventy-five images, five from each eye, were extracted at pre-determined points, and mean gray value (MGV), a light intensity measure, was calculated. Differences in MGV between discrete surgical steps were evaluated using multiple one-sample t-tests. This technique allowed for the capture of a full-length cataract surgery through a 3-mm maculostomy. MGV range was 14.21-132.51. Light intensity was similar across surgeries and varied greatly through each procedure. A 24% decrease in MGV between post-hydrodissection and post-phacoemulsification stages was noted (difference -18.36; 95% CI -30.50 to -6.22; p value=0.006). A 22.4% decrease in light intensity was noted after phacoemulsification in comparison to the starting image (MGV difference -16.78; 95% CI -32.45 to -1.12; p value: 0.0375). Light intensity was similar at the start and end of surgery (difference -7.15; 95% CI -19.35 to +5.05; p value=0.229). Light intensity changes through different steps of cataract surgery and may be minimal after phacoemulsification completion. This video and data may serve as informational and educational tools for surgeons and patients. "
Update on the Clinical Approach to Spatial Neglect.,"Current outcome measures do not adequately address the esthetic aspect of the surgical outcome of anterior blepharotomy for Graves' ophthalmopathy. This study aims to highlight the role of tarsal platform show (TPS) in optimizing the esthetic outcome of graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy for dysthyroid upper eyelid retraction in an ethnic Chinese population. The records of patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy who underwent anterior blepharotomy for upper eyelid retraction over a period of 30months were retrospectively reviewed. Fifty-five patients (77 eyelids) with upper eyelid retraction underwent anterior blepharotomy. A statistically significant decrease in marginal reflex distance (MRD<sub>1</sub>) and lagophthalmos and significant increase in TPS following anterior blepharotomy was observed. A significantly higher proportion of patients who underwent unilateral anterior blepharotomy had TPS asymmetry post-operatively as compared to the bilateral group (p<0.001). Using logistic regression, the study found that for every 1-mm change in MRD<sub>1</sub>, there was approximately a 1.045-mm change in TPS. The mean percentage increase in TPS observed in our study was 303.1191% due to the low pre-operative TPS seen in Asian patients. To achieve the most ideal surgical outcome in graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy, the surgeon will need to consider not only eyelid height but also the subsequent TPS change. The surgeon needs to be mindful of the relationship between MRD<sub>1</sub> change and TPS change to optimize esthetic outcome as well as symmetry. Special considerations need to be taken in unilateral cases as well as patients with low pre-operative TPS. "
Investigation of parameters that determine Nano-DC vaccine transport.,"Optimal treatment of tumors with orbital invasion may exceed the competences of an individual medical specialty and require interdisciplinary cooperation. The aim of this article is to present an interdisciplinary treatment concept based on the examples of intraorbital hemangioma and squamous cell carcinoma of the paranasal sinuses infiltrating the orbit. In addition to adetailed medical history and acomplete ophthalmological examination, adetailed imaging technique with standardized echography and tomography methods such as orbital thin-slice CT and/or in many cases MRI is essential for the primary classification of an intraorbital pathology. Depending on the type of pathology, apurely surgical procedure involving various disciplines such as ophthalmology, otorhinolaryngology, maxillofacial surgery, neurosurgery, and pathology, or an interdisciplinary treatment regimen including (neo)adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy is necessary. Orbital tumors have awide range of potential pathologies, requiring complex surgical procedures and multimodal therapies. In case of infiltration of the paranasal sinuses or intracranial structures, an interdisciplinary team including neuroradiologists, oral-maxillofacial surgeons, otorhinolaryngologists, neurosurgeons, radiation therapists, ophthalmologists, pathologists, oncologists, and psycho-oncologists is essential for successful treatment.

Comparison of Toric and Spherical Orthokeratology Lenses in Patients with Astigmatism.,"We systematically compare the intermodality and interreader agreement in age-related macular degeneration(AMD)-associated neovascularization assessment for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images obtained using different slabs. We collected data from 48 patients (50 eyes) with type 1 or 2 neovascularization (NV) and AMD. Subjects were imaged with a swept source (SS)-OCTA system. For each eye, three OCTA en face images generated from three different slabs were exported: (1) the outer retina to choriocapillaris (ORCC) image, (2) the choriocapillaris (CC) image, and (3) the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)-RPE fit image. Each image was graded by two readers to assess interreader variability and a single image for each modality was used to assess the intermodality variability. In the assessment of type 1 NV, mean absolute interreader difference between measured NV areas was 0.19, 0.30, and 0.16 mm<sup>2</sup> for ORCC, CC, and RPE-RPE fit images, respectively. Similarly, the coefficient of repeatability (CR) and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) indicated that the RPE-RPE fit assessment was characterized by the highest interreader reproducibility. Type 1 NV size was 0.58 mm<sup>2</sup> (0.30-1.60 mm<sup>2</sup>) on ORCC images, 0.00 mm<sup>2</sup> (0.00-0.36 mm<sup>2</sup>) on CC images (<i>P</i> = 0.002 vs. ORCC), and 0.62 mm<sup>2</sup> (0.31-2.03 mm<sup>2</sup>) on RPE-RPE fit images (<i>P</i> < 0.0001 vs. CC, <i>P</i> = 0.041 vs. ORCC). The RPE-RPE fit OCTA images have the highest interreader agreement and deliver larger measurements in type 1 lesions. OCTA imaging may be used in ongoing trials of potential novel treatments for NV.

"Corrigendum to ""The Role of Medications in Causing Dry Eye"".","Particle-mediated gene transfer has been used in animal models to study the morphology and connectivity of retinal ganglion cells. The aim of the present study was to apply this method to transfect ganglion cells in postmortem human retina. Postmortem human eyes from male and female donors aged 40 to 76 years old were obtained within 15 hours after death. In addition, two marmoset retinas were obtained immediately after death. Ganglion cells were transfected with an expression plasmid for the postsynaptic density 95 protein conjugated to green or yellow fluorescent protein. Retinas were cultured for 3 days, fixed and then processed with immunohistochemical markers to reveal their stratification in the inner plexiform layer. The retinas maintained their morphology and immunohistochemical properties for at least 3 days in culture. Bipolar and ganglion cell morphology was comparable to that observed in noncultured tissue. The quality of transfected cells in human retina was similar to that in freshly enucleated marmoset eyes. Based on dendritic field size and stratification, at least 11 morphological types of retinal ganglion cell were distinguished. Particle-mediated gene transfer allows efficient targeting of retinal ganglion cells in cultured postmortem human retina. The translational value of this methodology lies in the provision of an in vitro platform to study structural and connectivity changes in human eye diseases that affect the integrity and organization of cells in the retina.

Visual Performance after a Unilateral or Bilateral Implantation of Enlarged Depth-of-Focus Intraocular Lens in Patients with Cataract: A Prospective Clinical Trial.,"To quantify interquadrant differences in anterior chamber angle (ACA) configuration assessed on gonioscopy, EyeCam, and anterior segment optical coherence tomography (AS-OCT) in a cohort of Chinese Americans. Subjects aged 50 years or older were recruited from the Chinese American Eye Study (CHES), a population-based epidemiologic study in Los Angeles, CA. Each subject underwent a complete ocular exam, including gonioscopy, EyeCam, and AS-OCT, under dark ambient lighting. Gonioscopy and AS-OCT imaging and EyeCam image grading were performed by trained ophthalmologists. Seven hundred nine eyes from 709 subjects were analyzed. Less anatomic variation among the quadrants was detected on gonioscopy and EyeCam compared with AS-OCT (<i>P</i> < 0.05). The mean gonioscopy grade, EyeCam grade, and AS-OCT measurement for each quadrant varied by up to 10.3%, 6.4%, and 46.2% of the superior quadrant value, respectively. There were significant interquadrant differences (<i>P</i> < 0.05) among mean AOD750 measurements when grouping by quadrant and gonioscopy or EyeCam grade. Mean AOD750 measurements were smallest for the superior quadrant by between 14.3% and 38.1% and 17.4% and 37.9% on gonioscopy and EyeCam, respectively, compared with other quadrants. Gonioscopy and EyeCam significantly underrepresent anatomic variations of the ACA compared with AS-OCT. Gonioscopy or EyeCam grades from different quadrants do not appear to be comparable or interchangeable, which supports reconsideration of current definitions and methods used to diagnose and manage primary angle closure disease. AS-OCT imaging raises concerns about current clinical definitions and methods that rely gonioscopy or EyeCam to assess the ACA. "
Modeling a Telemedicine Screening Program for Diabetic Retinopathy in Iran and Implementing a Pilot Project in Tehran Suburb.,"The aim of this study was to explore the relationship between compliance with preoperative posturing advice and progression of macula-on retinal detachment (RD) and to evaluate whether head positioning or head motility contributes most to RD progression. Sixteen patients with macula-on RD were enrolled, admitted to the ward, and instructed to posture preoperatively. The primary outcome parameter was compliance, which was defined as the average head orientation deviation from advised positioning. Secondary outcome parameters included the average rotational and linear head acceleration. The head orientation and acceleration were measured with a head-mounted inertial measurement unit (IMU). Optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging was performed at baseline and during natural interruptions of posturing for meals and toilet visits to measure RD progression toward the fovea. The Spearman correlation coefficient with RD progression was 0.37 (<i>P</i> = 0.001, <i>r</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.13) for compliance, 0.52 (<i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>r</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.27) for rotational acceleration, and 0.49 (<i>P</i> < 0.001, <i>r</i><sub>s</sub><sup>2</sup> = 0.24) for linear acceleration. The correlation coefficient between RD progression and rotational acceleration was statistically significantly higher than the correlation coefficient between RD progression and compliance (<i>P</i> = 0.034). The strength of the correlation between RD progression and compliance was moderate. However, the correlation between RD progression and rotational and linear acceleration was much stronger. Preoperative posturing is effective by reducing head movements rather than enforcing head positioning. Monitoring the efficacy of preoperative posturing in macula-on RD using OCT and IMU measurements shows that a new and combined application of these technologies leads to clinically relevant insights.

An Intra-Vaginal Zinc Oxide Tetrapod Nanoparticles (ZOTEN) and Genital Herpesvirus Cocktail Can Provide a Novel Platform for Live Virus Vaccine.,"We test if differential artery-vein analysis can increase the performance of optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) detection and classification of sickle cell retinopathy (SCR). This observational case series was conducted in a tertiary-retina practice. Color fundus and OCTA images were collected from 20 control and 48 SCR subjects. Fundus data were collected from fundus imaging devices, and SD-OCT and corresponding OCTA data were acquired using a spectral-domain OCT (SD-OCT) angiography system. For each patient, color fundus image-guided artery-vein classification was conducted in the OCTA image. Traditional mean blood vessel tortuosity (m-BVT) and mean blood vessel caliber (m-BVC) in OCTA images were quantified for control and SCR groups. Artery BVC (a-BVC), vein BVC (v-BVC), artery BVT (a-BVT), and vein BVT (v-BVT) were calculated; and then the artery-vein ratio of BVC (AVR-BVC) and artery-vein ratio of BVT (AVR-BVT) were quantified for comparative analysis. We evaluated 40 control and 85 SCR images in this study. The color fundus image-guided artery-vein classification had 97.02% accuracy for differentiating arteries and veins in OCTA. Differential artery-vein analysis provided significant improvement (<i>P</i> < 0.05) in detecting and classifying SCR stages compared to traditional mean blood vessel analysis. AVR-BVT and AVR-BVC showed significant (<i>P</i> < 0.001) correlation with SCR severity. Differential artery-vein analysis can significantly improve the performance of OCTA detection and classification of SCR. AVR-BVT is the most sensitive feature that can classify control and mild SCR. SCR and other retinovascular diseases result in changes to the caliber and tortuosity appearance of arteries and veins separately. Differential artery-vein analysis can improve the performance of SCR detection and stage classification. "
Establishing and regulating the composition of cilia for signal transduction.,"Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is characterized by arterial and venous thrombosis, pregnancy morbidity and fetal loss caused by pathogenic autoantibodies directed against phospholipids (PL) and PL-cofactors. Isolated neurological APS may represent a significant diagnostic challenge, as epidemiological, clinical and neuroimaging features may overlap with those of multiple sclerosis (MS). In an open view, MS could be considered as an organ-specific anti-lipid (phospholipid and glycosphingolipid associated proteins) disease, in which autoreactive B cells and CD8+ T cells play a dominant role in its pathophysiology. In MS, diverse autoantibodies against the lipid-protein cofactors of the myelin sheath have been described, whose pathophysiologic role has not been fully elucidated. We carried out a review to select clinical studies addressing the prevalence of antiphospholipid (aPL) autoantibodies in the so-called MS-like syndrome. The reported prevalence ranged between 2% and 88%, particularly aCL and a2GPI, with predominant IgM isotype and suggesting worse MS prognosis. Secondarily, an updated summary of current knowledge on the pathophysiological mechanisms and events responsible for these conditions is presented. We draw attention to the clinical relevance of diagnosing isolated neurological APS. Prompt and accurate diagnosis and antiaggregant and anticoagulant treatment of APS could be vital to prevent or at least reduce APS-related morbidity and mortality. "
Whole exome sequencing identifies novel USH2A mutations and confirms Usher syndrome 2 diagnosis in Chinese retinitis pigmentosa patients.,"Leptin is secreted by adipocytes to regulate appetite and body weight. Recent studies have reported that tanycytes actively transport circulating leptin across the brain barrier into the hypothalamus, and are required for normal levels of hypothalamic leptin signaling. However, direct evidence for leptin receptor (<i>LepR</i>) expression is lacking, and the effect of tanycyte-specific deletion of <i>LepR</i> has not been investigated. In this study, we analyze the expression and function of the tanycytic <i>LepR</i> in mice. Using single-molecule fluorescent <i>in situ</i> hybridization (smfISH), RT-qPCR, single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq), and selective deletion of the <i>LepR</i> in tanycytes, we are unable to detect expression of <i>LepR</i> in the tanycytes. Tanycyte-specific deletion of <i>LepR</i> likewise did not affect leptin-induced pSTAT3 expression in hypothalamic neurons, regardless of whether leptin was delivered by intraperitoneal or intracerebroventricular injection. Finally, we use activity-regulated scRNA-Seq (act-Seq) to comprehensively profile leptin-induced changes in gene expression in all cell types in mediobasal hypothalamus. Clear evidence for leptin signaling is only seen in endothelial cells and subsets of neurons, although virtually all cell types show leptin-induced changes in gene expression. We thus conclude that <i>LepR</i> expression in tanycytes is either absent or undetectably low, that tanycytes do not directly regulate hypothalamic leptin signaling through a <i>LepR</i>-dependent mechanism, and that leptin regulates gene expression in diverse hypothalamic cell types through both direct and indirect mechanisms.

Aripiprazole-induced persistent hiccup: a case report and review of the literature.,"Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNTs) are the most potent toxins known and cause the life threatening disease botulism. Sensitive and broad detection is extremely challenging due to the toxins' high potency and molecular heterogeneity with several serotypes and more than 40 subtypes. The toxicity of BoNT is mediated by enzymatic cleavage of different synaptic proteins involved in neurotransmitter release at serotype-specific cleavage sites. Hence, active BoNTs can be monitored and distinguished in vitro by detecting their substrate cleavage products. In this work, we developed a comprehensive panel of monoclonal neoepitope antibodies (Neo-mAbs) highly specific for the newly generated N- and/or C-termini of the substrate cleavage products of BoNT serotypes A to F. The Neo-mAbs were implemented in a set of three enzymatic assays for the simultaneous detection of two BoNT serotypes each by monitoring substrate cleavage on colour-coded magnetic Luminex-beads. For the first time, all relevant serotypes could be detected in parallel by a routine in vitro activity assay in spiked serum and food samples yielding excellent detection limits in the range of the mouse bioassay or better (0.3-80pg/mL). Therefore, this work represents a major step towards the replacement of the mouse bioassay for botulism diagnostics. "
Human red and green cone opsins are O-glycosylated at an N-terminal Ser/Thr-rich domain conserved in vertebrates.,"In the research field of extracellular vesicles (EVs), the use of fetal bovine serum (FBS) depleted of EVs for in vitro studies is advocated to eliminate the confounding effects of media derived EVs. EV-depleted FBS may either be prepared by ultracentrifugation or purchased commercially. Nevertheless, these preparations do not guarantee an RNA-free FBS for in vitro use. In this study we address the RNA contamination issue, of small non-coding (nc)RNA in vesicular or non-vesicular fractions of FBS, ultracentrifugation EV-depleted FBS, commercial EV-depleted FBS, and in our recently developed filtration based EV-depleted FBS. Commercially available serum- and xeno-free defined media were also screened for small ncRNA contamination. Our small ncRNA sequencing data showed that all EV-depleted media and commercially available defined media contained small ncRNA contaminants. Out of the different FBS preparations studied, our ultrafiltration-based method for EV depletion performed the best in depleting miRNAs. Certain miRNAs such miR-122 and miR-203a proved difficult to remove completely and were found in all media. Compared to miRNAs, other small ncRNA (snRNA, Y RNA, snoRNA, and piRNA) were difficult to eliminate from all the studied media. Additionally, our tested defined media contained miRNAs and other small ncRNAs, albeit at a much lower level than in serum preparations. Our study showed that no media is free of small ncRNA contaminants. Therefore, in order to screen for baseline RNA contamination in culturing media, RNA sequencing data should be carefully controlled by adding a media sample as a control. This should be a mandatory step before performing cell culture experiments in order to eliminate the confounding effects of media. "
Long Non-coding RNA H19 Promotes Corneal Neovascularization by Targeting MicroRNA-29c.,"Antitumor T-cell responses raised by frontline therapies such as chemotherapy, radiation, tumor cell vaccines, and viroimmunotherapy tend to be weak, both quantitatively (low frequency) and qualitatively (low affinity). We show here that T cells that recognize tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) can directly kill tumor cells if used at high effector-to-target ratios. However, when these tumor-reactive T cells were present at suboptimal ratios, direct T cell-mediated tumor cell killing was reduced and the ability of tumor cells to evolve away from a co-applied therapy (oncolytic or suicide gene therapy) was promoted. This T cell-mediated increase in therapeutic resistance was associated with C to T transition mutations that are characteristic of APOBEC3 cytosine deaminase activity and was induced through a TNF and PKC-dependent pathway. Short hairpin RNA inhibition of endogenous APOBEC3 reduced rates of tumor escape from oncolytic virus or suicide gene therapy to those seen in the absence of antitumor T-cell coculture. Conversely, overexpression of human APOBEC3B in tumor cells enhanced escape from suicide gene therapy and oncolytic virus therapy both in vitro and in vivo. Our data suggest that weak affinity or low frequency T-cell responses against tumor antigens may contribute to the ability of tumor cells to evolve away from frontline therapies. We conclude that immunotherapies need to be optimized as early as possible so that, if they do not kill the tumor completely, they do not promote treatment resistance. "
"Insidious-onset, non-wheezing carteolol-induced asthma in an atopic patient without asthma history.","Idiopathic paediatric uveitis (IPU) and juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis (JIA-U) are the two most common entities in paediatric uveitis. This study addressed the possible association of IPU and JIA-U with genes that had been shown earlier to be associated with juvenile idiopathic arthritis. We carried out a case-control association study involving 286 IPU, 134 JIA-U patients and 743 healthy individuals. A total of 84 candidate single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in 60 genes were selected for this study. The MassARRAY platform and iPLEX Gold Genotyping Assay was used to genotype 83 candidate SNPs and the remaining SNP (rs27293) was analysed using the TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay. No evidence was found for an association of the candidate polymorphisms tested with IPU. Six SNPs (PRM1/rs11074967, JAZF1/rs73300638, IRF5/rs2004640, MEFV/rs224217, PSMA3/rs2348071 and PTPN2/rs7234029) showed an association with JIA-U (p<1.010<sup>-2</sup>). Our findings showed associations of six SNPs (PRM1/rs11074967, JAZF1/rs73300638, IRF5/rs2004640, MEFV/rs224217, PSMA3/rs2348071 and PTPN2/rs7234029) with JIA-U. No association was detected between the 84 tested SNPs and IPU. "
Ocular toxocariasis: atypical clinical course.,"To investigate the topographic relationship between macular superficial microvessel density (SMD) and macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer (GCIPL) thickness in eyes with glaucoma-suspect (GS) and early normal-tension glaucoma (NTG). A total of 86 eyes of 86 patients with early NTG (standard automated perimetry mean deviation >-5.5 decibels) and a total of 25 eyes of 25 patients with GS were retrospectively reviewed. All of the subjects underwent optical coherence tomography (OCT) and OCT angiography (OCTA) scan. On the OCTA scan images, macular SMD was analysed by customised software. In GS and patients with early NTG, macular GCIPL thickness showed significant correlations with macular SMD in the superotemporal (ST), inferotemporal (IT) and inferoinferior (II) sectors (<i>r</i><i>=</i>0.191, 0.373 and 0.346 for ST, IT and II sector, respectively). Additionally, circumpapillary retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL) thickness and macular SMD showed significant correlations between the ST sector of the macula and the 1, 9 clock-hour peripapillary regions and between the IT and II sectors of the macula and the 6, 7, 8 clock-hour peripapillary regions. The IT sector macular SMD showed fair diagnostic power (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC] = 0.758) and showed high diagnostic power when combined with IT sector macular GCIPL thickness (AUROC=0.954). Sectoral macular SMD showed topographic correlations with macular GCIPL thickness and circumpapillary RNFL thickness in patients with GS and early-stage NTG. Macular SMD analysis is potentially useful in the clinical evaluation of early glaucoma. "
Intraretinal haemorrhagic cyst mimicking choroidal haemangioma.,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by motor, cognitive, and behavioural changes. One of the earliest changes to occur in HD is a reduction in cannabinoid 1 receptor (CB<sub>1</sub>) levels in the striatum, which is strongly correlated with HD pathogenesis. CB<sub>1</sub> positive allosteric modulators (PAM) enhance receptor affinity for, and efficacy of activation by, orthosteric ligands, including the endocannabinoids anandamide and 2-arachidonoylglycerol. The goal of this study was to determine whether the recently characterized CB<sub>1</sub> allosteric modulators GAT211 (racemic), GAT228 (R-enantiomer), and GAT229 (S-enantiomer), affected the signs and symptoms of HD. GAT211, GAT228, and GAT229 were evaluated in normal and HD cell models, and in a transgenic mouse model of HD (7-week-old male R6/2 mice, 10mg/kg/d, 21d, i.p.). GAT229 was a CB<sub>1</sub> PAM that improved cell viability in HD cells and improved motor coordination, delayed symptom onset, and normalized gene expression in R6/2 HD mice. GAT228 was an allosteric agonist that did not enhance endocannabinoid signaling or change symptom progression in R6/2 mice. GAT211 displayed intermediate effects between its enantiomers. The compounds used here are not drugs, but probe compounds used to determine the potential utility of CB<sub>1</sub> PAMs in HD. Changes in gene expression, and not protein, were quantified in R6/2 HD mice because HD pathogenesis is associated with dysregulation of mRNA levels. The data presented here provide the first proof of principle for the use of CB<sub>1</sub> PAMs to treat the signs and symptoms of HD. "
Benefits of noninferiority studies in ophthalmology.,"Psychosis-a cardinal symptom of schizophrenia-has been associated with a failure to appropriately create or use stored regularities about past states of the world to guide the interpretation of incoming information, which leads to abnormal perceptions and beliefs. The visual system provides a test bed for investigating the role of prior experience and prediction, as accumulated knowledge of the world informs our current perception. More specifically, the strength of visual aftereffects, illusory percepts that arise after prolonged viewing of a visual stimulus, can serve as a valuable measure of the influence of prior experience on current visual processing. In this paper, we review findings from a largely older body of work on visual aftereffects in schizophrenia, attempt to reconcile discrepant findings, highlight the role of antipsychotic medication, consider mechanistic interpretations for behavioral effects, and propose directions for future research.

Effects of decentration and tilt at different orientations on the optical performance of a rotationally asymmetric multifocal intraocular lens.,"To report a surgical technique and the surgical outcomes of individualized penetrating keratoplasty (PK) using edge-trimmed glycerol-preserved donor corneas for perforated corneal ulcers. Fourteen perforated eyes from 14 patients who underwent individualized PK using edge-trimmed glycerol-preserved donor corneas, were included in the retrospective study. The perforations were mainly 1-2mm in size except for one that was 2.54mm. Three patients were treated with PK; one patient was treated with PK and a conjunctival flap; ten patients who had large ulcer areas were treated with PK combined with lamellar keratoplasty (LK). Donor corneas were preserved in sterile pure glycerol at -80C. Corneal grafts were specially edge-trimmed to match the perforation, and then sutured onto the recipient bed avoiding the visual axis. All 14 patients recovered anatomical integrity without reinfections of the treated eyes. All patients had improved graft transparency and uncorrected visual acuity after surgery. Among them, four patients suffered from short-term postoperative complications and recovered quickly; four patients suffered from long-term postoperative complications, of them, one was performed further treatment. After individualized PK using glycerol-preserved donor corneas, all perforated corneal ulcers were stably controlled by the end of the follow-up period. This modified surgical technique can be a potential treatment choice for patients with perforated corneal ulcers. "
"Protocol for a systematic review, meta-analysis, and trial sequential analysis of clinical outcomes following accelerated versus conventional corneal collagen cross-linking for corneal ectasia.","Very recent research results have demonstrated that the ""Rostock Artificial Eye Collection"" - assembled 150 years ago with 132 glass modelled exhibits of anterior segment pathologies - is mainly based on the figures of the Atlas of Ophthalmology published by Antoine Pierre Demours in 1818. This article focusses on the analyses of the imaging techniques of this atlas. Present knowledge implies that the author used different colour etching concepts which were partially re-coloured individually. In the opinion of contemporaries, the figures of Demours\' atlas represent the climax of scientific imaging techniques. In the academic literature, it is still described as a ""recent remarkable masterpiece"", even 100 years later. "
Evaluation of corneal elastic modulus based on Corneal Visualization Scheimpflug Technology.,"Cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings caused by trauma seriously influences visual function and causes blepharon deformities. The treatment of cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings is intractable. A 45-year-old male presented severe cicatricial conjunctival constriction ring due to traffic accident injury. This 5-mm diameter constriction ring resulted in the patient's eyelid deformities, including eyelid ptosis, ectropion, and visual obstruction. The patient underwent primary surgery of serial conjunctival Z-plasty for correction of the constriction ring. Conjunctival constriction ring was corrected immediately after Z-plasy. Fornix deepening suturing was adopted to promote formation of fornix and correct eyelid ectropion. A secondary surgery of frontalis flap suspension was adopted to correct ptosis 6 months after Z-plasty. The patient achieved a satisfactory and symmetrical appearance with no recurrence of cicatricial conjunctival constriction and no other complications during the 6-month follow-up period. In this patient, the authors claimed that serial Z-plasty surgery can effectively be used for correction of cicatricial conjunctival constriction rings. No further material implantation was applied during the operation. "
Object recognition in acquired and developmental prosopagnosia.,"To evaluate the influence of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine on postoperative quality of recovery following a single bolus dose of rocuronium after pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) under general anesthesia. Prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial. This study was conducted in a University Teaching Hospital from February to July 2017. A total of 84 patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status of I or II who were scheduled to undergo PPV under general anesthesia. The patients were randomly assigned to the neostigmine (Group N, n=44) or sugammadex (Group S, n=40) groups; 3ml of study drug was prepared for the patients. For patients in Group N, a solution of neostigmine methylsulfate (1mg) and glycopyrrolate (0.2mg) was prepared, while a solution of sugammadex sodium (2mg/kg) and normal saline was prepared for patients in Group S. The primary endpoint was the effect of sugammadex, compared with neostigmine, on the recovery rate in the physiological domain in patients who underwent PPV with general anesthesia. The quality of recovery was assessed using the Postoperative Quality Recovery Scale at 15min and 40min after surgery, and on postoperative day 1. The recovery rate in the physiological domain was higher in Group S at 15min after surgery (P=0.020). Though there were no significant differences in the overall cognitive recovery domain, patients in Group S could recall more numbers in reverse order. However, there were no significant differences between the groups in the other domains of the scale. The use of sugammadex may increase the quality of physiological recovery at early postoperative periods, compared with that of neostigmine, following a single bolus dose of rocuronium in patients undergoing PPV with general anesthesia.

Evaluation of acute corneal damage induced by 222-nm and 254-nm ultraviolet light in Sprague-Dawley rats.,"Inflammasomes play an important role in neuroinflammation. However, their function during the secondary death of retinal cells after traumatic optic neuropathy and their dependence on pathogen stimuli remains unclear. Therefore, we evaluated the expression profiles of 10 different inflammasome-related mRNAs in the retina following an optic nerve crush (OPC) injury under both conventional sterile as well as non-sterile conditions, and validated two significantly varied ones on a protein level. While most factors were much more highly elevated in non-sterile conditions, both Nlrp1b and Nlrp3 inflammasome mRNAs were increased significantly on postoperative day 1 to day 7 in the mouse sterile OPC injury model. While production of the inflammation-associated cytokines IL-1 and IL-18 could be continuously detected on an mRNA level postoperatively, a clear peak could be seen on day 7 that coincided with maximal expression of caspase-1 mRNA and with observation of retinal ganglion cells death, despite the mice being held in specific-pathogen free conditions. As such, the pro-inflammatory cytokines activated by inflammasome activation during OPC injury may drive secondary cell death through pyroptosis, and inhibition of these delayed responses may be an important means of preventing worsened injury and loss of vision in trauma patients.

Topical Tacrolimus for Chronic Allergic Conjunctival Disease with and without Atopic Dermatitis.,"Patients with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) exhibit decreased retinal blood flow and vessel density (VD). However, it is not known whether these changes are also present in individuals with early AD (eAD) or amnestic type mild cognitive impairment (aMCI), an enriched pre-AD population with a higher risk for progressing to dementia. We performed a prospective case-control clinical study to investigate whether optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) parameters in the macula and disc are altered in those with aMCI and eAD. This is a single center study of 32 participants. Individuals with aMCI/eAD (n = 16) were 1:1 matched to cognitively normal controls (n = 16). We evaluated OCTA images of the parafoveal superficial capillary plexus (SCP) and two vascular layers in the peripapillary region, the radial peripapillary capillary (RPC) and superficial vascular complex (SVC). Outcome vascular and structural parameters included VD, vessel length density (VLD), adjusted flow index (AFI) and structural retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness. We compared these parameters between the two groups and examined the correlation between OCTA parameters and cognitive performance on the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA). Cognitively impaired participants demonstrated statistically significant decrease in parafoveal SCP VD and AFI as compared to controls, but no statistically significant difference in peripapillary parameters. Furthermore, we found a significant positive correlation between MoCA scores for the entire study cohort and both the parafoveal SCP VD and peripapillary RPC VLD. OCTA shows significant decline in parafoveal flow and VD in individuals with early cognitive impairment related to AD, suggesting that these parameters could have potential utility as early disease biomarkers. In contrast, the presence of larger vascular channels in the peripapillary region may have obscured subtle capillary changes in that region. Overall, the correlation between vascular OCTA parameters and cognitive performance supports further OCTA studies in this population. "
Major factors affecting intraocular pressure spike after intravitreal ranibizumab injection: Vitreous reflux and its amount.,"To examine the foveal structure and vasculature in eyes with an idiopathic epiretinal membrane (ERM). Forty-nine eyes of 48 patients with an idiopathic ERM were studied. The superficial foveal avascular zone (FAZ) was measured by optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA; RTVue XR Avanti, Optovue Inc., Fremont, CA), and the central foveal thickness (CFT) was measured by swept source OCT (DRI-OCT, Topcon, Japan). Twenty eyes underwent vitrectomy with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling, and the FAZ and CFT were evaluated pre- and postoperatively. Forty-nine eyes of 49 age-matched healthy subjects were also examined as control. The FAZ in eyes with an ERM was significantly smaller than that of the control eyes (0.1880.16 mm2 vs 0.3280.14 mm2, P<0.01). The CFT in eyes with an ERM was significantly thicker than that of control eyes (3150.14 m vs 1930.14 m, P<0.01). The size of the FAZ was strongly correlated with the CFT (ERM, R = -0.753; control, R = -0.61, both P<0.01). The postoperative size of the FAZ was not significantly different from the preoperative size (0.115 mm2 vs 0.128 mm2, P = 0.17) but the CFT was significantly thinner (370 m vs 288 m, P<0.01) after the vitrectomy with ILM peeling in 20 eyes. The results indicate that an ERM might affect the morphology and vasculature of not only the inner but also the outer retina before and after vitrectomy with ILM peeling. The FAZ area might have been affected by the ILM peeling. "
Isolated cilioretinal artery occlusion secondary to perinuclear antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody vasculitis.,"To analyze the frequency and phenotypic variation of AMD in subjects with high myopia (HM), and to describe the clinical course and response to treatment of neovascularization (NV). Patients with HM were identified at five retina tertiary referral centers. Inclusion criteria were myopic patients aged 55 years or more with axial lengths equal or greater than 25.5 mm. A total of 874 eyes from 442 HM subjects older than 55 years were identified and 104 eyes of 54 patients (72  11 years) were included in the study and followed up for 23.5  19.5 months. The estimated AMD frequency in HM subjects over 55 years was 11.9% (95% confidence interval; 9.8%-14.0%). A total of 34 of 104 eyes were diagnosed with drusen, 22 with reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), 28 with both drusen and RPD, and 20 with geographic atrophy. Neovascularization was detected in 52 eyes (50%), and type 1 was the most frequent form (39 eyes, 75%). Overall, NV was treated with 4.6  2.6 anti-VEGF injections. Eyes with treatment-nave NV at baseline (n = 34) required 3.8  1.5 anti-VEGF injections during the first year of treatment. This exceeded the injection number in the purely myopic population (1.8 to 3.6 injections for the first year). This study provides evidence to suggest that older patients with HM are at a significant risk of the dry and neovascular forms of AMD. NV in eyes with HM and AMD required more injections in the first year compared to NV in HM eyes without AMD. "
Severe toxic keratopathy after topical natamycin and ceftazidime use in an infant.,"Eye movement abnormalities are common in multiple sclerosis (MS), and infrared oculography is a noninvasive method for quantification. This study aims to describe and classify abnormalities of visual fixation and their clinical relevance in MS. A validated standardized infrared oculography protocol, Demonstrate Eye Movement Networks with Saccades, was used for quantifying gaze stability during a fixation task in MS patients and healthy controls. Saccadic intrusions, gaze drift, and stability of fixation around the drift line were used to subclassify MS patients by performing receiver operating characteristic analyses of different parameters. The relationship between the presence of abnormalities of fixation and visual functioning was analyzed using logistic regression models, which was adjusted for possible confounders. This cross-sectional study included 213 subjects with MS and 57 healthy controls. Square wave jerk abnormalities were present in 24% of MS patients. The prevalence was higher in more disabled subjects. The presence of larger square wave jerks (with a higher amplitude) in the MS patients was related to complaints of focusing on stationary objects (odds ratio, 2.2; P = 0.035) and a lower vision-related quality of life (odds ratio, 2.56; P = 0.012). This study provided a comprehensive overview of the characteristics of problems with visual fixation in subjects with MS. The most important and most common finding was the presence of larger square wave jerks during fixation, which was related to visual functioning in daily life. "
Small Hard Macular Drusen and Associations in 11- to 12-Year-Old Children in the Copenhagen Child Cohort 2000 Eye Study.,"Problematic use of video games, social media, and Internet-related activities may be associated with sleep deprivation and poor work performance. The Internet Addiction Test was given to military medical and nursing students and housestaff to assess problematic Internet use. Medical and nursing students at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences and residents from Naval Medical Center San Diego were contacted via email (n = 1,000) and given a survey that included the Internet Addiction Test (IAT) and questions asking about other specific lifestyle variables. Individuals who received an Internet Addiction Score (IAS) 50 were identified as likely experiencing harmful effects of Internet addiction (IA). Of 399 surveys submitted, 68 were omitted due to gross incompletion or failing to finish the entirety of the IAT. Of the participants included, 205 (61.1%) were male and 125 (37.9%) were female. The mean age was 28.6 years old (S.D. = 5.1 years). In regards to training status, completed surveys were assessed for 94 medical residents, 221 School of Medicine students, and 16 Graduate School of Nursing students. Our survey showed 5.5% of the participants (n = 18) indicated problems with Internet use that are concerning for IA. The study results indicated that our population showed problematic Internet use in the lower range of global estimates of IA. Rates of IA further decreased between medical students and residents. Multiple lifestyle variables were significantly associated with IA score and may serve as indicators of a higher score. Interestingly, the use of social media during sleeping hours was most significantly associated with increased IAS. This paper discusses IA among military medical and nursing trainees and how problematic Internet use may affect work performance and force readiness. "
A Mixture of U.S. Food and Drug Administration-Approved Monoaminergic Drugs Protects the Retina From Light Damage in Diverse Models of Night Blindness.,"Epilepsy is one of the most common chronic disorders of the brain affecting around 70 million people worldwide. Treatment is mainly symptomatic, and most patients achieve long-term seizure control. Up to one-third of the affected subjects, however, are resistant to anticonvulsant therapy. Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) and Dravet syndrome (DS) are severe, refractory epilepsy syndromes with onset in early childhood. Currently available interventions fail to control seizures in most cases, and there remains the need to identify new treatments. Cannabidiol (CBD) is the first in a new class of antiepileptic drugs. It is a major chemical of the cannabis plant, which has antiseizure properties in absence of psychoactive effects.

PH20 Inhibits TGF1-Induced Differentiation of Perimysial Orbital Fibroblasts via Hyaluronan-CD44 Pathway in Thyroid-Associated Ophthalmopathy.,"Subretinal fibrosis has been recognized as a feature of an advanced stage of exudative age-related macular degeneration (AMD) that leads to irreversible loss of vision. This study was aimed at elucidating roles of interlukin-6 (IL-6) in the development of subretinal fibrosis. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed with anti-human IL-6 antibody in surgically excised choroidal neovascular tissues from patients with exudative AMD. The area of subretinal fibrosis was measured in a mouse subretinal fibrosis model with injection of control small interfering RNA(siRNA) or IL-6 siRNA, or isotype control antibody or anti-IL-6 receptor antibody after peritoneal exudative cells (PECs) injection into the vitreous cavity. PECs derived from IL-6<sup>+/+</sup> or IL-6<sup>--</sup> mice were placed into the subretinal space of IL-6<sup>+/+</sup> mice. IL-6 was expressed in the stroma and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) layer in the choroidal neovascular tissues. IL-6 knockdown or blocking of the IL-6 receptor suppressed the formation of subretinal fibroblastic scars. The area of subretinal fibrosis induced by PECs derived from IL-6<sup>--</sup> mice was less than that induced by PECs from IL-6<sup>+/+</sup> mice. The results suggested that IL-6, expressed by activated macrophages, is a crucial mediator that promotes subretinal fibrosis. Targeting IL-6 and the corresponding signaling pathway would be an attractive therapeutic approach not only in choroidal neovascularization, but also in subretinal fibrosis. "
Premacular Cell Proliferation Profiles in Tangential Traction Vitreo-Maculopathies Suggest a Key Role for Hyalocytes.,"To describe our clinical experience with the efficacy and safety of micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation as a treatment for glaucoma. In this retrospective case series, we reviewed the charts of 95 consecutive patients with various glaucoma subtypes who underwent micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation. Patients were offered micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation if they had perimetric glaucoma refractory to intraocular pressure-lowering topical medications and who were poor candidates for traditional filtering surgery. Eligible patients were treated with the Micropulse P3 device (IQ 810 Laser Systems; Iridex, Mountain View, CA, USA) at 2.0-2.5W for a duration of 90s per hemisphere at a 31.3% duty cycle. If a retreatment was needed, the power was increased to up to 3.0W with other parameters remaining the same. Patients were considered successfully treated if their intraocular pressure was lowered by at least 20% compared to their baseline. The main outcome measure was post-operative intraocular pressure; secondary outcome measures included the number of adverse events and complications that occurred with treatment. The glaucoma subtypes treated included primary open-angle glaucoma (n=51), exfoliation glaucoma (n=24), chronic angle-closure glaucoma (n=15), and congenital/juvenile glaucoma (n=5). The mean pre-operative intraocular pressure was 25.15.3mmHg and the mean post-operative intraocular pressure at 12months was 17.55.1mmHg (p=0.004). The mean number of intraocular pressure-lowering medications used preoperatively was 3.01.1; the mean number of medications used at the 12-month post-operative visit was 1.41.0 (p=0.03). Success with one treatment was achieved in 73 (76.8%) of patients. With multiple treatments, all patients had significant intraocular pressure-lowering compared to baseline. The maximum number of treatments received by any single patient was 5. There were no instances of prolonged intraocular inflammation or long-term hypotony. Micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation appears to be a safe and efficacious treatment for glaucoma. Given its improved safety profile compared to continuous-wave transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, it deserves consideration as a primary procedure. "
Protective effect of glycine in streptozotocin-induced diabetic cataract through aldose reductase inhibitory activity.,"Suprachoroidal hemorrhage is an unexpected complication after penetrating keratoplasty during childhood. We report the case of delayed suprachoroidal hemorrhage after penetrating keratoplasty in a neonate as the first manifestation of hemophilia. A 4-day-old neonate was referred to our hospital because of bilateral corneal opacities present since birth. A diagnosis of bilateral Peter's anomaly type 2 with right eye corneal perforation was made after examination. Appropriate treatment was commenced, and later, right eye therapeutic penetrating keratoplasty combined with lensectomy, and anterior vitrectomy was performed. This was complicated postoperatively with suprachoroidal hemorrhage and retinal detachment. Conservative management was advised due to poor visual prognosis. Threemonths later, the patient was found to have high intraocular pressure in the left eye and glaucoma surgery was recommended. Proper hematological investigations before glaucoma surgery in the left eye revealed a low level of factor VIII with normal levels of factor IX and von Willebrand's factor antigen. Therefore, a diagnosis of hemophilia type A was established. This case serves as a reminder that the occurrence of suprachoroidal hemorrhage, especially in the absence of other predisposing risk factors, should warrant detailed systemic assessment to exclude underlying bleeding disorders.

Oral guaifenesin for treatment of filamentary keratitis: A pilot study.,"We showed previously that 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylamino-propyl)-carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC) crosslinked recombinant human collagen III (RHCIII) hydrogels promoted stable regeneration of the human cornea (continued nerve and stromal cell repopulation) for over four years. However, as EDC crosslinking kinetics were difficult to control we additionally tested a sterically bulky carbodiimide. Here, we compared the effects of two carbodiimide crosslinkers - bulky, aromatic CMC, and non-bulky EDC - in a mouse corneal graft model. Murine corneas undergoing full-thickness implantation with these gels became opaque due to dense retro-corneal membranes (RCM). Corneal epithelial cytokeratin 12 and alpha smooth muscle actin indicative of functional tissue regeneration and wound contraction were observed in RCM surrounding both hydrogel types. However, quantitatively different levels of infiltrating CD11c<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DC) were found, suggesting a hydrogel-specific innate immune response. More DC infiltrated the stroma surrounding EDC-NHS hydrogels concurrently with higher fibrosis-associated tenascin c expression. The opposite was true for CMC-NHS gels which had previously been shown to be more tolerising to DC. In vitro studies showed that DC cultured with transforming growth factor 1 (TGF 1) induced fibroblasts to secrete more tenascin c than those cultured with lipopolysaccharide and this effect was blocked by TGF 1 neutralisation. Furthermore, tenascin c staining was found in 40-50 m long membrane nano-tubes formed in fibroblast/DC co-cultures. We suggest that TGF 1 alternatively activated (tolerising) DC regulate fibroblast-mediated tenascin c secretion, possibly via local production of TGF 1 in early wound contraction, and that this is indirectly modulated by different hydrogel chemistries.

The Port Delivery System with Ranibizumab for Neovascular Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Results from the Randomized Phase 2 Ladder Clinical Trial.,"Uveitis is a spectrum of inflammatory disorders characterised by ocular inflammation and is one of the leading causes of preventable visual loss. The main aim of the treatment of uveitis is to control the inflammation, prevent recurrences of the disease, and preserve vision while minimizing the adverse effects associated with the therapeutic agents. Initial management of uveitis relies heavily on the use of corticosteroids. However, monotherapy with hi-dose corticosteroids is associated with side effects and cannot be maintained long term. Therefore, steroid-sparing agents are needed to decrease the burden of steroid therapy. Currently, the therapeutic approach for non-infectious uveitis (NIU) consists of a step-ladder strategy with the first line option being corticosteroids in various formulations followed by the use of first, second, and third line agents in cases with suboptimal steroid response. Unfortunately, the agents currently at our disposal have limitations such as having a narrow therapeutic window along with their own individual potential side-effect profiles. Therefore, research has been targeted to identify newer drugs as well as new uses for older drugs that target specific pathways in the inflammatory response. Such efforts are made in order to provide targeted and safer therapy with reduced side effects and greater efficacy. Several specially designed molecular antibodies are currently in various phases of investigations that can potentially halt the inflammation in patients with NIU. In the review, we have provided a comprehensive overview of the current and upcoming therapeutic options for patients with NIU. "
Longitudinal Retinal Perfusion Status in Eyes with Diabetic Macular Edema Receiving Intravitreal Aflibercept or Laser in VISTA study.,"Pericytes (PCs) are specialized cells located abluminal of endothelial cells (ECs) on capillaries, embedded within the same basement membrane. They are essential regulators of vascular development, remodeling, and blood-retina-barrier (BRB) tightness and are therefore important components to maintain tissue homeostasis. The perivascular localization and expression of contractile proteins suggest that PCs participate in capillary blood flow regulation and neurovascular coupling. Due to their ability to differentiate into various cell types in vitro, they are regarded as potential cells for tissue repair and therapeutic approaches in regenerative medicine. Altered function or loss of PCs is associated with a multitude of CNS diseases, including diabetic retinopathy (DR). In this chapter, we will provide a short overview of retinal vascular development, the origin of PCs, and focus on PCs in retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) and in the diabetic retina. Further, animal models to study the fate of PCs and the potential role of (retinal) PCs in regeneration and wound healing will be discussed. "
Preferred practice pattern for central retinal artery occlusion management.,"To compare serum and aqueous humor (AH) vitamin D levels between the patients with diabetic macular edema (DME) and controls. A total of 65 subjects (30 DME, 35 control) were included. One-third of the control group had hypertension, dyslipidemia, or diabetes mellitus without diabetic retinopathy as underlying diseases. Serum and AH levels of 25-hydroxyvitamin D were measured in each subject. Multiple linear regression analysis was performed to investigate factors associated with serum and AH vitamin D levels. There were no significant differences in serum vitamin D levels between the DME (14.39.1ng/mL) and control (16.28.0ng/mL) groups (P=0.374). However, eyes with DME (41.68.0ng/mL) had a higher AH level of vitamin D than control eyes (25.54.1ng/mL, P<0.001). AH vitamin D level was significantly associated with the presence of DME (=0.775, P<0.001). Serum and AH levels of vitamin D were not significantly correlated (r=-0.157, P=0.211). Serum vitamin D levels did not significantly differ between the DME and control groups. Localized vitamin D level in the eye was independent from systemic vitamin D level and it might be another indicator of DME severity. "
Late Ophthalmologic Referral of Anisometropic Amblyopia: A Retrospective Study of Different Amblyopia Subtypes.,"The purpose of the study was to investigate the characteristics of the parafoveal cone density changes in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP) using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (AO-SLO). A total of 14 eyes of RP patients and 10 eyes of control subjects were examined. High-resolution images of cone photoreceptor cells were obtained with a Canon AO-SLO system in the four retinal regions of the superior, inferior, temporal, and nasal areas located 1.0mm from the central fovea. The relationships of cone density with optical coherence tomography (OCT) findings and the visual sensitivity of the static perimetry tests were analyzed in RP patients. The averaged cone densities in RP patients were decreased at 1.0mm eccentricity from the fovea (11,899cells/mm<sup>2</sup>) compared with those in control subjects (16,647cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; P<0.01). The cone density was substantially decreased even in RP patients with an intact interdigitation zone at the examined area (12,865cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; P<0.01 vs. controls) and preserved visual sensitivity with >35dB (13,019cells/mm<sup>2</sup>; P<0.001 vs. controls). In RP, cone photoreceptor cell loss occurred in the parafoveal region with a preserved EZ/IZ or visual sensitivity. AO-SLO may be a useful modality to detect early changes of cone photoreceptor cells in RP patients. "
Complication and prognosis of juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis in the era of modern immunomodulatory treatment.,"Mutations of claudin-19 cause Familial Hypomagnesaemia and Hypercalciuria, Nephrocalcinosis with Ocular Involvement. To study the ocular disease without the complications of the kidney disease, naturally occurring point mutations of human CLDN19 were recreated in human induced pluripotent cells or overexpressed in the retinae of newborn mice. In human induced pluripotent cells, we show that the mutation affects retinal neurogenesis and maturation of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE). In mice, the mutations diminish the P1 wave of the electroretinogram, activate apoptosis in the outer nuclear layer, and alter the morphology of bipolar cells. If mice are given <i>9-cis</i>-retinal to counter the loss of retinal isomerase, the P1 wave is partially restored. The ARPE19 cell line fails to express claudin-19. Exogenous expression of wild type, but not mutant claudin-19, increases the expression of RPE signature genes. Mutated claudin-19 affects multiple stages of RPE and retinal differentiation through its effects on multiple functions of the RPE. "
Influence of Posterior Subcapsular Cataract on Structural OCT and OCT Angiography Vessel Density Measurements in the Peripapillary Retina.,"Synaptic dysfunction and synapse loss are prominent features in Alzheimer's disease. Members of the Rho-family of guanosine triphosphatases, specifically RhoA, and the synaptic protein Arc are implicated in these pathogenic processes. They share a common regulatory molecule, the E3 ligase Ube3A/E6-AP. Here, we show that Ube3A is reduced in an Alzheimer's disease mouse model, Tg2576 mouse, which overexpresses human APP695 carrying the Swedish mutation, and accumulates A in the brain. Depletion of Ube3A precedes the age-dependent behavioral deficits and loss of dendritic spines in these mice, and results from a decrease in solubility following phosphorylation by c-Abl, after A exposure. Loss of Ube3A triggers the accumulation of Arc and Ephexin-5, driving internalization of GluR1, and activation of RhoA, respectively, culminating in pruning of synapses, which is blocked by restoring Ube3A. Taken together, our results place Ube3A as a critical player in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis, and as a potential therapeutic target. "
Philadelphia Telemedicine Glaucoma Detection and Follow-up Study: Intraocular Pressure Measurements Found in a Population at High Risk for Glaucoma.,"Along with the wide investigation activities in developing carbon-based, metal-free catalysts to replace precious metal (e.g., Pt) catalysts for various green energy devices, carbon nanomaterials have also shown great potential for biorelated applications. This article provides a focused, critical review on the recent advances in these emerging research areas.

Association of Vision Loss With Hospital Use and Costs Among Older Adults.,"Objective To investigate which bone age assessment techniques are utilized by radiologists in Pakistan to determine skeletal age in three defined age groups: less than one year, one to three years and three to 18 years. We also assessed the perceived confidence in skeletal age assessments made by respondents using their chosen bone age assessment technique, within each defined age group. Materials and methods A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 147 practicing radiologists in Pakistan. A pre-validated survey form was adopted from a similar study conducted amongst members of theSociety for Pediatric Radiology. The survey collected demographic information, choice of bone age assessment technique in each age group and confidence of bone age assessments in each age group. Results The hand-wrist method of Greulich and Pyle was used by 87.5% of respondents when assessing bone age in infants (less than one year), followed by Gilsanz-Ratibhand bone age method (7.3%). In children aged one to three years, Greulich and Pyle methodwas chosen by 85.7% of respondents, followed by Gilsanz-Ratibhand bone age method (6.1%) and the Hoerr, Pyle, Francis\'Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Foot and Ankle (3.1%). In children, older than three years, the Greulich and Pyle technique was used by 83.7% of respondents. This was followed by Gilsanz-Ratibhand bone age method (5.8%) and the Hoerr, Pyle, Francis\'Radiographic Atlas of Skeletal Development of the Foot and Ankle (3.8%). 26.4% were ""very confident"" in bone age assessments conducted among infants. In children aged one to three years, 38.1% were ""very confident"". In children, greater than three years, 48.6% were ""very confident"" in their chosen technique. Conclusion Greulich and Pyle is the dominant method for bone age assessments in all age groups, however, confidence in its application among infants and young children is low. It is recommended that clear recommendations be developed for bone age assessments in this age group alongside incorporation of indigenous standards of bone age assessments based on a representative sample of healthy native children.

Success in Attaining Independent Funding Among National Institutes of Health K Grant Awardees in Ophthalmology-Reply.,"Chronic ocular pain is poorly understood and difficult to manage. We developed a murine model of corneal surface injury (CSI)-induced chronic ocular neuropathic pain. The study focuses on changes in corneal nerve morphology and associated short- and long-term pain-like behavior after CSI. CSI was induced in mice by local application of an alkali solution (0.75 N NaOH). Corneal nerve architecture, morphology, density, and length were studied. Eye-wiping was evaluated before and after CSI in response to hypertonic saline (2 M NaCl). Naltrexone (NTX) or Naloxone-methiodide (NLX-me), opioid receptor antagonists, were given subcutaneously (s.c., 3 mg/kg) or topically (eye drop, 100 M), and then an eye-wiping test was performed. CSI caused partial corneal deinnervation followed by gradual reinnervation. Regenerated nerves displayed increased tortuosity, beading, and branching. CSI enhanced hypertonic saline-induced eye-wiping behavior compared to baseline or sham-injury (<i>P</i> < 0.01). This hypersensitivity peaked at 10 days and subsided 14 days after CSI. Administration of NTX, or NLX-me, a selective peripheral opioid antagonist, reinstated eye-wiping behavior in the injury group, but not in the sham groups (<i>P</i> < 0.05). This study introduces a model of chronic ocular pain and corneal neuropathy following CSI. CSI induces central and peripheral opioid receptor-dependent latent sensitization (LS) that is unmasked by systemic or topical administration of opioid antagonists. This model of chronic ocular pain establishes LS as a new inhibitory mechanism in the oculotrigeminal system and may be used for potential diagnostic and therapeutic interventions for ocular neuropathy.

Success in Attaining Independent Funding Among National Institutes of Health K Grant Awardees in Ophthalmology.,"The aim of this report is to present a case of cytomegalovirus (CMV) retinitis in an immunocompetent patient using lenalidomide. Case report with fundus photography, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography, and fluorescein angiography imaging. A 55-year-old male with history of multiple myeloma treated with lenalidomide presented with blurriness and floaters in his right eye and was found to have vitreous biopsy-confirmed CMV retinitis. The patient was treated with pars plana vitrectomy, oral valganciclovir, and intravitreal foscarnet. More than one year later, the patient was doing well with visual acuity of 20/25 and no recurrence of retinitis. This represents the second report of CMV retinitis associated with lenalidomide therapy. It suggests that even immunocompetent patients can be affected by CMV retinitis in the context of lenalidomide treatment. It is critical that patients being treated with lenalidomide receive prompt evaluation if they develop ophthalmic symptoms. "
New Data Sets in Population Health Analytics.,"Large randomized clinical trials of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and at high risk for cardiovascular disease revealed that sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors significantly reduced renal events. However, the trials included small numbers of patients with moderate-to-severe chronic kidney disease (CKD). Therefore, the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors remain unknown in T2DM patients complicated with impaired renal function. We examined if SGLT2 inhibitors conferred beneficial effects on kidney function in T2DM patients with CKD. We retrospectively recruited T2DM patients who were newly treated with add-on of SGLT2 inhibitors and suffered from moderate-to-severe renal impairment with CKD stages 3b-4 (15 < estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) < 45 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>), at initiation of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy. We analyzed T2DM patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment who continued to use SGLT2 inhibitors for at least 1 year. We investigated the effects of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy on 1-year changes in eGFR and urinary protein excretion before and after the treatment. We analyzed 42 T2DM patients with median eGFR of 40.4 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>. One-year SGLT2 inhibitor therapy lowered median hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels from 7.6% to 7.5% (not significant). Body weight and blood pressure were significantly decreased, and hemoglobin was significantly increased. The median value of eGFR after 1 year of SGLT2 inhibitor therapy was 41.0 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>, with no significant difference compared with baseline. The annual decline in eGFR improved significantly after SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (eGFR: (median), pre: -3.8, vs. post: 0.1 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup> per year, P < 0.01). We also found a significant decrease in urinary protein excretion after SGLT2 inhibitor therapy (urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio: (median), pre: 0.36, vs. post: 0.23 g/g creatinine, n = 35, P < 0.01). This study revealed the promising observations that add-on treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors exerted significant renoprotective effects, culminating in improvements in annual decline in eGFR and urinary protein excretion in T2DM patients with CKD stages 3b-4, but did not significantly reduce HbA1c. Further prospective clinical trials are warranted to fully elucidate the effects of SGLT2 inhibitors on glycemic control and renal function in T2DM patients with moderate-to-severe renal impairment.

Registered and Published Outcomes of Randomized Clinical Trials in Ophthalmology.,"Pediatric spinal schwannomas/neurofibromas constitute only 2.5%-4% of all pediatric spinal tumors. However, subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) because of spinal pathologies is very rare, representing 1.5% of all cases of SAH. Spinal nerve sheath tumors such as schwannomas rarely present with SAH, especially before the appearance of overt signs of spinal cord or root compression. We report a case of dorsolumbar schwannoma in an 11-year-old girl presenting clinically with signs and symptoms mimicking meningitis, but meningeal signs later proved to be due to SAH associated with spinal (D12-L1) schwannoma and hydrocephalus. Mass was excised and ventriculoperitoneal shunt was inserted. In our clinical practice, we may sometimes come across some uncommon diseases with even more uncommon presentations as happened with us at our institute. We must always consider that there is a possibility of SAH owing to silent spinal lesion in patients with angiographic negative intracranial SAH as in this case. "
Assessment of Consistency Between Peer-Reviewed Publications and Clinical Trial Registries.,"Several studies have previously reported that endothelial cells contributed to pathological fibrosis in proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) through endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndMT); however, the precise mechanism of this interaction has not been completely elucidated. The present study investigated the expression of microRNA (miR)-29a/b cluster in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (HRMECs) and examined its functional role in high glucose (HG)-induced EndMT. HRMECs were exposed to glucose at concentrations of 5, 15, 30 and 50 mM for 7 days and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, western blotting and immunofluorescence were conducted to determine the expression of genes associated with miR-29a/b and EndMT. A luciferase reporter gene assay was also performed to confirm the association between miR-29a/b and neurogenic locus notch homolog protein 2 (Notch2). The expression levels of miR-29a/b, and endothelial markers vascular endothelial cadherin and cluster of differentiation 31 were decreased, whereas the expression levels of Notch2 and mesenchymal markers, including -smooth muscle actin, fibroblast-specific protein 1 (also named S100 calcium binding protein A4, S100A4), fibronectin and SNAI1 were increased in HRMECs under HG (30 nM) conditions. In addition, Notch2 was identified as a target of miR-29a and miR-29b. Overexpression of miR-29a/b downregulated the expression of Notch2 and subsequently suppressed HG-induced EndMT. Taken together, the results of the present study revealed that the miR-29/Notch2 signaling pathway may participate in the regulation of HG-induced EndMT, and may serve as a potential molecular target during fibrosis in PDR. "
Current screening practice in patients under long-term hydroxychloroquine medication in Taiwan: A nationwide population-based cohort study.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a chronic and progressive complication of diabetes mellitus. DR impairs sight due to neuronal and vascular dysfunction in the retina. It is critical to investigate the pathogenesis of DR to develop effective treatment. In the present study, a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rat model was constructed and the expression of microRNA (miR)-204-5p and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) were determined. Immunohistochemistry, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and western blotting were employed to detect the effects of miR-204-5p on the expression of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3B). RT-qPCR analysis demonstrated that miR-204-5p and VEGF were significantly upregulated in the retina tissue of diabetic rats compared with the control group (P<0.01). Immunohistochemistry and western blotting revealed that the protein expression levels of LC3B-II and the ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I were significantly suppressed in the diabetes group compared with the control (P<0.01). In retinal tissues, anti-miR-204-5p treatment significantly enhanced the protein expression levels of LC3B-II and the ratio of LC3B-II/LC3B-I and these levels were significantly reduced in response to miR-204-5p mimic treatment compared with the negative miR control (P<0.01). In rat retinal endothelial cells isolated from diabetic rats, anti-miR-204-5p treatment increased the number of autophagic vacuoles, and significantly promoted LC3B-II expression and the LC3B-II/LC3B-I ratio compared with the negative control (P<0.01). The results of the present study revealed that miR-204-5p downregulated the expression of LC3B-II to inhibit autophagy in DR. Therefore, miR-204-5p may be considered as a novel effective therapeutic target during the development of DR. "
Identification of aberrantly methylated differentially expressed genes in age-related macular degeneration.,"The present study describes a surgical technique for the management of complex dislocation and subluxation of the intraocular lens (IOL)-capsular bag (CB)-capsular tension ring (CTR) complex. During the procedure, one double-curved suture was inserted through the sclera into the posterior chamber, passing through the anterior capsules and then into the anterior chamber. The suture lines were pulled out from above and below the IOL-CB-CTR complex and a knot was tied 1 mm away from the corneoscleral incision. The IOL-CB-CTR complex was repositioned by adjusting the suture length. This novel method does not require explanting of the original IOL, allowing the IOL-CB-CTR complex to be immobilized in a simple and effective way. "
Efficacy of fenofibrate for diabetic retinopathy: A systematic review protocol.,"Emotional intelligence refers to how individuals deal with intrapersonal or interpersonal emotional information and how a subject identifies, expresses, understands, regulates, and uses his/her own emotions or those of others. The purpose of the present study was to validate the Arabic version of the ""Profile of Emotional Competence"" (PEC) questionnaire. A sample of 285 Tunisian participants (153 men and 132 women) was recruited, age range: 12-18 years (15.22.4 years). The participants were prospectively classified into the following two groups: athletes (n=101) and nonathletes (n=184). Findings of the present study indicated that the Arabic version of the PEC questionnaire has good psychometric properties. The Cronbach's <i>a</i> suggested that all subscales had adequate internal consistency. Test-retest reliability was excellent. The correlations between interpersonal and intrapersonal subscales were low to moderate (from 0.37 to 0.59), except for the regulation interpersonal, utilization interpersonal, and utilization intrapersonal subscales, which showed negligible correlations with the other subscales. The two-factor solution (interpersonal and intrapersonal competence models) accounted for 62.1% of variance. All subscales loaded on the expected factor, except for the utilization intrapersonal and regulation interpersonal subscales, which did not yield a satisfactory loading. Age and athletes' status impacted on all the PEC dimensions, except for some subscales. Finally, psychologists and practitioners in the Arab world could use the PEC questionnaire as a valid and reliable instrument for planning ad hoc interventions. "
Response: Effects of Sex Hormones on Ocular Blood Flow and Intraocular Pressure in Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma: The Effect of Orgasm and Sexual Activity.,"To evaluate the success rate and long-term motor and sensory outcomes of the full tendon vertical rectus transposition (VRT) with Foster suture for unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy. We reviewed the medical records of patients with unilateral acquired sixth cranial nerve palsy who underwent unilateral full tendon VRT with Foster suture between 2005 and 2016 and had a follow-up of 2 years. Data on pre- and postoperative diplopia, face turn, ocular deviation, and limitation of abduction were collected. A successful outcome was defined as a horizontal deviation 10 prism diopter (PD) of ortho in a primary position at distance and absence of diplopia. A total of 20 patients were included in this study. Median (IQR) preoperative deviation was esotropia 65 (40-130) PD, which improved to 10 (-4 to 45) PD postoperatively. Median (IQR) improvement of esotropia was 54 (30-76) PD (<i>P</i><0.001). Median (IQR) preoperative limitation of abduction was -15 (-22.5 to 10; negative value means before reaching midline), which improved to 15 (7.5-45) pass midline postoperatively. Median (IQR) improvement of abduction deficit was 26 (15-35) (<i>P</i><0.001). Successful surgical outcomes were obtained in eleven patients (55%). All patients in the non-successful group (n=9, 45%) had residual esotropia. Two of them underwent additional bilateral medial rectus recession. No postoperative vertical deviation or torsional diplopia was observed. In our series, the full tendon VRT with Foster suture in unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy resulted in significant improvement of the ocular alignment and range of abduction over the 2-year follow-up period.

Macular ganglion cell-inner plexiform vs retinal nerve fiber layer measurement to detect early glaucoma with superior or inferior hemifield defects.,"The head-mounted automated perimeter imo<sup></sup> is a new portable perimeter that does not require a dark room and can be used to examine patients in any setting. In this study, imo 24plus (1-2) AIZE examinations were compared with previous Humphrey Field Analyzer (HFA) 30-2 (SITA standard) examinations within the same patient. imo examinations (either head-mounted [i-H] or fixed [i-F] type) were performed in patients with glaucoma or suspected glaucoma who had already experienced HFA five or more times. Measurement time and correlations of mean deviation (MD) and visual field index (VFI) values were compared between groups for HFA, i-H, i-F, and imo total (i-T). Fixation loss (FL), false-positive (FP), and false-negative (FN) detection rates were compared. The percentage of binocular random single-eye tests under possible non-occlusion conditions using imo was determined. Mann-Whitney <i>U</i> test was performed, and Spearman's rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated. The inclusion period was July to December 2016. Among 273 subjects (543 eyes), 147 (292 eyes) were tested with i-H type and 126 (251 eyes) with i-F type. Mean MD values for HFA and i-T were -6.17.8 and -6.27.1 dB, respectively. Mean measurement times for HFA, i-H, i-F, and i-T were 15.232.07, 10.472.11, 11.042.31, and 10.542.19 minutes, respectively (<i>P</i><0.01 for HFA vs i-H/i-F). Total mean measurement time was shorter by 30.8% for i-T vs HFA. Correlation coefficients of MD and VFI were <i>R</i><sup>2</sup>>0.81 for HFA vs i-H and i-F. FP and FN detection rates were significantly higher with i-T than HFA; there was no significant difference in FL. Binocular random single-eye tests were possible in 85% of cases. imo reduced measurement time by 30.8%. imo VFI and MD values were highly correlated with HFA. As i-F and i-H types produced similar results, imo can be used in accordance with the patient's situation. "
Establishment of vestibular function multimodality platform.,"To assess the utility and safety of implanting two second-generation trabecular micro-bypass stents following cataract surgery in eyes with mild to advanced glaucoma or ocular hypertension (OHT). Retrospective study of iStent<sup></sup>inject trabecular micro-bypass implantation with cataract surgery by five surgeons at five sites in Australia. Eyes had mild to advanced glaucoma (predominantly primary open-angle, appositional angle-closure, or pseudoexfoliative glaucoma) or OHT and cataract requiring surgery. Effectiveness measures included intraocular pressure (IOP); medication burden; and proportions of eyes with no medications, 2 medications, stable or decreased medications vs preoperative, and IOP 18 mmHg. Safety measures included visual acuity, cup-to-disc ratio (CDR), visual field (VF), complications, adverse events, and secondary surgical interventions. Patients have been followed for 12 months, and follow-up is ongoing. Of the 290 total eyes that underwent surgery, 165 eyes had 12-month outcomes at the time of data collection and are included in this report. In these eyes, mean Month 12 IOP reduced by 23.2% from 18.275.41 mmHg preoperatively to 14.042.98 mmHg (<i>P</i><0.001), with 95.8% of eyes achieving Month 12 IOP of 18 mmHg vs 60.6% preoperatively. Mean number of medications at 12 months decreased by 71.5%, 0.470.95 vs 1.651.28 preoperatively; 76.4% of eyes were on zero medications vs 17.6% preoperatively (<i>P</i><0.001); 14.5% of eyes were on 2 medications vs 46.7% preoperatively (<i>P</i><0.001); and 98.2% of eyes maintained or reduced medications vs their preoperative regimen. Favorable safety included no stent-related intraoperative complications; limited and transient postoperative adverse events; and stable CDR, VF, and visual acuity. Three eyes with more advanced disease underwent additional glaucoma surgeries. iStent inject implantation with cataract surgery significantly and safely reduced medications and IOP in eyes with various types and severities of glaucoma within a multicenter, multi-provider, real-life setting.

"Endometriosis of the Eyelid, an Extraordinary Extra-abdominal Location Highlighting the Spectrum of Disease.","Penetrating ocular trauma is one of the most important causes of vision loss, especially in men, and can be associated with intraocular foreign bodies. The incidence of intraocular cilia after trauma is very low. Here we report the case of a 24-year-old man who visited Poostchi Ophthalmology Clinic (Shiraz, Iran) due to a gradual vision loss in his left eye over the past 2 months. The probable cause was a foreign object (metal splinter) in the eye as a result of hammering metal on metal. An examination revealed the site of a 2-mm sealed corneal laceration, localized central cataract with intralenticular cilia, and moderate anterior reaction. The patient underwent foreign body removal, lensectomy, and posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation. One day after the operation, the visual acuity of the patient was 20/20. The intraocular cilia may have various clinical presentations; however, there is no report of a case with cilium embedded in the lens without any sight-threatening complications other than localized cataract and a moderate inflammatory reaction. Timely management and operation allow such patients to maintain a good vision. "
Colour vision in juvenile myoclonic epilepsy.,"Despite expanding knowledge regarding the role of astroglia in regulating neuronal function, little is known about regional or functional subgroups of brain astroglia and how they may interact with neurons. We use an astroglia-specific promoter fragment in transgenic mice to identify an anatomically defined subset of adult gray matter astroglia. Using transcriptomic and histological analyses, we generate a combinatorial profile for the in vivo identification and characterization of this astroglia subpopulation. These astroglia are enriched in mouse cortical layer V; express distinct molecular markers, including Norrin and leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptor 6 (LGR6), with corresponding layer-specific neuronal ligands; are found in the human cortex; and modulate neuronal activity. Astrocytic Norrin appears to regulate dendrites and spines; its loss, as occurring in Norrie disease, contributes to cortical dendritic spine loss. These studies provide evidence that human and rodent astroglia subtypes are regionally and functionally distinct, can regulate local neuronal dendrite and synaptic spine development, and contribute to disease.

Comments to: Valsalva retinopathy associated with intranasal cocaine abuse: A case report.,"During mouse postnatal eye development, the embryonic hyaloid vascular network regresses from the vitreous as an adaption for high-acuity vision. This process occurs with precisely controlled timing. Here, we show that opsin 5 (OPN5; also known as neuropsin)-dependent retinal light responses regulate vascular development in the postnatal eye. In Opn5-null mice, hyaloid vessels regress precociously. We demonstrate that 380-nm light stimulation via OPN5 and VGAT (the vesicular GABA/glycine transporter) in retinal ganglion cells enhances the activity of inner retinal DAT (also known as SLC6A3; a dopamine reuptake transporter) and thus suppresses vitreal dopamine. In turn, dopamine acts directly on hyaloid vascular endothelial cells to suppress the activity of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) and promote hyaloid vessel regression. With OPN5 loss of function, the vitreous dopamine level is elevated and results in premature hyaloid regression. These investigations identify violet light as a developmental timing cue that, via an OPN5-dopamine pathway, regulates optic axis clearance in preparation for visual function. "
[Regularities of clinical application of hand acupuncture therapy to treatment of various diseases based on data mining].,"De novo DDX3X variants account for 1-3% of syndromic intellectual disability (ID) in females and have been occasionally reported in males. Furthermore, somatic DDX3X variants occur in several aggressive cancers, including medulloblastoma. We report three unrelated females with severe ID, dysmorphic features, and a common brain malformative pattern characterized by malformations of cortical development, callosal dysgenesis, basal ganglia anomalies, and midbrain-hindbrain malformations. A pilocytic astrocytoma was incidentally diagnosed in Patient 1 and trigonocephaly was found in Patient 2. With the use of family based whole exome sequencing (WES), we identified three distinct de novo variants in DDX3X. These findings expand the phenotypic spectrum of DDX3X-related disorders, demonstrating unique neuroradiological features resembling those of the tubulinopathies, and support a role for DDX3X in neuronal development. Our observations further suggest a possible link between germline DDX3X variants and cancer development. "
Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography and Glaucoma: A Brief Review.,"A 48-year-old woman presented with bilateral non-pulsatile proptosis and ophthalmoplegia after 3days following blunt orbital trauma. It was associated with fever, malaise and loss of vision in right eye. She was provisionally diagnosed with cavernous sinus thrombosis and was treated with intravenous antibiotics with no improvement. A subtle bruit was present on examination, and digital subtraction angiography revealed a right direct (type A) carotid-cavernous fistula (CCF). The patient underwent right coil embolisation of direct CCF. On follow-up at 4months, her proptosis resolved completely and extraocular movements improved. "
"Whole exome sequencing identified ARL2 as a novel candidate gene for MRCS (microcornea, rod-cone dystrophy, cataract, and posterior staphyloma) syndrome.","Systemic hyperuricemia (HyUA) in obesity/T2DM facilitated by elevated activity of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), which is the sole source of uric acid (UA) in mammals, has been proposed to contribute to the pathogenesis of insulin resistance/dyslipidemia in obesity. Here, the effects of hepatocyte-specific ablation of <i>Xdh</i>, the gene encoding XOR (HXO) and whole-body pharmacologic inhibition of XOR (febuxostat) on obesity-induced insulin resistance/dyslipidemia were assessed. Deletion of hepatocyte <i>Xdh</i> substantially lowered liver and plasma UA concentration. When exposed to an obesogenic diet, HXO and control <i>floxed</i> (FLX) mice became equally obese, but systemic HyUA was absent in HXO mice. Despite this, obese HXO mice became as insulin resistant and dyslipidemic as obese FLX mice. Similarly, febuxostat dramatically lowered plasma and tissue UA and XOR activity in obese wildtype mice without altering obesity-associated insulin resistance/dyslipidemia. These data demonstrate that hepatocyte XOR activity is a critical determinant of systemic UA homeostasis, that deletion of hepatocyte <i>Xdh</i> is sufficient to prevent systemic HyUA of obesity, and that neither prevention nor correction of HyUA improves insulin resistance/dyslipidemia in obesity. Thus, systemic HyUA, while clearly a biomarker of the metabolic abnormalities of obesity, does not appear to be causative. "
Brucellosis Complicated by Kikuchi-Fujimoto Disease and Doxycycline-Induced Intracranial Hypertension.,"Retinoblastoma (RB) is a primary intraocular malignancy in childhood, and may develop relapse and metastatic disease. This study was to identify the stem-cell properties of primary retinoblastoma cells critical to tumorigenesis and metastasis. Primary cells were isolated from fresh human RB tissues after enucleation, and cultured in serum-free or serum-enriched conditions, with two RB cell-lines Weri-RB1 and Y79 for comparison. Proliferation of primary RB cells were well-maintained in serum-free condition of DMEM/F12 medium, and formed stem-cell like spheroids. The immaturity of cultured primary RB cells was demonstrated by tendency of highly expressed stem-cell markers (CD133, Nestin and OCT4) and suppressed mature retinal-cell markers (GFAP, MAP2 and Recoverin). CD133, a neural stem-cell marker being exclusively studied in RB, was found positive in small patches of cells in archival human RB by immunohistochemistry. Meanwhile, at initial isolation, insignificant CD133<sup>+</sup> cells were detected by flow-cytometry, and substantial increase of positivity was observed after several days cultivated in serum-free condition. Cultured primary RB cells were engrafted in subretinal region of BALB/c nude mice for assessment of tumorigenicity. Strong tumorigenic activity and extensive progression of the xenograft retinoblastoma was induced by primary cells as compared with the two cell-lines. Again, immunohistochemistry confirmed that the stem-cell markers were emphasized in the xenograft tumor in mice. Our findings demonstrated that in comparison to the well-established RB cell-lines, cultured primary RB cells possess stem-cell like properties with highly expressed stem-cell markers, self-regenerative growth in culture, and strong in vivo oncogenic potentiality.

Interaction between lifestyle and genetic susceptibility in myopia: the Generation R study.,"In recent years, the Wnt/-catenin signaling has gained tremendous attention due to its ability to modulate a number of diseases including diabetic nephropathy. Studies have shown that there is decrease in the secretion of Wnt proteins including Wnt4, 5a and Wnt 6 during high glucose concentration or diabetic conditions, which leads to decreased translocation of -catenin to nucleus. The down-regulation of Wnt/-catenin signaling leads to detrimental effects on kidney including increased apoptosis of mesangial cells and increased deposition of fibrous tissue in mesangium. The pharmacological modulators such as spironolactone, NO donor and antioxidant are shown to produce beneficial effects in diabetic nephropathy by up regulating the expression of Wnt proteins and activation of diabetes-induced suppressed Wnt/-catenin signaling. On the other hand, it is documented that diabetes leads to overactivation of Wnt1/-catenin signaling, which promotes podocyte injury, induce epithelial-mesenchymal transition of podocytes along with renal injury and fibrosis. Accordingly, different interventions aimed to suppress overactivated Wnt/-catenin signaling are reported to improve the condition and symptoms associated with diabetic nephropathy. The present review discusses the dual role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in the pathogenesis of diabetic nephropathy. "
Retinal dystrophies with bull's-eye maculopathy along with negative ERGs.,"We have previously demonstrated that a reduction in ubiquitin (Ub) levels via disruption of the polyubiquitin gene Ubb results in reactive gliosis and hypothalamic neurodegeneration in mice. However, it is not known whether other neural tissues, apart from the brain, can also be affected by Ubb disruption. We examined the retina, which, being derived from the diencephalon, has the same developmental origin as the hypothalamus. We found that expression levels of Ubb were much higher than those of the other polyubiquitin gene Ubc in the retina. In retinal tissues from Ubb knockout (KO) mice, we found that Ubc expression was upregulated to compensate for the loss of Ubb; however, the Ub pool remained disrupted, with reduced levels of free Ub. To directly demonstrate whether the disrupted Ub pools affect neural integrity in retinal tissues, we investigated retinal layers in control and Ubb KO mice. Using optical coherence tomography and histological analysis, we demonstrated that the thickness of the outer nuclear layer of the retina was decreased in Ubb KO mice compared to control mice, suggesting that retinal degeneration was induced by Ub deficiency. Furthermore, the mRNA and protein levels of rhodopsin decreased and those of glial fibrillary acidic protein increased in Ubb KO mouse retinas. Therefore, the maintenance of Ub pools in the retina appears to be crucial for the survival of photoreceptor cells and the prevention of excessive glial cell activation. "
Electrophysiological evaluation of a chronically implanted electrode for suprachoroidal transretinal stimulation in rabbit eyes.,"Intravitreally administered activated protein C in 10 eyes with ischemic central retinal vein occlusion significantly improved macular edema; in 5 eyes, the reperfusion of the retinal nonperfused areas exceeded 50% of baseline.

Outflow facility and extent of angle closure in a porcine model.,"To evaluate the natural history of congenital X-linked retinoschisis (CXLRS) and to assess disease stability or progression over time. Retrospective case series at a single-center, tertiary care, pediatric retina practice. One hundred two eyes of 51 patients with CXLRS. The clinical examinations, fundus photographs, and OCT images of all patients with CXLRS were assessed. Eyes that initially demonstrated combined retinoschisis-retinal detachments and those with large, centrally overhanging schisis cavities were excluded from the analysis (n= 49) because they underwent surgery, which precluded observation of the natural disease course. Stability or conversion of CXLRS phenotype over time. Fifty-three eyes met inclusion criteria for observation of natural disease history over time. At the time of diagnosis, 7.5% of eyes showed type 1 disease (n= 4), 17% showed type 2 disease (n= 9), 66% showed type 3 disease (n= 35), and 9.5% showed type 4 disease (n= 5). Mean length of follow-up was 7.4 years. A total of 7.5% of eyes demonstrated a combined retinoschisis-retinal detachment requiring surgery (n= 4), whereas 1.8% demonstrated a large, centrally overhanging schisis cavity requiring surgery (n= 1). Overall, 83% of eyes (n= 44) remained the same type without conversion or development of a complication requiring surgery. The remaining 17% of eyes (n= 9) experienced some type of change from their baseline diagnosis, with 7.5% (n= 4) converting between phenotypes and 9.5% (n= 5) demonstrating a complication requiring surgery; 3.75% of eyes (n= 2) converted from type 2 to 3 and 7.5% of eyes (n= 4) converted from type 3 to a combined retinoschisis-retinal detachment with mean time to conversion of 4.07 years. This longitudinal study conveyed the natural history of CXLRS. Congenital X-linked retinoschisis displayed long-term stability in 83% of eyes with conversion or progression of the disease to a more severe phenotype in the remaining cases. Type 3 CXLRS was a risk factor for the development of a combined retinoschisis-retinal detachment and may benefit from closer follow-up. "
Ocular surface system alterations in ocular graft-versus-host disease: all the pieces of the complex puzzle.,"To report the efficacy of the use of a new scleral depressor marker during scleral buckling surgery for retinal detachment. Noncomparative, consecutive case series study. Eleven patients (11 eyes) with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment who underwent scleral buckling surgery performed by 2 experienced vitreoretinal surgeons. The prototype of a new indenter marker was used during scleral buckling surgery. The possibility of performing simultaneous indentation and selected marking of the desired area was assessed. Additionally, the precision of the fiber light-assisted indentation as well as force of indentation were evaluated. The use of a new depressor marker facilitated a quick and effective flow of the standard surgery for retinal detachment. It was possible to perform indentation and marking as separate steps of 1 session. Only desired areas of the sclera were marked during the same indentation session. The indentation required less force. When combined with chandelier light, the precision of the marking was improved as demonstrated by a light from the chandelier indicating the highest point of the indentation area. There were no complications related to the use of the new instrument. The newly developed scleral depressor marker facilitated simultaneous indentation and marking on the sclera. The new instrument allowed for the selective marking of the desired areas during the same session of indentation. Additionally, it can be combined with chandelier fiber light, which improves the precision of the marking. "
Microglial activation in an amyotrophic lateral sclerosis-like model caused by Ranbp2 loss and nucleocytoplasmic transport impairment in retinal ganglion neurons.,"To investigate the visual outcomes of patients with traumatic maculopathy and massive subretinal hemorrhage (SRH) after closed-globe injury. Retrospective, noncomparative, and interventional case series. Twenty-four patients with traumatic maculopathy and massive SRH after closed-globe injury. In this retrospective observational case series, we included 25 eyes of 24 patients who had experienced closed-globe injury with massive SRH. The demographics, clinical characteristics, and final visual acuity (VA) of the patients. Twenty-five eyes with massive SRHs involving the macula were studied with initial VAs from light perception to 4/200. At initial presentation, vitreous hemorrhages were present in 22 eyes, hyphema in 13 eyes, lid lacerations in 11 eyes, glaucoma in 8 eyes, iridodialysis in 7 eyes, afferent pupillary defect in 6 eyes, lens dislocation or subluxation in 5 eyes, and cyclodialysis clefts and hypotony in 2 eyes. Retinal detachment developed in 7 eyes during the follow-up period. Pars plana vitrectomy usually was performed in patients with persistent vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment, lens dislocation, and cyclodialysis cleft with hypotony. In final visual outcomes, 7 eyes achieved favorable visual outcomes with VA of 20/200 or more. Thirteen eyes showed VA of 2/200 or less with dense macular scars or foveal atrophy. Foveal atrophy showed encompassed foveal thinning, retinal pigment epithelial clumping, and the loss of external limiting membrane (ELM), ellipsoidal zone (EZ), and interdigital zone (IZ) on spectral-domain OCT. Fundus autofluorescence demonstrated interposed, reduced, and increased autofluorescence in traumatic pigment epitheliopathy. Traumatic maculopathy and massive SRH after closed-globe injury often cause poor visual outcomes, especially in eyes with dense macular scars or foveal atrophy. Spectral-domain OCT findings in patients with good visual outcomes revealed partial to complete preservation of the foveal ELM, EZ, and IZ. "
"Validation of StrabisPIX, a Mobile Application for Home Measurement of Ocular Alignment.","A comparison of anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) medication use across multiple countries. Anti-VEGF medication use is now considered first-line treatment for numerous retinal diseases globally. Exploring medication choices, costs within each healthcare system, policy challenges, emerging treatments, and patient access all provide insight into a newly recognized and major public health issue. All data presented in this review are available through the published English literature in PubMed, non-peer-reviewed trade publications, and reported surveys. The following search terms were used: anti-VEGF OR bevacizumab OR ranibizumab OR aflibercept OR pegaptanib OR conbercept AND trends OR survey OR cost OR patterns OR preference. Countries with large populations and available data included the United States, United Kingdom, China, India, Korea, Singapore, and Australia. Population and economic statistics were obtained from published reports from the World Bank, World Health Organization, and Commonwealth Fund. Anti-VEGF medication use and costs are significant aspects of patient and healthcare system expenditures in each nation and may have an especially large potential economic burden in India and China. Bevacizumab use comprises the majority of anti-VEGF medication use in the United States and Singapore, although aflibercept use is growing rapidly. Paradoxically, data demonstrate that there is a significant trend in medication choice toward ranibizumab and aflibercept among practice settings outside of the United States, such as the United Kingdom, China, South Korea, and Australia. The price of anti-VEGF medications ranged from US $30 (ziv-aflibercept) to US $1950 (ranibizumab and aflibercept). Ranibizumab's price ranged from US $240 in India to US $1950 in the United States. Conbercept in China costs approximately US $1150 per dose. Outside of the United States, many nations are using a majority of more expensive anti-VEGF medications, which may lead to increased costs and decreased access. Increasing the availability of safely compounded anti-VEGF medications will likely improve access, create patient/provider choice, and decrease relative healthcare costs for the growing burden of retinal diseases globally.

Reconstruction of Upper Eyelid Defects Secondary to Malignant Tumors with a Newly Modified Cutler-Beard Technique with Tarsoconjunctival Graft.,"To identify standard clinical parameters that may predict the presence and severity of obstructive sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (OSA). Case series with chart review. Tertiary academic medical center. A total of 325 adult patients (274 men and 51 women; mean age, 44.2 years) with habitual snoring completed comprehensive polysomnography and anthropometric measurements, including modified Mallampati grade (also known as updated Friedman's tongue position [uFTP]), tonsil size grading, uvular length, neck circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference, and body mass index (BMI). When the aforementioned physical parameters were correlated singly with the apnea/hypopnea index (AHI), we found that sex, uFTP, tonsil size grading, neck circumference, waist circumference, hip circumference, thyroid-mental distance, and BMI grade were reliable predictors of OSA. When all important factors were considered in a multiple stepwise regression analysis, an estimated AHI can be formulated by factoring sex, uFTP, tonsil size grading, and BMI grade as follows: -43.0 + 14.1  sex + 12.8  uFTP + 5.0  tonsil size + 8.9  BMI grade. Severity of OSA can be predicted with a receiver operating characteristic curve. Predictors of OSA can be further obtained by the ""OSA score.""This study has distinguished the correlations between sex, uFTP, tonsil size, and BMI grade and the presence and severity of OSA. An OSA score might be beneficial in identifying patients who should have a full sleep evaluation. "
Anterior Segment Biometry with Phenylephrine and Tropicamide during Accommodation Imaged with Ultralong Scan Depth Optical Coherence Tomography.,"To obtain the opinion of patients with rheumatoid arthritis or lupus erythematosus about the use of antimalarials through questionnaires and to evaluate their adherence to medication. A cross-sectional study of patients treated with antimalarial medication for a period equal to or longer than 1year attended between November 2012 and October 2014. A structured questionnaire with 12 questions was filled out. Among 300 patients examined, 92% (275) used medication regularly. Hydroxychloroquine was used by 55% (166) of patients, chloroquine by 25% (75), and 20% (59) reported using both medications at different moments. Most of the patients (221 or 74%) were using medication sevendays a week and had taken it for a period longer than 5years; 61% (182) considered the treatment good and said, 21% (63) said, 'It is good, but I'm afraid of taking it'. Most of the patients (70% or 211) did not report any adverse symptoms. Their main claim was related to blurred vision, which was solved by a refraction examination. Fear has been a factor that makes adherence to treatment difficult. Making patients aware of the importance of the treatment is strongly relevant because antimalarials are well tolerated. "
Photodynamic therapy: A hot topic in dermato-oncology.,"The aim of this study was to investigate the incidence of clinically significant anterior chamber inflammation in a combined surgery, namely, phacoemulsification and Ex-Press miniature glaucoma device implantation, compared to phacoemulsification alone. A retrospective comparative study of a consecutive series of 210 participants above 18years of age diagnosed with significant cataract and who required glaucoma surgery, namely, Ex-Press miniature glaucoma device implantation or cataract alone in one or both eyes. All were operated on by a single experienced glaucoma surgeon in a single medical center. A total of 231 eyes were included in this study. All cases underwent an uneventful surgery and were examined the day following the surgery for visual acuity, intraocular pressure, and signs of excessive anterior chamber inflammation (Standardization of Uveitis Nomenclature grading3). The combined group included 55 eyes of 51 patients, of whom 15 (27.3%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. The phacoemulsification group included 176 eyes of 159 patients, of whom 12 (6.7%) demonstrated excessive anterior chamber inflammation. Visual acuity and intraocular pressure measurements showed no statistically significant difference between the two groups. The Ex-Press glaucoma device is efficient, safe, and known for its inert nature. However, combination of this procedure with phacoemulsification surgery might result in a condition encouraging excessive inflammation, which eventually could lead to excessive anterior chamber inflammations if not treated vigorously. Emphasizing and recognizing the risks, especially in glaucoma patients, is important. "
Do theatre staff use face masks in accordance with the manufacturers' guidelines of use?,"There is a significant variation in the way neovascular age-related macular degeneration patients respond to anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment. Both the financial and time cost of treatment are significant. As such, being able to predict patient response to treatment is valuable. 72 eyes treated with intravitreal aflibercept were retrospectively included in analysis. For each subject, visual acuity (letters) and central retinal thickness (m) at baseline, second, third and fourth visits, as well as 12-month visits, were collated; a plot of visual acuity versus time was generated and a slope of the first three (slope3) and first four (slope4) visits was calculated. Differences in visual acuity at each visit compared to baseline were determined, as well as percentage differences in central retinal thickness at each visit compared to baseline. Lesion sub-type and the presence of fluid and haemorrhage were also recorded. The average change in visual acuity over 12months was +3.213.4 letters with 91.2% of patients losing <15 letters. Slope4 was the only significant predictive factor for 'visual acuity change over 12months' ( p<0.001). Change in central retinal thickness, lesion sub-type, haemorrhage at baseline and the location of fluid at baseline were not useful predictive factors in long-term outcome. Aflibercept is an effective treatment option for neovascular age-related macular degeneration; however, the long-term response should not be predicted until at least three loading dose injections have been given. Visual acuity measures at each visit should be examined, as it is the trend in visual acuity across the first four visits (slope4) rather than the difference in visual acuity between two visits that is the predictive factor. "
Diagnosis and surgical management of orbital sparganosis.,"To investigate the therapeutic efficacy of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- stimulated gene/protein 6 (TSG-6) in a rat model of corneal alkali injury. Corneal alkali injury was produced by placing an NaOH-soaked filter paper disk on the central cornea of the right eye of an anesthetized male Lewis (LEW/Crl) rat. Recombinant human TSG-6, or an equal volume of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), was administered intravenously (IV), by anterior chamber (AC) injection, or as a topical drop. The affected eyes were photographed daily using a dissecting microscope and documented for clinical time course analysis of corneal opacification. Corneal tissue was excised at pre-determined therapeutic endpoints, with subsequent qRT-PCR or histological analyses. The continuous monitoring of corneal alkali injury progression revealed TSG-6 treatments do not show sufficient effectiveness in vivo regardless of IV injection, AC injection, or topical application. Corneal opacification and neovascularization were not diminished, and gene expression was not impacted by these treatments. However, both IV and AC administration of TSG-6 significantly suppressed pro-inflammatory cytokines compared to PBS-treated eyes. We conclude that the therapeutic potential of TSG-6 is insufficient in a rat corneal alkali injury model. "
Direct eyelid defect closure: a prospective study of functional and aesthetic outcomes.,"Environmental variables can regulate behavior in healthy subjects. Recently, some authors investigated the role of meteorological variables in bipolar patients with an impact on both the onset and course of bipolar disorder (BD). The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of meteorological variables and other indexes in bipolar hospitalized patients. We examined all patients admitted to the Psychiatric Inpatient Unit of San Luigi Gonzaga Hospital, Orbassano (Turin, Italy) from September 2013 to August 2015, collecting several socio-demographic and clinical characteristics. Seven hundred and thirty patients were included. Compared to the day of admission of control individuals, patients with BD were admitted on a day that presented higher minimum, medium, and maximum temperature, higher maximum humidity, higher solar radiation, and higher hours of sunshine. After logistic regression analysis, admissions to the emergency psychiatric ward due to a primary diagnosis of BD were associated with maximum temperature and solar radiation. The current study provides a novel perspective on the question surrounding seasonal mood patterns in patients with BD. A greater awareness of all possible precipitating factors is needed to inform self-management and psycho-educational programs as well as to improve resilience regarding affective recurrences in the clinical practice.

Long-term outcomes of bilateral lateral rectus recession versus unilateral lateral rectus recession-medial rectus plication in children with basic type intermittent exotropia.,"We examined the cytoprotective effect of quercetin via activator protein (AP-1) and the heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) pathway against light-induced retinal degeneration in rats. Quercetin was administered intraperitoneally to Sprague-Dawley rats for seven days before light exposure to intense white fluorescent light (3000 lux) for 24 h. Light-induced retinal damage was determined by the number of rows of photoreceptor cell nuclei, the microstructures of the rod outer segments and retinal pigment epithelium, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated 2'-Deoxyuridine-5'-triphosphate (dUTP) nick end labeling. To elucidate the cytoprotective mechanism of quercetin, expression levels were measured in the rat retinas of 8-hydroxy-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a marker of oxidative stress; Hsp70; and transcription factor AP-1 transcription activity. Pretreatment with quercetin inhibited light-induced photoreceptor cellular apoptosis and subsequent retinal degeneration in rats. 8-OHdG and Hsp70 protein expressions were up-regulated markedly by light exposure and suppressed by quercetin pretreatment. The results of an electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that AP-1-binding activity was activated by light exposure, and binding of c-Fos and c-Jun, but not JunB, mediated the binding activity. Intraperitoneal administration of quercetin decreases photooxidative damage in the retina and mediates cytoprotection against light-induced photoreceptor cell degeneration in rats. Suppression of the heterodimeric combination of c-Jun and c-Fos proteins at the AP-1 binding site is highly involved in quercetin-mediated cytoprotection. "
Treatment of presumed trematode-induced granulomatous anterior uveitis among children in rural areas of Egypt.,"Endometrial angiogenesis is a prerequisite for successful pregnancy. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) is a non-invasive physically optical imaging technique widely used in ophthalmology and cardiology. However, there is no study using OCT to evaluate endometrium. The aim of this study was to use OCT and traditionally histological methods to investigate endometrial vascularization in women undergoing in vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (IVF-ET) treatment and to determine the association with the pregnancy outcome. A total of 47 women were included in this study. OCT was used to assess endometrial vascularization by determining the high signal areas precisely on the seventh day after luteinizing hormone surge in non-conception natural cycles. Endometrial biopsies were obtained following OCT and immunohistochemistry was used to determine micro vessel and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A) in the luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium and stroma, separately. Micro vessel counting was performed and the result was expressed as micro vessel density (MVD). A semi-quantitative H-score was used to determine the staining intensity of VEGF-A. In women who successfully conceived after embryo transfer, the proportion of extensive high signal area in the uterine body detected by OCT (80%, 8/10), MVD (median number of micro vessels/mm of 10, range 417) and stromal expression of VEGF-A (median H-score of 189, range 72395) were found to be significantly higher than those of women who did not conceive after embryo transfer in the subsequent IVF-ET treatment (OCT: 30%, 3/10; MVD: median number of micro vessels/mm of 7, range 410; VEGF-A: median H-score of 125, range 86299, respectively). In addition, a significantly higher stromal expression of VEGF-A (median H-score of 196, range 84395) and MVD (median number of micro vessels/mm<sup>2</sup> of 9, range 516) was found in women with extensive high signal area in uterine body, compared to those with focal or no high signal area (stromal VEGF-A: median H-score of 135, range 92302; MVD: number of micro vessels/mm<sup>2</sup> of 6, range 4-11). Both immunohistochemistry and OCT demonstrated significant difference in vascularization of the peri-implantation endometrium between subjects who did and did not conceive after IVF-ET treatment. Our findings also suggest OCT appears to be a promising non-invasive or minimally invasive alternative to study endometrial vascularity in women with reproductive failure. "
Choriocapillaris Flow Impairments in Association with Pachyvessel in Early Stages of Pachychoroid.,"Middle age has been identified as a critical time period for health later in life. Identifying factors associated with worse brain function in middle-aged adults may help identify ways to preserve brain function with aging. Our objective was to evaluate factors associated with a novel measure of brain aging in middle-aged and older adults. Longitudinal cohort study. Beaver Dam Offspring Study (BOSS) baseline (2005-2008), 5-year (2010-2013), and 10-year examinations (2015-2017). A total of 2285 adults, 22 to 84years of age, with complete sensorineural and neurocognitive data at the 5-year examination. Principal component analysis (PCA) was performed combining 5-year sensorineural (hearing, vision, olfaction) and cognitive (Trail Making Test A and B, Digit Symbol Substitution Test, Verbal Fluency Test, Auditory Verbal Learning Test) test data. Participants with a standardized PCA scoreless than -1 were classified as having brain aging. Incident brain aging was defined as a PCA score less than -1 at 10 years among participants who had a PCA scoreof -1 or higher at 5 years. Logistic regression and Poisson models were used to estimate associations between baseline factors and prevalent or incident brain aging, respectively. Older age, being male, current smoking, larger waist circumference, not consuming alcohol, cardiovascular disease, and interleukin-6 were associated with greater odds of prevalent brain aging, whereas more education and exercise were associated with decreased odds. In addition to age and sex, less than a college education, higher levels of soluble intercellular adhesion molecule-1, diabetes, depressive symptoms, and history of head injury were associated with an increased 5-year risk of incident brain aging. In the current study, vascular and inflammatory factors were associated with a new brain aging marker in middle-aged and older adults. Many of these factors are modifiable, highlighting the importance of addressing health and lifestyle factors in midlife to potentially preserve function for better brain health later in life. "
Adiponectin accounts for gender differences in hepatocellular carcinoma incidence.,"To investigate the association between serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) concentrations at visit 2 (1990-1992) and the 18-year incidence of age-related macular degeneration (AMD) between visit 3 (1993-1995) and visit 5 (2011-2013). This prospective analysis was conducted in a subset of participants (n = 1225) from the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study. We evaluated the incidence of any, early, and late AMD from visit 3 to 5. The 25(OH)D concentrations were assessed in 2012-2013 by using stored serum from visit 2. Retinal fundus photographs taken at both visits were graded side by side to determine the incidence of AMD. Logistic regression was used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident AMD outcomes during 18 years of follow-up (1993-1995 to 2011-2013) by tertile of 25(OH)D adjusted for age, race, and smoking status. P for linear trend was estimated by using continuous 25(OH)D concentrations. Sensitivity analyses applied inverse probability weights to account for selection to have eye photographs, death, and loss to follow-up. There was a decreased odds of any incident AMD (n = 139) and large, soft drusen (n = 80) in 25(OH)D tertile 3 versus 1, with OR (95% CI) = 0.57 (0.36-0.90), P trend = 0.11 and with 0.52 (0.28-0.93), P trend = 0.18, respectively. Applying sampling weights attenuated these results to 0.66 (0.38-1.16), P trend = 0.32 (any incident AMD) and 0.54 (0.27-1.09), P trend = 0.36 (large, soft drusen), respectively, suggesting these associations may be biased by loss to follow-up and sampling for retinal photographs at visit 5. No statistically significant results were observed with pigmentary abnormalities (n = 46) or incident late AMD (n = 26). High 25(OH)D concentrations, approximately >70 nM, may be associated with decreased odds of incident early AMD. "
Changes in ocular signs and symptoms in patients switching from bimatoprost-timolol to tafluprost-timolol eye drops: an open-label phase IV study.,"Motion detection is performed by a unique neural network in the mouse retina. Starburst amacrine cells (SACs), which release acetylcholine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) into the network, are key neurons in the motion detection pathway. Although GABA contributions to the network have been extensively studied, the role of acetylcholine is minimally understood. Acetylcholine receptors are present in a subset of bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells. We focused on 7-nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (7-nAChR) expression in bipolar cells, and investigated which types of bipolar cells possess 7-nAChRs. Retinal slice sections were prepared from C57BL/6J and Gus8.4-GFP mice. Specific expression of 7-nAChRs in bipolar cells was examined using -bungarotoxin (BgTx)-conjugated Alexa dyes co-labeled with specific bipolar cell markers. Whole-cell recordings were conducted from bipolar cells in retinal slice sections. A selective 7-nAChR agonist, PNU282987, was applied by a puff and responses were recorded. BgTx fluorescence was observed primarily in bipolar cell somas. We found that 7-nAChRs were expressed by the majority of type 1, 2, 4, and 7 bipolar cells. Whole-cell recordings revealed that type 2 and 7 bipolar cells depolarized by PNU application. In contrast, 7-nAChRs were not detected in most of type 3, 5, 6, and rod bipolar cells. We found that 7-nAChRs are present in bipolar cells in a type-specific manner. Because these bipolar cells provide synaptic inputs to SACs and direction selective ganglion cells, 7-nAChRs may play a role in direction selectivity by modulating these bipolar cells' outputs. "
Exploring patients' expectations and preferences of glaucoma surgery outcomes to facilitate healthcare delivery and inform future glaucoma research.,"This study aimed to analyse microstructure data on the density and orientation of collagen fibrils in whole eye globes and to propose an effective method for the preparation of data for use in numerical simulations of the eye's biomechanical performance. Wide-angle X-ray scattering was applied to seven healthy ex-vivo human eyes. Each eye was dissected into an anterior and a posterior cup, and radial incisions were used to flatten the tissue before microstructure characterisation. A method was developed to use the microstructure data obtained for the dissected tissue to build realistic 3D maps of fibril density and orientation covering the whole eye globe. At the central cornea, 61.52.3% of fibrils were aligned within 45 sectors surrounding the two orthogonal directions. In contrast, more than one-third of the total fibril content was concentrated along the circumferential direction at the limbus (37.02.4%) and around the optic nerve head (34.82.1%). The insertion locations of the four recti muscles exhibited a preference in the meridional direction near the equator (38.63.9%). There was also a significant difference in fibril density between the limbus and other regions (ratio = 1.910.45, p <0.01 at the central cornea and ratio = 0.800.21, p <0.01 at the posterior pole). Characterisation of collagen fibril density and orientation across the whole ocular surface has been possible but required the use of a technique that involved tissue dissection and hence caused tissue damage. The method presented in this paper aimed to minimise the effect of dissection on the quality of obtained data and was successful in identifying fibril distribution trends that were compatible with earlier studies, which concentrated on localised areas of the ocular globe. "
Comparison of optic coherence tomography results in patients with diagnosed epilepsy: Findings in favor of neurodegeneration.,"This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the incidence of secondary glaucoma in patients under the age of 2 years who underwent congenital cataract surgery with or without primary intraocular lens (IOL) implantation. An electronic literature search was performed in Medline, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases to retrieve studies between January 2011 and November 2018. Patients with congenital cataract who did primary IOL implantation, aphakia, or secondary IOL implantation followed by receiving extraction surgery were included in this study. Relevant studies meeting defined eligibility criteria were selected and reviewed systematically by meta-analysis. Long-term incidences of secondary glaucoma, which developed at least one year after cataract surgery, were considered and discussed as clinical outcomes in each cohort. The pooled data were analyzed according to a random effects model. Eight publications involving 892 eyes were included in the current meta-analysis. In the general population of eyes with congenital cataract, the long-term incidence of secondary glaucoma was lower (P = 0.06) in eyes with primary IOL (9.5%) than in eyes without primary IOL (15.1%), including aphakia and secondary IOL. The pooled risk ratio (RR) favors primary IOL implantation in all patients (RR = 0.63). For bilateral congenital cataract, the incidence was 6.7% in eyes with primary IOL implantation, which is significantly lower than the 16.7% in eyes with aphakia and secondary IOL implantation (P<0.05, RR = 0.44). However, for unilateral congenital cataract surgery, the incidence was very similar in eyes with and without primary IOL (12.4% vs 12.0%, P = 0.61, RR = 0.87). In patients under 2 years of age, primary IOL implantation for bilateral congenital cataract surgery is associated with a lower risk of secondary glaucoma. "
Adjunctive dexamethasone implant in patients with atopic dermatitis and retinal detachment undergoing vitrectomy and silicone oil tamponade: an interventional case series.,"The stream of visual information sent from photoreceptors to second-order bipolar cells is intercepted by laterally interacting horizontal cells that generate feedback to optimize and improve the efficiency of signal transmission. The mechanisms underlying the regulation of graded photoreceptor synaptic output in this nonspiking network have remained elusive. Here, we analyze with patch clamp recording the novel mechanisms by which horizontal cells control pH in the synaptic cleft to modulate photoreceptor neurotransmitter release. First, we show that mammalian horizontal cells respond to their own GABA release and that the results of this autaptic action affect cone voltage-gated Ca2+ channel (CaV channel) gating through changes in pH. As a proof-of-principle, we demonstrate that chemogenetic manipulation of horizontal cells with exogenous anion channel expression mimics GABA-mediated cone CaV channel inhibition. Activation of these GABA receptor anion channels can depolarize horizontal cells and increase cleft acidity via Na+/H+ exchanger (NHE) proton extrusion, which results in inhibition of cone CaV channels. This action is effectively counteracted when horizontal cells are sufficiently hyperpolarized by increased GABA receptor (GABAR)-mediated HCO3- efflux, alkalinizing the cleft and disinhibiting cone CaV channels. This demonstrates how hybrid actions of GABA operate in parallel to effect voltage-dependent pH changes, a novel mechanism for regulating synaptic output. "
Epidemiology and clinical features of viral anterior uveitis in southern Taiwan-diagnosis with polymerase chain reaction.,"To evaluate the effects of different contact lens (CL) replacement schedules and different CL materials on the ocular surface and tear function. Daily disposable hydrogel CLs were given to group 1 (n = 22), daily disposable silicone hydrogel CLs were given to group 2 (n = 25), and reusable silicone hydrogel CLs were given to group 3 (n = 24). Tear function tests and inflammatory cytokine [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, IL-17A, and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9] levels were evaluated before and at 1 and 3 months after CL usage. Impression cytology was evaluated before and at 3 months after CL usage. At the first and third months of CL usage, a statistically significant difference was determined between the groups in the levels of IL-6, IL-8, and IL-17A in tears, with the lowest levels in group 1 and the highest levels in group 3 (all P < 0.05). At the third month of CL usage, the levels of these cytokines (in picograms/milliliter) were 6.06  0.83, 78.18  12.42, 61.69  13.95, and 37.71  5.95 in group 1 and 8.04  0.89, 107.34  14.40, 68.63  13.72, and 46.26  6.50 in group 3, respectively. A statistically significant decrease was determined over time in the Schirmer test in group 1, in only the tear breakup time in group 2, and in the tear breakup time and Schirmer test in group 3 (all P < 0.05). A statistically significant increase was determined over time in the levels of IL-6, IL-8, IL-17A, and MMP-9 in all groups. In the third month, a significant progression was observed in the Nelson grade (P < 0.05) in all groups. The wear of daily disposable CLs can be considered to cause less damage to the ocular surface and less increase in proinflammatory cytokine levels. "
Intraocular pressure control after trans-scleral intraocular lens fixation in glaucoma patients.,"To compare the symptoms and signs of dry eye disease (DED) in children with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with those in healthy children using common diagnostic tools. Prospective, observational, single-center cohort study. Thirty-four subjects with SLE and 15 healthy subjects were recruited from the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto, Canada. Subjects underwent subjective and objective dry eye assessments using the Canadian Dry Eye Assessment (CDEA) questionnaire, tear film osmolarity, slit lamp examination, tear film break-up time, corneal fluorescein staining, Schirmer test 1, and conjunctival lissamine green staining. No difference in symptoms was found between children with SLE and healthy children (CDEA score 6.4  5.4 vs. 3.8  3.2; P = 0.09). Corneal staining was more prevalent in children with SLE than in healthy children (58.8% vs. 20.0%; P = 0.01), and children with SLE had higher mean corneal fluorescein staining scores (1.7  1.7 vs. 0.2  0.4; P = 0.002). No statistically significant differences in tear osmolarity, inter-eye differences in tear osmolarity, tear film break-up time, Schirmer test 1, or lissamine green staining scores were observed between the 2 groups. In healthy children, CDEA scores weakly correlated with corneal fluorescein staining score (r = 0.53, P = 0.04). In children with SLE, no correlation between CDEA score and any of the diagnostic test outcomes was found. There is discordance between symptoms and signs of DED in children with SLE. Corneal fluorescein staining is essential for the diagnosis of DED in these children. "
Standard and accelerated corneal cross-linking long-term results: A randomized clinical trial.,"Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a trophic factor for corneal nerves (CNs). Despite its widespread use to treat a variety of retinal diseases, the effect of repetitive intravitreal (IV) anti-VEGF injections on CN is not known. Retrospective case-control study. CN parameters were compared between eyes in 39 individuals who received anti-VEGF injections in one eye only. Next, we compared CN parameters between 50 eyes of 50 individuals with a history of IV anti-VEGF injections and 80 eyes of 80 individuals without a history of injection. In vivo confocal microscopic examination was conducted using the ConfoScan 4. Images were analyzed by the Corneal Nerve Analysis tool. Paired and independent t test methodologies were used to compare nerve parameters, and multivariable linear regression analysis was performed to control for potential confounders. In 39 patients (own controls), eyes with a history of IV injection had lower CN length density, total length, nerve fibers, bifurcations, and branches (P < 0.005) compared to the fellow eyes without injection. Similar findings were seen in the eyes of 50 individuals with a history of injection compared to 80 individuals without injection. A history of IV injections and ethnicity remained significantly associated with the CN length density and explained 32% of the variability (R = 0.56). We found decreased CN parameters in eyes with a history of anti-VEGF injections compared to eyes without such a history. "
The circadian protein CLOCK regulates cell metabolism via the mitochondrial carrier SLC25A10.,"Corneal transplantation is the standard of care for pediatric corneal opacities, but little consensus exists on optimal surgical management. Our goal was to evaluate cross-sectional data of donor and recipient characteristics collected from eye banks providing tissue for pediatric corneal transplant cases to assess surgical trends in pediatric keratoplasty over the past 13 years. We performed a retrospective review of recipient data, collected from 4 major eye banks, for pediatric patients (<18 years) who underwent corneal transplantation between January 2005 and December 2017. We analyzed trends in surgical indications, types of keratoplasty, and donor/recipient characteristics. Our database included 2620 total pediatric cases. Penetrating keratoplasty (PKP) remains the most common surgery performed (79.8%), but more partial-thickness transplant cases [eg, endothelial keratoplasty (EK)] have been performed since 2008. The most commonly reported transplant indication was ectasias/thinnings (34.1%) overall and congenital opacities (17.0%) in children less than 5 years. Average donor age was significantly lower for the youngest recipient age group of less than 5 years (P < 0.001); endothelial cell count was also higher, and death-to-surgery time was lower for PKP and EK cases versus other keratoplasties. Indications for transplant vary across age groups but are consistent with previous reports. Popularity of partial-thickness transplants has increased since 2008. Surgeons prefer younger donor tissue for younger patients and have higher thresholds for endothelial cell count for PKP and EK cases. Centralized tracking of pediatric keratoplasty cases is necessary for further investigation of long-term outcomes. "
A 2-Year Longitudinal Study of Normal Cone Photoreceptor Density.,"Perimetry is a non-invasive clinical psychometric examination used for diagnosing ophthalmic and neurological conditions. At its core, perimetry relies on a subject pressing a button whenever they see a visual stimulus within their field of view. This sequential process then yields a 2D visual field image that is critical for clinical use. Perimetry is painfully slow however, with examinations lasting 7-8 minutes per eye. Maintaining high levels of concentration during that time is exhausting for the patient and negatively affects the acquired visual field. We introduce PASS, a novel perimetry testing strategy, based on reinforcement learning, that requires fewer locations in order to effectively estimate 2D visual fields. PASS uses a selection policy that determines what locations should be tested in order to reconstruct the complete visual field as accurately as possible, and then separately reconstructs the visual field from sparse observations. Furthermore, PASS is patient-specific and non-greedy. It adaptively selects what locations to query based on the patient's answers to previous queries, and the locations are jointly selected to maximize the quality of the final reconstruction. In our experiments, we show that PASS outperforms state-of-the-art methods, leading to more accurate reconstructions while reducing between 30% and 70% the duration of the patient examination. "
Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography Quantitative Assessment of Exercise-Induced Variations in Retinal Vascular Plexa of Healthy Subjects.,"We previously reported that a specific treadmill running exercise regimen protects against light-induced retinal degeneration (LIRD) in mice. We hypothesized that this protective effect varies with running intensity. To test this, mice undergoing LIRD were run at different treadmill speeds and retinal function was assessed. BALB/c mice were assigned to LIRD groups at varying treadmill speeds-0, 5, 10, or 20 m/min labeled inactive, low, medium, and high, respectively-and compared with nave mice exposed to standard lighting (50 lux; nave). Following 2 weeks of exercise, a subset of mice were exposed to toxic light (10,000 lux; LIRD) for 4 hours. After 5 additional days of exercise, retinal function was assessed by ERG. Corticosterone levels in serum and cathepsin B (CTSB) protein levels in muscle, brain, serum, and retina were measured. The retinal gene expression of complement factor 1qa (C1qa) and CTSB were measured. The low+LIRD and medium+LIRD exercise groups had greater a- and b-wave ERG amplitudes when compared with the inactive+LIRD group (P < 0.02). The high+LIRD mice only differed from the inactive+LIRD mice in their dark-adapted b-waves. Serum corticosterone increased in the high+LIRD mice (P < 0.006). Retinal CTSB protein levels were higher in the low+LIRD versus high+LIRD mice (P < 0.004) but were otherwise unchanged. Exercise of any intensity decreased C1qa gene expression. Faster running did not additionally protect against LIRD, but it did increase serum corticosterone, suggesting stress-induced limits to exercise benefits. Unexpectedly, exercise did not increase CTSB proteins levels in muscle or serum, suggesting that it may not mediate exercise effects. Our results have implications for the use of low-intensity exercise as a vision loss treatment. "
Discordance of Disc-Fovea Raphe Angles Determined by Optical Coherence Tomography and MP-3 Microperimetry in Eyes With a Glaucomatous Hemifield Defect.,"Reduced perfusion of the retinal parapapillary tissue is well documented in glaucoma patients. Whether or not this is a cause or result of the disease is however unknown. Studying the correlation of this perfusion and the retinal vascular oxygen saturation (O2S) could give clues to the retinal O2 consumption/demand and provide an answer to this question. Seventeen eyes of 17 healthy controls and 32 eyes of 32 patients with primary open angle glaucoma were prospectively recruited. Global and sectoral nerve fiber layer (NFL) thickness was measured with optical coherence tomography (OCT); parapapillary OCT-angiography was performed and quantified into vascular density (VD) and perfusion density (PD). Retinal vascular O2S was measured. Global and sectoral NFL thickness, VD, PD (except for temporal sector of VD), and arteriovenous difference of O2S (AV-D) were lower in glaucomatous eyes compared with controls (P < 0.05 for all). A significant inverse correlation of venous O2S with global VD (r = -0.37, P = 0.04) and PD (r = -0.37, P = 0.04) and a direct correlation of the AV-D with global VD (r = 0.50, P = 0.004) and PD (r = 0.49, P = 0.004) were observed. In sector analysis, the strongest correlation of AV-D with VD and PD was seen in inferior (VD: r = 0.52, P = 0.001; PD: r = 0.55, P = 0.002) and superior (VD: r = 0.454, P = 0.009; PD: r = 0.46, P = 0.008) segments. In glaucomatous eyes, there exists a direct correlation of the AV-D to the VD and PD with the strongest correlation being in superior and inferior segments where typically tissue loss occurs. This could possibly be explained by the loss of tissue being followed by the reduced density. "
Biomarkers for PVR in rhegmatogenous retinal detachment.,"To report occurrence of acute severe inflammation after surgical implantation of mycoplasma-infected induced pluripotent stem cell-derived RPE (iPS-RPE) cells into the eyes of healthy primates, and determine the immunopathological mechanisms of the inflammation. Ophthalmic allogeneic transplantation of iPS-RPE cells was performed in the subretina of major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-matched (two eyes) and MHC-mismatched (one eye) healthy cynomolgus monkeys. The clinical course after transplantation was observed using color fundus photography, fluorescence angiography, and optical coherence tomography. After the animals were killed at 1 month after surgery, eyeballs were removed and pathologically examined. Microorganisms were analyzed by PCR methods and BLAST analysis using preserved graft iPS-RPE cells and the recipients' vitreous humor. Mixed lymphocyte-RPE assay was performed on the mycoplasma-infected and noninfected iPS-RPE cells in vitro. In tested eyes, abnormal findings were observed in the grafted retina 2 weeks after surgery. Here, we observed retinal vasculitis and hemorrhage, retinal detachment, and infiltration of inflammatory cells into the retina of the eyes. One month after surgery, animals were killed due to the severe immune responses observed. Using PCR methods, sequence analysis detected mycoplasma-DNA (Mycoplasma arginini species) in both the grafted RPE cells and the collected vitreous fluids of the monkeys. Mixed lymphocyte-RPE assay revealed that the infected iPS-RPE cells enhanced the proliferation of inflammatory cells in vitro. Transplantation of graft iPS-RPE cells contaminated with mycoplasma into the subretina caused severe ocular inflammation. Mycoplasma possesses the ability to cause immune responses in the host. "
Application of SPF moisturisers is inferior to sunscreens in coverage of facial and eyelid regions.,"To characterize retinal morphology differences among different types of choroidal neovascularization and visual function changes at the onset of exudative age-related macular degeneration. In a post hoc analysis of a prospective clinical study, 1,097 fellow eyes from subjects with choroidal neovascularization in the study eye enrolled in the HARBOR trial were evaluated. The onset of exudation was diagnosed on monthly optical coherence tomography by two masked graders. At conversion as well as 1 month earlier, pigment epithelial detachment, intraretinal cystoid fluid, subretinal fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material, as well as ellipsoid zone and external limiting membrane loss were quantitatively analyzed. Hyperreflective foci, retinal pigment epithelial defects, haze and vitreoretinal interface status were evaluated qualitatively. Main outcome measures included visual acuity and rates of morphologic features at conversion and 1 month earlier. New-onset exudation was detected in 92 eyes. One month before conversion, hyperreflective foci, pigment epithelial detachment, retinal pigment epithelial defects, and haze were present in the majority of eyes. At the onset of exudation, the volumes of intraretinal cystoid fluid, subretinal fluid, subretinal hyperreflective material and pigment epithelial detachment, and the areas of external limiting membrane and ellipsoid zone loss significantly increased. The mean vision loss was -2.2 letters. Pathognomonic patterns of the different choroidal neovascularization types were already apparent 1 month before conversion. Characteristic choroidal neovascularization-associated morphological changes are preceding disease conversion, while vision loss at the onset of exudation is minimal. Individual lesion types are related to specific changes in optical coherence tomography morphology already before the time of conversion. Our findings may help to elucidate the pathophysiology of neovascular age-related macular degeneration and support the diagnosis of imminent disease conversion. "
Efficacy and safety of certolizumab pegol and golimumab in the treatment of non-infectious uveitis.,"To analyze the correlation between preoperative measurements of macular microstructures and aniseikonia after epiretinal membrane removal. This retrospective study included 32 eyes of 32 patients who underwent epiretinal membrane surgery and were followed up for 12 months. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was used to measure the thicknesses of the ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer, inner nuclear layer (INL), and outer retinal layer in macular microstructures. The new aniseikonia test was used to measure vertical and horizontal aniseikonia scores. There was a significant decrease in central macular thickness and ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer thickness at 6 and 12 months postoperatively (all P < 0.001). Vertical aniseikonia scores, horizontal aniseikonia scores, and INL and outer retinal layer thicknesses did not show significant changes. Vertical aniseikonia scores and horizontal aniseikonia scores were significantly associated with INL thicknesses of each meridian at each follow-up time point (all P < 0.05). Preoperative vertical and horizontal INL thicknesses were correlated with vertical aniseikonia scores and horizontal aniseikonia scores at 12 months postoperatively (P = 0.014 and P = 0.002, respectively). Aniseikonia values did not change after epiretinal membrane removal and were associated with INL thickness before and after surgery. Thus, preoperative INL thickness could be used as a predictor of surgical prognosis in epiretinal membrane patients. "
Papilledema from gain-of-function mutations in the STAT3 gene.,"To report patients who demonstrated an alteration in the clinical and optical coherence tomography features of neovascular age-related macular degeneration after resolution of endophthalmitis. Retrospective case series of the subsequent changes in the macula and need for anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration who developed endophthalmitis after intravitreal injection. The study included seven eyes of seven patients with follow-up ranging between 3 months and 11 years. The vitreous cultures (n = 7) before intravitreal antibiotic injection were the following: culture-negative (4) and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (3). Initial treatment included vitreous tap and injection (4) and pars plana vitrectomy (3). In 5/7 eyes, the optical coherence tomography showed resolution of subretinal fluid and serous pigment epithelial detachment, and there was no additional anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment administered. After successful treatment of endophthalmitis in patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration, there was relative involution of the maculopathy and reduced anti-vascular endothelial growth factor treatment burden in this series. "
A novel NHS mutation in a Chinese family with NanceHoran Syndrome.,"To describe a novel fluorescein angiographic finding in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease. Retrospective case series of patients diagnosed with retinal capillary hemangioblastoma (RCH) in the setting of von Hippel-Lindau. We identified six eyes of three patients with von Hippel-Lindau and leaky retinal vessels. All eyes showed segmental diffuse vascular leakage (SDVL) that was seen in the late phase of the angiogram and that originated from third order and more peripheral retinal veins and adjacent capillaries. These vessels did not drain from the RCHs. Segmental diffuse vascular leakage was mainly seen in the mid and far periphery. In some cases, it was located near the RCHs, while in other cases, it was remote. Segmental diffuse vascular leakage was also seen in one eye without RCHs. On follow-up, the extent and intensity of segmental diffuse vascular leakage did not change after the RCHs were treated with laser or cryotherapy. Diffuse vascular leakage from retinal venules around and away from RCHs in patients with von Hippel-Lindau disease is seen, but the clinical and prognostic importance of this finding is uncertain. "
Sanguinarine induces apoptosis of human lens epithelial cells by increasing reactive oxygen species via the MAPK signaling pathway.,"The objective was to determine if the absence of FasL signaling would affect melanoma liver metastases by influencing the antimelanoma properties of liver natural killer (NK) cells. Melanoma liver metastases were induced in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and the gld/gld mutant C57BL/6 mouse strain that expresses a defective form of FasL (CD95L) that fails to engage and signal via the Fas receptor (CD95). Liver metastases were produced by intrasplenic injection of B16LS9 melanoma cells. Liver NK cell activity directed against murine B16LS9 melanoma cells was determined in a 24h in-vitro cytotoxicity assay. Liver NK cells, NK T cells, and the NK cell surface activation marker, NKG2D, were measured by flow cytometry. Mice expressing defective FasL displayed reduced, rather than enhanced, melanoma liver metastases that coincided with increased liver NK cell-mediated tumor cell cytotoxicity. Enhanced cytotoxicity was not mediated by perforin, tumor necrosis factor-, or tumor necrosis-associated apoptosis-inducing ligand but was closely associated with elevated interferon- in the tumor-bearing liver. FasL-defective gld/gld mice also displayed reduced numbers of liver NK T cells, which have been previously implicated in suppression on liver NK cell activity. The absence of functional FasL in the liver correlates with a heightened, not diminished, resistance to melanoma liver metastases. The resistance to liver metastases coincides with a significant, albeit transient, increase in liver NK cytotoxicity and elevated levels of interferon- in the liver. "
Gut microbiota and immunity in common variable immunodeficiency: crosstalk with pro-inflammatory cytokines.,"This study aimed to investigate the microRNA (miRNA) profile in primary tumors from conjunctival melanoma with and without subsequent metastatic spread along with their coupled distant metastases to identify miRNAs likely to be involved in metastatic progression. This observational study included 13 patients with metastatic conjunctival melanoma (follow-up: 1-39 years) treated at a Danish referral center. Twenty-five patients with nonmetastatic conjunctival melanoma (follow-up: 5-17 years) were included for comparison. Global miRNA profiling was performed with the Affymetrix GeneChip 4.1 microarray. Taqman qPCR arrays were used for validation. Significant differentially expressed miRNAs were defined as having a false discovery rate of less than 0.05. Primary conjunctival melanoma with and without subsequent metastatic spread clustered separately according to miRNA expression, and 15 miRNAs were found to have significant differential expression. Six miRNAs (hsa-miR-4528, hsa-miR-1270, hsa-miR-1290, hsa-mir-548f-4, hsa-mir-4278, and hsa-miR-34a-3p) were downregulated and nine miRNAs were upregulated (hsa-mir-575, hsa-miR-527, hsa-miR-518a-5p, hsa-miR-6759-5p, hsa-miR-8078, hsa-mir-4501, hsa-mir-622, hsa-mir-4698, and hsa-mir-4654) in primary conjunctival melanoma with subsequent metastatic spread. A comparison of primary conjunctival melanoma with their pair-matched metastases identified six significant differentially expressed miRNAs (hsa-miR-1246 and hsa-miR-302d-5p, hsa-mir-6084, hsa-miR-184, hsa-mir-658, and hsa-mir-4427). qPCR confirmed downregulation of hsa-miR-184 in the distant metastases when compared with the corresponding primary tumor. Primary conjunctival melanoma with and without subsequent metastatic spread separated clearly on the miRNA level when profiled with microarray-based methods. qPCR was able to replicate expression levels of one miRNA (hsa-miR-184) that was downregulated in metastases when compared with corresponding primary tumors.

"[Effects of acupuncture, <i>tuina</i> combined with phacoemulsification for cataract with glaucoma].","N-chlorotaurine (NCT) is an anti-infective belonging to the class of chloramines and an investigative drug for the topical treatment of keratoconjunctivitis. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate its efficacy against Acanthamoeba and Candida in corneas infected ex vivo. Corneal buttons from porcine eyes were contaminated with Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites or Candida albicans Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures 5982 and incubated for 7 and 3 days, respectively. Subsequently, they were treated with 1% NCT for 5 to 120 minutes. After further incubation for 2 days in the absence of NCT in tests with A. castellanii, the buttons were homogenized, and the amoebae grown for a further 5 days before they were counted in a light microscope. For C. albicans, quantitative cultures were performed from corneal homogenates. Incubation of 120 minutes in NCT completely inhibited the regrowth of A. castellanii and reduced the number of C. albicans colony-forming unit counts by 4 log10. In addition, at 60 minutes, significant reductions of both pathogens could be observed. Histology showed penetration of pathogens into the stroma of the corneal buttons. NCT inactivates A. castellanii and C. albicans in corneal tissue. "
"[Acupuncture prescription of ""<i>Wei</i>\'s triple nine needling therapy"" in the treatment of optic nerve disease].","Myopia is one of the most prevalent eye diseases, and its advanced form, high myopia, is a leading cause of subsequent pathologic myopia, which in turn results in an increased risk of retinal diseases. The prevalence of myopia and high myopia is 28.3% and 4.0% of the global population, respectively, and these numbers are estimated to increase to 49.8% for myopia 9.8% for high myopia by 2050, thus making myopia a severe global socioeconomic problem. The eye shape has been receiving increasing attention as a possible biomarker for myopia. Among several modalities, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is currently considered to be the best to measure the 3-dimensional eye shape, and one study using MRI revealed that myopic eyes became much larger in all 3 dimensions, but more so in length (0.35 mm/D) than in height (0.19 mm/D) or in width (0.10 mm/D), which fitted in global and axial elongation models. Another recent study reported that emmetropic retinas were oblate but oblateness decreased with myopia progression. According to a study to evaluate eye shapes in high myopia, although all emmetropic eyes had a blunt shape, almost half of the high myopic eyes had a pointed shape. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that abnormal eye shape changes can cause not only simple myopia but also various ocular complications through biomechanical stretching. In this review, we highlight recent findings on eye shape changes in myopic eyes and abnormal eye shapes in pathologic myopia. "
[Effect on the pain and tear film stability in patients after pterygium excision treated with intradermal needling].,"Glaucoma used to be the most common cause for blindness in Iceland. As the incidence of glaucoma increases with age, the patients often have numerous comorbidities and use various medications. It is important to keep in mind interactions and side effects of glaucoma medications when deciding systemic medical treatment for these patients to ensure their safety and comfort. The goal of the study was to gather information about drug use of patients with severe glaucoma. A retrospective study where data were collected from 100 consecutive patients who underwent a trabeculectomy as first glaucoma surgery at Landspitali National University Hospital of Iceland during 2013-2017. All systemic and ophthalmic medications during 6 months before and after the surgery, medical diagnoses, age and gender of the patients were registered. Of all 100 patients, 87 used systemic medication, averaging 5.3 drugs/patient. Mean number of glaucoma medication used was 3.0. Mean age at surgery was 75 years and 53 were women. The most common systemic drug class was anti-hypertensives, used by 57 patients where beta-blockers were the most common, used by 30 patients. Zopiclone was the most common single drug, used by 29 patients. It is evident that patients with glaucoma take various drugs for systemic illness that can affect their glaucoma and have interactions with glaucoma drugs. It is urgent that healthcare providers keep this in mind when deciding on systemic treatment for patients with glaucoma, with regards to possible interactions with glaucoma drugs and the effect on patient's overall health.

Prophylactic treatment of intraocular pressure elevation after uncomplicated cataract surgery in nonglaucomatous eyes - a systematic review.,"The brain, spinal cord, and retina are supplied by capillaries that do not permit free diffusion of molecules between serum and parenchyma, a property that defines the blood-brain and blood-retina barriers. Exceptions to this pattern are found in circumventricular organs (CVOs), small midline brain structures that are supplied by high permeability capillaries. In the eye and brain, high permeability capillaries are also present in the choriocapillaris, which supplies the retinal pigment epithelium and photoreceptors, and the ciliary body and choroid plexus, the sources of aqueous humor and cerebrospinal fluid, respectively. We show here that (1) endothelial cells in these high permeability vascular systems have very low beta-catenin signaling compared to barrier-competent endothelial cells, and (2) elevating beta-catenin signaling leads to a partial conversion of permeable endothelial cells to a barrier-type state. In one CVO, the area postrema, high permeability is maintained, in part, by local production of Wnt inhibitory factor-1. "
External cephalic version at term: A 6-year single-operator experience.,"To investigate the effects of a lutein complex supplementation on ocular blood flow in healthy subjects. Sixteen healthy female patients (mean age 36.812.1years) were enrolled in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, two-period crossover study. Subjects received daily an oral dose of the lutein with synergistic phytochemicals complex (lutein (10mg), ascorbic acid (500mg), tocopherols (364mg), carnosic acid (2.5mg), zeaxanthin (2mg), copper (2mg), with synergistic effects in reducing pro-inflammatory mediators and cytokines when administered together in combination) and placebo during administration periods. Measurements were taken before and after three-week supplementation periods, with crossover visits separated by a three-week washout period. Data analysis included blood pressure, heart rate, intraocular pressure, visual acuity, contrast sensitivity detection, ocular perfusion pressure, confocal scanning laser Doppler imaging of retinal capillary blood flow, and Doppler imaging of the retrobulbar blood vessels. Lutein complex supplementation produced a statistically significant increase in mean superior retinal capillary blood flow, measured in arbitrary units (60, p=0.0466) and a decrease in the percentage of avascular area in the superior (-0.029, p=0.0491) and inferior (-0.023, p=0.0477) retina, as well as reduced systolic (-4.06, p=0.0295) and diastolic (-3.69, p=0.0441) blood pressure measured in mmHg from baseline. Data comparison between the two supplement groups revealed a significant decrease in systemic diastolic blood pressure (change from pre- to post-treatment with lutein supplement (mean (SE)): -3.69 (1.68); change from pre- to post-treatment with placebo: 0.31 (2.57); p=0.0357) and a significant increase in the peak systolic velocity (measured in cm/sec) in the central retinal artery (change from pre- to post-treatment with lutein supplement: 0.36 (0.19); change from pre- to post-treatment with placebo: -0.33 (0.21); p=0.0384) with lutein complex supplement; data analyses from the placebo group were all non-significant. In healthy participants, oral administration of a lutein phytochemicals complex for three weeks produced increased ocular blood flow biomarkers within retinal vascular beds and reduced diastolic blood pressure compared to placebo.

Vegetating lesions in secondary syphilis. Reply from authors.,"To clinically and genetically characterise a second family with dominant ARL3-related retinitis pigmentosa due to a specific ARL3 missense variant, p.(Tyr90Cys). Clinical examination included optical coherence tomography, electroretinography, and ultra-wide field retinal imaging with autofluorescence. Retrospective data were collected from the registry of inherited retinal diseases at Oslo university hospital. DNA was analysed by whole-exome sequencing and Sanger sequencing. The ARL3 missense variant was visualized in a 3D-protein structure. The phenotype was non-syndromic retinitis pigmentosa with cataract associated with early onset of decreased central vision and central retinal thinning. Sanger sequencing confirmed the presence of a de novo ARL3 missense variant p.(Tyr90Cys) in the index patient and his affected son. We did not find any other cases with rare ARL3 variants in a cohort of 431 patients with retinitis pigmentosa-like disease. By visualizing Tyr90 in the 3D protein structure, it seems to play an important role in packing of the / structure of ADP-ribosylation factor-like 3 (ARL3). When changing Tyr90 to cysteine, we observe a loss of interactions in the core of the / structure that is likely to affect folding and stability of ARL3. Our study confirms that the ARL3 missense variant p.(Tyr90Cys) causes retinitis pigmentosa. In 2016, Strom et al. reported the exact same variant in a mother and two children with RP, labelled ?RP83 in the OMIM database. Now the questionmark can be removed, and ARL3 should be added to the list of genes that may cause non-syndromic dominant retinitis pigmentosa. "
Video recording and light intensity change analysis during cataract surgery using an animal model.,"Orbital lesions vary in their classification, incidence, and presentation depending on the age and geographic distribution. Such lesions in the pediatric age group have been studied extensively because of the possibility of faster progression of orbital involvement and the higher risk of morbidity in this age group in which vision is still developing. In Saudi Arabia, orbital lesions were studied over a 6-year period in the late 1980s, when retinoblastoma cases used to present late with orbital involvement. In this study, we revisited the same topic 20 years later aiming to find out the most recent prevalence of orbital lesions in a similar population of patients over a longer period (14 years) in the same eye center, and compare the current results to other reports worldwide. A total of 107 lesions from 106 patients were identified by tissue diagnosis, of which more than half of the lesions were benign cystic (being the most common), vasculogenic, and inflammatory in 63% [95% confidence interval (CI, 53.3-72.0)] of all biopsied lesions. Neoplasms accounted for 37% [95% CI (28.0-45.8)] with rhabdomyosarcoma being the most common, accounting for about one third of neoplasms, and no orbital cases of retinoblastoma were found. Our results demonstrated different distribution of orbital lesions in recent years reflecting the indirect effect of the improved health awareness and medical care in Saudi Arabia. This baseline demographic study is expected to be helpful for further clinical and prognostic studies with emphasis on pediatric orbital malignant lesions, their clinical presentation, management, and prognosis.

Optimizing esthetic outcomes in graded full-thickness anterior blepharotomy for Graves' ophthalmopathy.,"Myopic traction maculopathy of the retinoschisis type is a unique entity that has been frequently overlooked in refraction correction in daily practice in myopic eyes. The objective of this study was to describe the imaging characteristics of myopic traction maculopathy (MTM) seen on optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) and to detect biomarkers of the associated functional changes. We performed OCTA on eyes with MTM and retinoschisis (RS group; n=27) and highly myopic eyes without MTM (control group; n=27). The RS group was further divided into a dome-shaped macula (DSM) group and a non-DSM group. The groups were compared for morphologic and perfusion characteristics. The RS and control groups had comparable spherical equivalence (p=0.65), but the RS group had worse best-corrected visual acuity (p<0.01), larger retinal volumes (p<0.01), and greater subfoveal choroid capillary vessel density values (p=0.04). Compared to the non-DSM group, the DSM group had significantly smaller inner retinal volumes (p=0.05) and significantly larger choroid capillary vessel density values in both the whole macula (p=0.005) and the fovea (p=0.03). Our high-resolution OCTA morphologic and vascular perfusion data correlated well with functional abnormalities encountered in myopic eyes. Changes in vessel density may elucidate the pathogenesis of MTM and characterize the mechanical stretch forces acting in eyes with MTM. "
[Importance of interdisciplinary collaboration for optimal treatment of orbital tumors].,"To analyze the surgical and sensory outcomes of intermittent exotropia according to refractive errors and the factors associated with surgical success. A total of 326 children were divided into three groups according to preoperative refractive error; hyperopic eyes with SE +2D (hyperopic group), eyes with SE between -1D and +2D (emmetropic group), and myopic eyes with SE -1D (myopic group). The surgical outcomes and the sensory outcomes measured by near and distant stereoacuity were compared among the three groups. The surgical success rate in hyperopic group was significantly lower compared to myopic group at last follow-up (P=0.012). Preoperative near stereopsis was not different among three groups, however, the distance stereopsis was significantly deteriorated in the hyperopic group compared to the other two groups (Titmus; P=0.168, FD2; P<0.001, DR; P=0.048). There was postoperative improvement in both near and distant stereopsis in all three groups (Titmus; P=0.009, FD2; P=0.021, DR; P=0.036) and no significant difference was found in the postoperative distant stereopsis among the three groups. Preoperative refractive error is a prognostic factor of surgical success in patients with intermittent exotropia. Patients with hyperopia achieved less favorable surgical outcome compared to myopic patients. The preoperative distant stereoacuity was decreased in hyperopic patients compared to myopic patients, which eventually improved after surgery and showed no significant difference at postoperative measurements.

A Comparison Among Different Automatically Segmented Slabs to Assess Neovascular AMD using Swept Source OCT Angiography.,"This study aims to evaluate the photoreceptor outer segment (PROS) length in patients who use hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) prior to the development of retinopathy. In this prospective, single-centre, comparative study, 44 patients using HCQ for 5 years, 30 patients using HCQ <5 years, and 45 age- and sex-matched healthy controls were enrolled. The participants underwent a detailed ophthalmologic examination, spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging, and 10-2 automated visual field testing. The PROS length was defined as the distance between the inner surface of the ellipsoid zone and the inner surface of the retina pigment epithelium. The measurements were performed subfoveally and at 500-1000-1500m temporally and nasally to the foveola. The mean PROS length of long-term users (5 years) was statistically greater than the controls at all measurement points (p<0.001 at all points). Although the subfoveal PROS length was comparable between the long-term and short-term users (p=0.148), the parafoveal PROS length measurements (nasal 1500m, nasal 1000m, nasal 500m, temporal 1000m, and temporal 1500m) of the long-term users were significantly greater than those of the short-term users (p<0.001, p=0.002, p=0.027, p=0.018, p=0.001, respectively). No significant difference was found between the short-term users and the controls (p=0.815, p=0.395, p=0.093, p=0.079, p=0.133, p=0.686, p=0.341, respectively). The PROS length was greater in patients who used HCQ 5 years. Possible retinal pigment epithelium toxicity may have caused this finding. "
Particle-Mediated Gene Transfection and Organotypic Culture of Postmortem Human Retina.,"To evaluate the relationship between prenatal and postnatal inflammation-related risk factors and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). The study included infants born <30 weeks in California from 2007 to 2011. Multivariable log-binomial regression was used to assess the association between prenatal and postnatal inflammation-related exposures and severe ROP, defined as stage 3-5 or surgery for ROP. Of 14,816 infants, 10.8% developed severe ROP. Though prenatal inflammation-related risk factors were initially associated with severe ROP, after accounting for the effect of these risk factors on gestational age at birth through mediation analysis, the association was non-significant (P=0.6). Postnatal factors associated with severe ROP included prolonged oxygen exposure, sepsis, intraventricular hemorrhage, and necrotizing enterocolitis. Postnatal inflammation-related factors were associated with severe ROP more strongly than prenatal factors. The association between prenatal inflammation-related factors and ROP was explained by earlier gestational age in infants exposed to prenatal inflammation. "
"Differences in Anterior Chamber Angle Assessments Between Gonioscopy, EyeCam, and Anterior Segment OCT: The Chinese American Eye Study.","Regulation of cellular volume is an essential process to balance volume changes during cell proliferation and migration or when intracellular osmolality increases due to transepithelial transport. We previously characterized the key role of volume-regulated anion channels (VRAC) in the modulation of the volume of trabecular meshwork (TM) cells and, in turn, the aqueous humour (AH) outflow from the eye. The balance between the secretion and the drainage of AH determines the intraocular pressure (IOP) that is the major casual risk factor for glaucoma. Glaucoma is an ocular disease that causes irreversible blindness due to the degeneration of retinal ganglion cells. The recent identification of Leucine-Rich Repeat-Containing 8 (LRRC8A-E) proteins as the molecular components of VRAC opens the field to elucidate their function in the physiology of TM and glaucoma. Human TM cells derived from non-glaucomatous donors and from open-angle glaucoma patients were used to determine the expression and the functional activity of LRRC8-mediated channels. Expression levels of LRRC8A-E subunits were decreased in HTM glaucomatous cells compared to normotensive HTM cells. Consequently, the activity of VRAC currents and volume regulation of TM cells were significantly affected. Impaired cell volume regulation will likely contribute to altered aqueous outflow and intraocular pressure. "
The Effect of Compliance With Preoperative Posturing Advice and Head Movements on the Progression of Macula-On Retinal Detachment.,"To survey the opinion of oculoplastic surgeons on the assessment and management of lower eyelid retraction (LLR). A web-based survey queried oculoplastic surgeon members of Ojoplast, Spanish and Brazilian Oculoplastic Societies on the management of LLR. The frequency and percentage proportions of the responses were analyzed. One hundred ninety-six oculoplastic surgeons participated in the survey. The main cause of LLR is post-blepharoplasty (62;31.6%). The most used sign to detect LLR is scleral show. The most common approaches to managing LLR are lateral canthal surgery (164/593;27.6%), autogenous spacers (148/593; 24.9%) and retractor release (131/593;22.1%). The preferred autogenous graft material includes ear cartilage (102/260;39.2%). The majority of surgeons (161/314; 51.3%) recommend massage or steroids injection (80/314;25.5%) for early post-blepharoplasty LLR, while, 54.1% (106/196) of participants suggested waiting for at least six months prior to surgical intervention. Frost suture is used after most LLR surgeries (154/196;91.1%). Incomplete correction is the main complication (111/310;35.8%) of LLR surgery. For mild LLR, 48% of the responders prefer clinical treatment; conversely, severe cases routinely require combined surgical techniques. Oculoplastic surgeons frequently diagnose LLR based on scleral show. LLR management depends on the cause and severity of lid retraction. Mild cases, in general, receive clinical treatment and severe cases need a combination of surgical techniques and grafts. "
Differential Artery-Vein Analysis Improves the Performance of OCTA Staging of Sickle Cell Retinopathy.,"Intra-arterial chemotherapy (IAC) is now the first line treatment for selected patients with retinoblastoma (Rb). Typically, IAC is infused following the selective catheterization of the ophthalmic artery (OA) on the affected side. However, in some patients, the OA alone may not provide vascular supply to the tumor, whereas in other instances the efficacy of IAC could be compromised due to the presence of prominent collateral vessels from the external carotid artery (ECA). We report our experience with catheterizing vessels other than the OA for IAC treatment for Rb. After institutional review board approval, a retrospective analysis was conducted of electronic medical records and imaging of our Rb population. We identified 13 patients who received IAC for Rb treatment. Of these, five patients required alternative methods of chemotherapy delivery other than through the OA, totaling 17 treatments. Two patients needed balloon-assisted occlusion of the ECA, two patients required selective catheterization of the middle meningeal artery, and one patient had no internal carotid artery supply to the choroidal blush, thus the superficial temporal artery provided access for IAC. Total globe salvage rate was 76% and 80% with the alternative route subset. Alternatives to the OA may be necessary to deliver IAC for selected cases of Rb. These routes can be safe and effective. However, thorough understanding of the orbital blood supply is essential. Whether these alternative IAC methods result in similar outcomes to OA infusions has not been established. "
Antiphospholipid Antibodies Overlapping in Isolated Neurological Syndrome and Multiple Sclerosis: Neurobiological Insights and Diagnostic Challenges.,"Recent advances in corneal imaging have allowed for more objective diagnosis and disease monitoring, as well as provided valuable guidance for treatment progress. However, there has been limited literature providing comprehensive insight into advances across different imaging modalities. The aim of this review was to provide a brief summary of significant advances in the field of corneal imaging over the past 5 years. A literature search in PubMed was performed on December 11, 2018, using the following key words in various and/or logic combinations: ""cornea"", ""development"", ""advances"", ""topography"", ""Scheimpflug tomography"", ""ultra-high-speed Scheimpflug"", ""Corvis ST"", ""densitometry"", ""optical coherence tomography"", ""UHR-OCT"", and ""intraoperative OCT"". The initial search showed a total of 2910 articles. Filters were then applied to select original research studies on humans published in the last 5 years which are available in full text and written in English. A final 55 studies were included for analysis. This review looks into 5 key imaging modalities: topography, tomography, confocal microscopy, densitometry, and angiography. For each imaging modality, the underlying scientific principles and current applications are outlined. Existing limitations and potential future applications for each of them are also discussed in this review. Recent advances in the imaging modalities show immense potential in providing objective, high-resolution, and comprehensive visualization of corneal structures and pathologies. Application to different fields in the future is highly probable but technical, economic, and skill-based limitations must first be overcome. Any attempt to replace traditional imaging techniques with these newer techniques must also be supported with evidence from robust clinical studies. "
Tanycyte-Independent Control of Hypothalamic Leptin Signaling.,"The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the long-term incidence and timing of reactivation in patients with type 3 neovascularization who were treated with three monthly anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections. A total of 179 patients (179 eyes) diagnosed with type 3 neovascularization with dry macula after three monthly anti-VEGF loading injections were included in this retrospective study. After the initial treatment, patients were followed up without further injection until the first reactivation. The incidence and timing of the first reactivation after the initial treatment were recorded, and factors predictive of early reactivation (6months after the third anti-VEGF injection) were investigated. During a mean follow-up of 37.518.8months, the first reactivation was noted in 145 patients (81.0%) at a mean of 6.64.1months after the third injection. In 94 eyes (64.8%), reactivation was noted 2-6months after the third injection, while in 37 eyes (25.5%) it was noted 7-12months after the third injection. In the remaining 14 eyes (9.7%), the reactivation was noted after this period. The incidence of early reactivation was higher in women (P=0.014) and patients with thicker choroid (P=0.026). In patients with type 3 neovascularization, almost all reactivation was noted within 15months of the third anti-VEGF injection, suggesting the need for close follow-up and detailed examination during this period. Female patients with thick choroid should be monitored more frequently during this early period. "
Functional detection of botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A to F by monoclonal neoepitope-specific antibodies and suspension array technology.,"To evaluate the outcomes of patients undergoing pneumatic retinopexy (PR) performed by vitreoretinal fellows at 6 academic centers in the United States. Retrospective, multicenter, consecutive case series. 483 patients with primary retinal detachments who underwent PR by 49 vitreoretinal fellows from 6 U.S. training sites between 2002 and 2016. We reviewed medical records of patients and recorded baseline clinical characteristics (age, sex, baseline visual acuity, lens status, presence of lattice degeneration, presence of vitreous hemorrhage, location of retinal breaks, macular status, and size of detachment), visual and anatomic outcomes at 3-months after PR, as well as training level and PR experience of the fellow at the time of the procedure. Single-procedure anatomic success and visual acuity at 3-months follow-up, and association with clinical and training-related factors. Vitreoretinal fellows performed a variable number of PR, with a median of 7 cases per fellow (range 1-24). Single-procedure anatomic success was 66.8%, and mean LogMAR visual outcome was 0.43 (Snellen equivalent 20/54) at 3 months. Factors that were independently associated with single-procedure success include phakic lens status (P = 0.01), smaller size of retinal detachment (P = 0.02), and the fellow's procedure experience (P = 0.01). The only factor associated with worse visual outcome was baseline visual acuity (P < 0.001). Vitreoretinal fellows perform variably few pneumatic retinopexies but have outcomes comparable to reported rates by experienced specialists. Procedure experience of individual fellows may impact anatomic outcomes. "
Extracellular small non-coding RNA contaminants in fetal bovine serum and serum-free media.,"Familial retinal arteriolar tortuosity (FRAT) is a rare autosomal dominant disorder that is characterized by tortuosity of the second and higher order retinal arterioles. We implement swept-source optical coherence tomography angiography (SS-OCTA) to quantify vessel tortuosity in patients with FRAT. We hypothesize that patients with FRAT will have higher retinal arteriole tortuosity when compared to controls. Patients were scanned with a SS-OCTA device (Plex Elite 9000, Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA). Images of a 1212 mm<sup>2</sup> area centered on the fovea were processed, and retinal vessels >23.5m in diameter were identified. An automatic tortuosity measurement program written in MATLAB was used to assess vessel tortuosity. Branch points in the vessels were detected and used to separate the vasculature into individual segments. The tortuosity was measured by calculating the arc-chord ratio of each vessel segment, where a minimum value of 1 indicated a straight vessel and higher values corresponded to increasing tortuosity. Two patients (4 eyes) with a known history of FRAT and six controls (12 eyes) were enrolled in the study. The mean tortuosity of all vessel segments (MTVS) in scans of FRAT eyes was on average 1.1244 [range: 1.1044-1.1438] while for control eyes it was 1.0818 [range: 1.0746-1.0872]. Average MTVS of FRAT eyes was significantly higher compared to control eyes (p=0.03). Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that patients with FRAT have higher objective measurements of tortuosity compared to controls. Broader applications of this method may be of benefit in other retinal diseases with changes in retinal vessel configuration. "
Challenging case of unilateral mydriasis.,"Glaucoma disease progression, as measured by visual field (VF) data, is often defined by periods of relative stability followed by an abrupt decrease in visual ability at some point in time. Determining the transition point of the disease trajectory to a more severe state is important clinically for disease management and for avoiding irreversible vision loss. Based on this, we present a unified statistical modeling framework that permits prediction of the timing and spatial location of future vision loss and informs clinical decisions regarding disease progression. The developed method incorporates anatomical information to create a biologically plausible data-generating model. We accomplish this by introducing a spatially varying coefficients model that includes spatially varying change points to detect structural shifts in both the mean and variance process of VF data across both space and time. The VF location-specific change point represents the underlying, and potentially censored, timing of true change in disease trajectory while a multivariate spatial boundary detection structure is introduced that accounts for the complex spatial connectivity of the VF and optic disc. We show that our method improves estimation and prediction of multiple aspects of disease management in comparison to existing methods through simulation and real data application. The R package spCP implements the new methodology. "
Suboptimal T-cell Therapy Drives a Tumor Cell Mutator Phenotype That Promotes Escape from Frontline Treatment.,"Introduction The correlation between corneal curvature and central corneal thickness (CCT), with ocular parameters like axial length and refraction, remains elusive. The various ocular biometric parameters are interdependent and their correlation varies with the population studied. A comprehensive study is required for a better understanding of the ocular biometric properties of Indian eyes. Methodology This is a prospective study done in 156 subjects. Subjects with clear lens and clear cornea were included in the study. Those with corneal opacity, cataract, pregnancy,and diabetes were excluded. Cycloplegic refraction, autokeratometry (Potex, ultrasonic auto keratometer), central corneal thickness (ultrasonic pachymeter), and axial length (Sonomed) were done in all subjects. Subjects were divided into two groups based on refraction, for an analysis of parameters. Group one included subjects with refraction of +3 diopters (D) to -2.99D and group two with subjects with > -3D refraction. Results With anincreasing axial length and myopic refraction, the corneal curvature tends to be steeper. The average CCT of subjects in group one and group two were 530.34 microns and 542.63 microns, respectively. Subjects with refraction more than 10 diopters or axial length more than 25 mm had a mean CCT of 525.25 microns. Subjects with myopic refraction between 3 diopters and 10 diopters had a mean CCT of 551.32 microns. Conclusion Increase in corneal power is associated with increasing myopic refraction. Steeper corneal curvature is correlated with increasing axial length and thinner corneas. The mean CCT was 533.87 microns with a standard deviation (SD) of 40.02. Axial myopia is associated with an increase in corneal thickness. These ocular biometric findings have crucial implications in refractive surgeries. "
Genetic aspects of idiopathic paediatric uveitis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis associated uveitis in Chinese Han.,"Drug advertisement brochures (DABs) contain claims that are often supplemented by references in medical literature. Several studies have evaluated the DABs as they are commonly distributed by drug companies to practicing physicians. The objective of this study is to assess the consistency between the claims and references referred to in the DABs in Saudi Arabia. DABs were collected from medical practitioners in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Authors developed a protocol to be followed for quality assessment of the DABs. The vast majority of cited scientific papers were indexed in PubMed. Consequently, each reference was categorized as: justifiable, false, exaggerated or ambiguous. A total of 89 DABs were collected; 48 (53.9%) brochures were excluded from further analysis and the remaining 41 brochures(46.1%) contained 240 references with an approximate average of 5.9 references per DAB. A total of 201 cited papers were traced (83.8%). The majority of references (93.0%) supported the claims for which they were cited. However, 1.5%, 4.0% and 1.5% of claims were deemed inaccurate/false, exaggerated, and ambiguous, respectively. This study supports that the majority of the claims made in the DABs of pharmaceutical companies in Saudi Arabia were unreferenced. However, most of the evidence presented to substantiate claims made was considered true. "
Topographic correlation between macular superficial microvessel density and ganglion cell-inner plexiform layer thickness in glaucoma-suspect and early normal-tension glaucoma.,"Low patient compliance and poor bioavailability of ophthalmic medications are the main limitations of topical eye drops. A potential solution to these disadvantages could be provided by thermoresponsive hydrogels, which could be used as the basis for a gelling eye drop for long-term release of therapeutics. We previously reported such a system capable of being retained in the lower fornix of rabbits, continuously releasing an anti-glaucoma drug for one month. Here, we sought to improve the properties of the existing gels as most relevant to patient use without altering the drug release profile. Specifically, we optimized the sol-to-gel transition temperature and de-swelling kinetics of pNIPAAm gels to avoid risk of the gelled drop reverting to liquid during cold or windy weather, and ensure quick gelation upon administration. A reduction of the gel LCST, faster gelation kinetics, and suitable viscosity for the administration as an eye drop were successfully achieved through modification of the poly(ethylene glycol) content in the water phase and its molecular weight. Our data suggest that drug release is not affected by these changes, with representative drug concentration profiles of the previous and new formulations demonstrating comparable anti-glaucoma release kinetics.

Positive allosteric modulation of the type 1 cannabinoid receptor reduces the signs and symptoms of Huntington's disease in the R6/2 mouse model.,"Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the most common causes of blindness in developed countries. Due to its asymptomatic onset and progressive disease course, DR is typically diagnosed at a late stage when treatment options are limited and therefore often results in irreversible blindness. Studies have demonstrated that carnosine may prevent and treat DR. In a previous study, the positive effect of carnosine on DR was determined and it was revealed that there may be an association between carnosine and the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal related kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. To assess the interaction between carnosine and the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway, changes in PKC, ERK and p-ERK expression was assessed in diabetic rats following treatment with carnosine, PD98059 or U46619 via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting. The results demonstrated that the expression of ERK and p-ERK were significantly suppressed following treatment with carnosine, but no significant effect on the expression of PKC was identified, which indicates that suppressing the activation of the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway may serve an important role in carnosine-induced DR prevention and treatment.

A review of visual aftereffects in schizophrenia.,"Microglial cells are resident immune cells and play an important role in various cerebral and retinal inflammatory diseases. Notch1 signaling is involved in the microglia polarization and the control of cerebral inflammatory reactions. However, its role in endotoxin-induced uveitis (EIU) remains unknown. This study aimed to investigate the role of Notch1 signaling on retinal microglia polarization and inflammation in the cultured retinal microglial cells and EIU rat model. We found that Notch1 signaling blockade with N-[N-(3, 5-difluorophenacetyl)-1-alany1-S-phenyglycine t-butyl ester (DAPT) shifted retinal microglia phenotype from pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype (COX2<sup>+</sup> and iNOS<sup>+</sup>) to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotype (Arg-1<sup>+</sup>) and reduced the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines both <i>in vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i>. Moreover, DAPT treatment contributed to prevent retinal ganglion cells from apoptosis, reduce the intraocular infiltrating cells, and attenuate the impairment of retinal function. Taken together, these results suggest that inhibition of Notch1 signaling could alleviate the inflammatory response in EIU rat mainly through regulating the polarization of retinal microglia. Therefore, Notch1 signaling might be a promising therapeutic target in the treatment of ocular inflammatory diseases. "
Individualized penetrating keratoplasty using edge-trimmed glycerol-preserved donor corneas for perforated corneal ulcers.,"There is an increasing interest in identifying non-invasive biomarkers of disease severity and prognosis in idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD). Dopamine-transporter SPECT (DAT-SPECT), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) provide unique information about the brain's neurotransmitter and microstructural properties. In this study, we evaluate the relative and combined capability of these imaging modalities to predict symptom severity and clinical progression in <i>de novo</i> PD patients. To this end, we used MRI, SPECT, and clinical data of <i>de novo</i> drug-nave PD patients (<i>n</i> = 205, mean age 61  10) and age-, sex-matched healthy controls (<i>n</i> = 105, mean age 58  12) acquired at baseline. Moreover, we employed clinical data acquired at 1 year follow-up for PD patients with or without L-Dopa treatment in order to predict the progression symptoms severity. Voxel-based group comparisons and covariance analyses were applied to characterize baseline disease-related alterations for DAT-SPECT, DTI, and sMRI. Cortical and subcortical alterations in <i>de novo</i> PD patients were found in all evaluated imaging modalities, in line with previously reported midbrain-striato-cortical network alterations. The combination of these imaging alterations was reliably linked to clinical severity and disease progression at 1 year follow-up in this patient population, providing evidence for the potential use of these modalities as imaging biomarkers for disease severity and prognosis that can be integrated into clinical trials.

[Illustration Techniques in Ophthalmic Textbooks 200 Years Ago - a Platform for the Rostock Glass Eye Collection of Anterior Segment Pathologies from 1860].,"Sensory substitution is an effective means to rehabilitate many visual functions after visual impairment or blindness. Tactile information, for example, is particularly useful for functions such as reading, mental rotation, shape recognition, or exploration of space. Extant haptic technologies typically rely on real physical objects or pneumatically driven renderings and thus provide a limited library of stimuli to users. New developments in digital haptic technologies now make it possible to actively simulate an unprecedented range of tactile sensations. We provide a proof-of-concept for a new type of technology (hereafter haptic tablet) that renders haptic feedback by modulating the friction of a flat screen through ultrasonic vibrations of varying shapes to create the sensation of texture when the screen is actively explored. We reasoned that participants should be able to create mental representations of letters presented in normal and mirror-reversed haptic form without the use of any visual information and to manipulate such representations in a mental rotation task. Healthy sighted, blindfolded volunteers were trained to discriminate between two letters (either L and P, or F and G; counterbalanced across participants) on a haptic tablet. They then tactually explored all four letters in normal or mirror-reversed form at different rotations (0, 90, 180, and 270) and indicated letter form (i.e., normal or mirror-reversed) by pressing one of two mouse buttons. We observed the typical effect of rotation angle on object discrimination performance (i.e., greater deviation from 0 resulted in worse performance) for trained letters, consistent with mental rotation of these haptically-rendered objects. We likewise observed generally slower and less accurate performance with mirror-reversed compared to prototypically oriented stimuli. Our findings extend existing research in multisensory object recognition by indicating that a new technology simulating active haptic feedback can support the generation and spatial manipulation of mental representations of objects. Thus, such haptic tablets can offer a new avenue to mitigate visual impairments and train skills dependent on mental object-based representations and their spatial manipulation. "
Serial Z-plasty for Correction of Cicatricial Conjunctival Constriction Rings.,"Mechanical stress and hypoxia during episodes of ocular hypertension (OHT) trigger glial activation and neuroinflammation in the retina. Glial activation and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF and IL-1, complement, and other danger factors was shown to facilitate injury and loss of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that send visual information to the brain. However, cellular events linking neuroinflammation and neurotoxicity remain poorly characterized. Several pro-inflammatory and danger signaling pathways, including P2X7 receptors and Pannexin1 (Panx1) channels, are known to activate inflammasome caspases that proteolytically activate gasdermin D channel-formation to export IL-1 cytokines and/or induce pyroptosis. In this work, we used molecular and genetic approaches to map and characterize inflammasome complexes and detect pyroptosis in the OHT-injured retina. Acute activation of distinct inflammasome complexes containing NLRP1, NLRP3 and Aim2 sensor proteins was detected in RGCs, retinal astrocytes and Muller glia of the OHT-challenged retina. Inflammasome-mediated activation of caspases-1 and release of mature IL-1 were detected within 6 h and peaked at 12-24 h after OHT injury. These coincided with the induction of pyroptotic pore protein gasdermin D in neurons and glia in the ganglion cell layer (GCL) and inner nuclear layer (INL). The OHT-induced release of cytokines and RGC death were significantly decreased in the retinas of Casp1<sup>-/-</sup>Casp4(11)<sup>del</sup>, Panx1<sup>-/-</sup> and in Wild-type (WT) mice treated with the Panx1 inhibitor probenecid. Our results showed a complex spatio-temporal pattern of innate immune responses in the retina. Furthermore, they indicate an active contribution of neuronal NLRP1/NLRP3 inflammasomes and the pro-pyroptotic gasdermin D pathway to pathophysiology of the OHT injury. These results support the feasibility of inflammasome modulation for neuroprotection in OHT-injured retinas. "
Reply.,"Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the only output neurons that conduct visual signals from the eyes to the brain. RGC degeneration occurs in many retinal diseases leading to blindness and increasing evidence suggests that RGCs are susceptible to various injuries in a type-specific manner. Glutamate excitotoxicity is the pathological process by which neurons are damaged and killed by excessive stimulation of glutamate receptors and it plays a central role in the death of neurons in many CNS and retinal diseases. The purpose of this study is to characterize the susceptibility of genetically identified RGC types to the excitotoxicity induced by <i>N</i>-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA). We show that the susceptibility of different types of RGCs to NMDA excitotoxicity varies significantly, in which the RGCs are the most resistant type of RGCs to NMDA excitotoxicity while the J-RGCs are the most sensitive cells to NMDA excitotoxicity. These results strongly suggest that the differences in the genetic background of RGC types might provide valuable insights for understanding the selective susceptibility of RGCs to pathological insults and the development of a strategy to protect RGCs from death in disease conditions. In addition, our results show that RGCs lose dendrites before death and the sequence of the morphological and molecular events during RGC death suggests that the initial insult of NMDA excitotoxicity might set off a cascade of events independent of the primary insults. However, the kinetics of dendritic retraction in RGCs does not directly correlate to the susceptibility of type-specific RGC death. "
Management of Type 2 Bubble Formed During Big-Bubble Deep Anterior Lamellar Keratoplasty.,"We present a rare case of infected pyogenic conjunctival granuloma mimicking a conjunctival abscess as complication of strabismus surgery in a Saudi girl with exotropia. Despite administration of local antibiotics following strabismus surgery, a patient presented with localised redness and discharge after three weeks. The patient was afebrile with no signs of pre-septal or orbital cellulitis. After culture (<i>Staphylococcus aureus</i>) sensitivity testing the patient was prescribed oral Amoxicillin and Clavulanate and reviewed under general anaesthesia. A 55mm<sup>2</sup> conjunctival pyogenic granuloma was noted. A punch biopsy specimen indicated inflammatory and histiocytic cells. The addition of steroid to the medical therapy resulted in a quiet eye after three weeks. "
"Influence of reversal of neuromuscular blockade with sugammadex or neostigmine on postoperative quality of recovery following a single bolus dose of rocuronium: A prospective, randomized, double-blinded, controlled study.","Unwanted hair is an important aesthetic problem in many cultures. Laser epilation devices have become commonly available at the present time. Nowadays, laser hair removal is widely practiced as a cosmetic procedure, however, some ocular complications may occur. The retina is the most vulnerable to laser-related injury which can lead to serious visual impairment. Laser epilation can cause serious complications and medical costs if not performed carefully and appropriately. The use of laser hair removal devices by unskilled aestheticians who is untrained and do not have the proper protective equipment at the beauty centers, can cause serious ophthalmological and psychological disorders and thus substantial labour productivity loss and economic loss. Therefore, the protective eyewear must be used by both the aesthetician and the patient during the procedure of laser epilation. In this way, we can improve the safety of both patients and aestheticians and at the same time ensure their healths. I reported the case of a 49-year-old female with a unilateral maculopathy responsible for an acute visual field defect and consecutive psychological depression secondary to Alexandrite laser epilation. This report is important to raise the awareness of ophthalmology and dermatology society and public about risks of their misuse. "
The levels and significance of inflammasomes in the mouse retina following optic nerve crush.,A patient with an anophthalmic socket with a dermis-fat graft (DFG) developed inflammation and a foul odour in the right socket. The DFG was surgically removed and Tungiasis infestation was detected. This is the first case to report Tungiasis infestation in a DFG in an anophthalmic socket. 
Parafoveal vessel loss and correlation between peripapillary vessel density and cognitive performance in amnestic mild cognitive impairment and early Alzheimer's Disease on optical coherence tomography angiography.,"We report a case of nonpainful uveitis nine months after an uncomplicated phacoemulsification cataract surgery. Chronic postoperative endophthalmitis was suspected. Diagnostic vitrectomy and partial capsular bag removal was performed, but the specimens cultured in microbiology laboratory showed no pathogens. Systemic workup came positive for skin Tuberculosis test, and presumed intraocular tuberculosis treatment was started accordingly. Inflammation persisted, so a repeat vitrectomy was performed with removal of the lens implant with the capsule, and this time bedside culture inoculation was performed in operating room, revealing <i>Pseudomonas</i> infection. Delayed-onset postoperative endophthalmitis typically progresses slowly and therefore can be confused with uveitis and treated with steroid and immunosuppressant treatment regimes. Our case confirms both the value of immediate bacterial inoculation and the necessity of aggressive surgical treatment in chronic postoperative endophthalmitis cases. "
Foveal structure and vasculature in eyes with idiopathic epiretinal membrane.,"Hemorrhagic occlusive retinal vasculitis (HORV) is a condition associated with intraocular vancomycin during surgical intervention, most frequently following bilateral sequential cataract surgery. Because of the high rate of ophthalmic vascular complications in this condition, gonioscopic evaluation for identification of neovascularization of the angle and iris is essential. Careful examination can reveal previously asymptomatic and unassociated lesions of the iris or ciliary body. We present the case of a 71-year-old female who was diagnosed with a ciliary body melanoma secondary to complete ophthalmic examination associated with HORV. She reported decreased vision to light perception in the left eye (OS) following sequential, bilateral cataract surgery. Fundus examination OS demonstrated diffuse retinal vasculitis, retinal ischemia, and extensive hemorrhage. Evaluation included inflammatory and coagulopathy laboratory evaluation, carotid ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain and orbits, all of which proved unrevealing, except for an enhancing mass OS on MRI. Further evaluation revealed a pigmented mass with features of melanoma in the anterior chamber angle extending into the ciliary body. Fine needle aspiration biopsy revealed high risk cytogenetic characteristics, and plaque radiotherapy was successfully employed. "
Prevalence and Phenotypes of Age-Related Macular Degeneration in Eyes With High Myopia.,"Primary vitreoretinal lymphoma (PVRL) is a rare ocular lymphoid malignancy, which consists a subset of primary central system lymphoma (PCNSL) and the most common type of intraocular lymphoma. The involvement of eyes is estimated to be approximately 20% of PCNSL, but the brain involvement may be up to 80% of PVRL. Typically, PVRL is a high grade B-cell malignancy of the retina and needs to be assorted from choroidal low-grade B-cell lymphomas. Very often PVRL masquerades and can be erroneously diagnosed as chronic uveitis, white dot syndromes or other neoplasms. Establishing an accurate diagnosis may involve cytology/pathology, immunohistochemistry, flow cytometry, molecular pathology and cytokine profile analysis. There is inadequate information about PVRL's true incidence, ethnic/geographical variation and pathogenetic mechanisms. The therapeutic approach of PVRL involves aggressive chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Although PVRL tends to have a good response to the initial treatment, the prognosis is poor and the survival restricted due to the high relapse rates and CNS involvement. "
Quantification of Visual Fixation in Multiple Sclerosis.,"To report anatomical and visual outcomes of Nd:YAG laser posterior hyaloidotomy (NYPH) in Saudi patients affected by Premacular subhyaloid haemorrhage (PMSHH). 8 eyes from 8 patients (7 males and one female) were treated with NYPH when no spontaneous resolution of PMSHH was noticed. The cause of PMSHH was proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) in 3 cases, Central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO) in 2 cases, Valsalva retinopathy in 2 cases, and laser pointer injury in one case. The YAG laser was delivered using a Q switched mode and 3 mirrors contact lens. One attempt of laser delivery was enough in 6 cases and 2 cases needed 2 attempts. The laser power needed ranged between 2 and 4mJ. Anatomical success was achieved in all cases. The mean LogMAR VA improved from 1.5 before treatment to 0.3 post-treatment. The difference is statistically significant (<i>p</i>=0.012). No complications related to Nd:YAG laser therapy was reported in any of the study cases until the last follow up. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report the outcomes of NYPH for non-resolving PMSHH in Saudi cases. In this small cases series, the procedure seems to be safe, effective, simple, cheap, and non-invasive treatment modality for this disorder that is conducted in the outpatient setting. We think it should be considered as a first option for cases of SHH covering the fovea due to various aetiologies. "
Behaviors Associated with Internet Use in Military Medical Students and Residents.,"To compare the efficacy of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) added the infusion fluid with a control group in the event of grade C PVR in recurrent retinal detachment (RD). The records of the patients with recurrent retinal detachment with grade C PVR who underwent vitrectomy for retinal detachment surgery between April 2003 and October 2004 were reviewed retrospectively for this comparative study. The recurrent retinal detachment patients with grade C PVR who underwent vitrectomy and had a minimum post-operative follow-up period of 12months were included. The patients were divided into two groups as study and control groups. 5-FU (200 microgram/ml) and low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) (5IU/ml) was added into the infusion solution of the study group. Primary outcome measure of this study was the single operation anatomical success at month 12. A total of 43 eyes of 43 patients were included. The control group was consisted of 26 eyes (60.5%) and the 5-FU group was consisted of 17 eyes (39.5%). At month 12, single operation anatomical success was obtained in 14 of the 26 patients (53.8%) in the control group and in 16 of the 17 patients (94.1%) in the 5-FU group (p=0.005). Favorable outcomes were obtained in the patients with recurrent RD and grade C PVR in whom 5-FU and LMWH added infusion fluid which was used during vitrectomy. "
A Small Bite on the Eyelid,"To report the initial misdiagnosis of patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease. The medical records of 76 consecutive patients diagnosed with VKH disease were reviewed retrospectively at The Eye Center, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Patients were referred to The Eye Center from Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries. The initial diagnosis was made by an ophthalmologist or neurologist. The main outcome measure was to evaluate cases with VKH disease who were initially misdiagnosed. In 7 (9.2%) out of the 76 patients the initial diagnosis was incorrect. Patients were initially misdiagnosed as optic neuritis (1.3%), intracranial hypertension (1.3%), brain tumor (1.3%), Susac disease (1.3%), migraine (1.3%), rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (1.3%) or anterior granulomatous uveitis of unknown etiology (1.3%). Patients underwent unnecessary tests including MRI and invasive procedures including CSF analysis and anterior chamber paracentesis. The initial diagnosis of patients with VKH disease was incorrect in 9 % of the cases. Delay in the diagnosis of VKH disease may lead to delay in management and may cause irreversible damage to the photoreceptors with poor visual outcome. "
Cannabidiol as adjunctive treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome and Dravet syndrome.,"To report a critical case series of six patients with posterior microphthalmos (PM). Complete ophthalmologic examinations of all patients were performed using best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), cycloplegic refraction, applanation tonometry, slit lamp biomicroscopy of the anterior segment, fundoscopy, A and B mode ultrasonography (USG), keratometry, and optic coherence tomography (OCT). The most significant clinical characteristics of male patients aged 10-25years was the presence of shorter posterior segments (mean: 15.27-18.91mm) accompanying high hyperopia (mean +9.00 - +18.50 diopter) despite the normal anterior segment findings. The BCVA ranged between 20/320 and 40/100. Retinal folds were detected bilaterally on the papillomacular band in all patients. Although neurosensory retina was included in the fold in OCT images, retinal pigment epithelium, choroid, and sclera were not included in the fold. Pigmentary retinopathy was detected in one patient. Despite normal anterior segment, posterior microphthalmos is characterized with high hyperopia, and shorter axial length and bilateral papillomacular retinal fold. Refractive amblyopia, uveal effusion syndrome, retinal detachment and macular hole are complications that can be corrected. Posterior microphthalmos must be kept in mind in patients with a normal anterior segment, and high hyperopia. "
Interleukin-6 plays a crucial role in the development of subretinal fibrosis in a mouse model.,"The objectives of the study were to identify the incidence and pattern of dry eye after phacoemulsification and manual small incision cataract surgeries. The study consisted of two groups of patients - Group 1 underwent manual small incision cataract surgery (SICS) and Group 2 underwent phacoemulsification. The dry eye-related data was collected preoperatively and at 1week, 1month and 3months postoperatively. Ocular Surface Disease Index questionnaire, tear break-up time (TBUT) and Schirmer test - 1 were used to record the type of dry eye. One hundred eyes of 96 patients, including 35 (36.5%) men and 61 (63.5%) women with the mean age of 63.1 (8.3) years were studied. Dry eyes were found in 42% eyes (p<0.001) of patients at 1week follow-up. Fifteen percent and 9% of the eyes were dry at 1month and 3months after surgery, respectively. There were 34 (53.1%) and 8 (22.2%) dry eyes in SICS and phacoemulsification groups, respectively at one week postoperative follow-up which was a statistically significant difference.Majority of eyes (27/42, 64.3%) had mild dryness. There were significant differences in TBUT at 1week, 1month and 3months postoperatively. At 1week review, the SICS group had mean TUBT of 10.0 (0.55) sec as compared to 13.9 (0.70) sec in phacoemulsification group (p<0.001). Incidence of dry eye is higher in SICS than phacoemulsification due to tear film instability. The clinicians should be conscious about dry eye symptoms and signs in an otherwise healthy eye after cataract surgery. "
Early results of micropulse transscleral cyclophotocoagulation for the treatment of glaucoma.,"Degenerative biomechanical factors and immunologic processes with effect on collagen and corneal reparative process are known as the main cause of ocular surface dysfunction in mustard gas keratopathy (MGK) and may cause changes in the corneal biomechanical values. Therefore, we evaluate corneal biomechanical properties of these patients. This case-control study includes 61 chemical warfare victims with MGK. After omission according to our exclusion criteria, 88 eyes of patients with MGK were enrolled as the case group and also a group of 88 normal eyes, which were matched regarding their age and sex in the control group, were enrolled. Measurements of corneal biomechanical properties which reported by ORA and Corvis ST (CST) devices were compared. The SPSS software version 23.0 was used in the statistical analysis. For comparisons between groups, if the data had a normal distribution, were analyzed by Student's <i>t</i>-test and ANOVA, and if the data didn't have a normal distribution, Mann-Whitney U test, and Kruskal-Wallis were used. Furthermore, to identify a relationship between two groups of data Spearman's rank Correlation test was used. <i>P</i> value<0.05 were considered statistically significant. In the MGK group, A1 length (A1L), A1 velocity (A1V), A2 velocity (A2V), deformation amplitude (DA) and peak distance (PD) were higher than the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). However, the corneal hysteresis (CH) (<i>P</i>=0.003), corneal resistant factor (CRF), non-corrected IOP (IOPnct), corrected IOP based on corneal thickness (IOPpachy), and central corneal thickness (CCT) were lower than the control group (<i>P</i><0.001). The visual acuity according to the LogMAR scale and severity of MGK was positively associated with IOPpachy and negatively associated with CH, CRF, CCT and highest concavity radius (Radius). Measurement of corneal biomechanical properties may be, have a useful role in the classification, monitoring or diagnosis of MGK. "
Ocular bleeding in an undiagnosed hemophiliac neonate causing irreversible loss of vision: A case report with review of the literature.,"Trypan Blue is an acid azo dye commonly used as a stain to distinguish viable from non-viable cells. It is a vital stain used intra operatively during cataract surgery to stain the external surface of the anterior lens capsule for better visualization. To analyze the histomorphological effects of trypan blue on Lens Epithelial cells and the Basement Membrane on direct exposure by staining the internal surface of the anterior lens capsule during Small Incision Cataract Surgery. Analytical cross sectional case control study. Anterior capsule specimens of 14 Patients undergoing small incision cataract surgery at Department of Ophthalmology, Govt Medical College Hospital, Thrissur were studied. Two specimens of anterior capsule taken from the same eye form the case and control. Control specimen <b>(sample A)</b> was removed first, after the routine <i>external</i> staining with trypan blue 0.06% (w/v) for 10 seconds. The stain was washed off by balanced salt solution in every case. Then trypan blue was injected under the remaining anterior capsule and case (Test) specimen (<b>sample B)</b> was obtained after direct contact of trypan blue to the internal surface (lens epithelial cells) for 1 minute. Histomorphological (qualitative and quantitative) examination of both specimens done. <b>Qualitative data</b> analysis was done by EPI INFO software.<i>v.</i>7. Intactness of LECs throughout the length was statistically significant in Sample A (<i>p</i>=0.000027). Partial and complete detachment of Lens Epithelial Cells, degeneration, and nuclear smudging were significantly higher in Sample B. Qualitative analysis of the basement membrane showed significant edema of the basement membrane in sample B. Basement membrane splitting observed in sample B was not statistically significant. <b>Quantitative data</b> analyzed using independent <i>t</i> test. There was a statistically significant decrease in cell density in sample B with <i>p</i> value less than 0.05. Our study demonstrated that direct staining of the internal surface of anterior capsule with trypan blue affected LECs and the basement membrane. There were reduction in cell density, irreversible degeneration of Lens Epithelial Cells and basement membrane edema. Hence treating the internal surface of capsular bag with trypan blue may reduce incidence of Posterior capsular opacification. "
TGF 1 ACTIVATED TYPE 2 DENDRITIC CELLS PROMOTE WOUND HEALING AND INDUCE FIBROBLASTS TO EXPRESS TENASCIN C FOLLOWING CORNEAL FULL-THICKNESS HYDROGEL TRANSPLANTATION.,"To compare the effectiveness of femtosecond laser (FSL) assisted and manual arcuate keratotomy (AK) procedures for the correction of postkeratoplasty astigmatism. Fifty-two eyes (52 patients) were treated with FSL assisted AK and 53 eyes (51 patients) with manual AK for post-keratoplasty astigmatism. The main outcome measures included preoperative and postoperative manifest refraction, uncorrected and corrected distance visual acuity (UDVA, CDVA), corneal topography and complications. In FSL group, UDVA changed significantly from 0.900.43 preoperatively to 0.600.39 at last follow-up (p=0.001). In manual group, preop- (0.870.35) and post-operative UDVA (0.93042) were comparable (p=0.535). CDVA improved from 0.300.18 preoperatively to 0.200.14 at last follow-up visit in FSL group (0.014) and 0.280.15 preoperative to 0.230.19 at last postoperative visit (0.074) in manual group. Postoperative UDVA and CDVA were comparable between both the groups (p>0.05). The mean preoperative refractive cylinder was 6.383.73 and 7.15132, decreasing significantly to 5.062.06 and 5.192.25 after manual and FSL assisted AK procedures respectively. Mean change in the refractive cylinder was -1.104.11 in manual AK group and -2.192.35 in FSL group (p=0.134). Perforation, overcorrection and regression occurred in respectively 3 eyes (5.8%), 12 eyes (23.07%) and 1 eye (1.92%) in FSL group and 1 eye (1.9%; macro-perforation), 7 eyes (13.21%) and 8 eyes (15.09%) in manual group. Additionally, in the manual group, severe ectasia occurred in 1 eye (1.9%). FSL assisted AK procedure is comparable or to a certain extent better regarding safety and efficacy than manual AK procedure. Postoperatively, FSL resulted in better outcomes of UCVA, BCVA, refractive cylinder and keratometric astigmatism compared to the manual AK procedures; although, the difference between the groups was not statistically significant.

Two different initial treatment regimens of ranibizumab in myopic choroidal neovascularization: 12-Month results from a randomized controlled study-Response.,"The main purpose of the study was to examine and identify factors that influence the future practice pattern of Saudi Board of Ophthalmology residents as well as their academic goals. This study also aimed to compare the plans and career goals of the current Saudi ophthalmology residents with a former cohort of Saudi ophthalmology residents. All current residents of Saudi Board of Ophthalmology were invited to complete an anonymous online survey in March 2017. Residents were contacted by email. The survey contained questions on demographics, plans and factors influencing career choice of the residents in their future. Data were categorized by gender. Chi-square was used to assess the effect of gender on outcomes where appropriate. Of 150 residents surveyed, 91 (61%) responded to the survey. Having the ability to combine medicine and surgery was the most motivating factor for pursuing an ophthalmology residency training program (81% of respondents). Most residents expressed an interest in providing refractive surgery (62%), being involved in research activities (85%) and working part-time in the private sector (73%). The majority (81%) expressed a desire to practice in an urban setting as well as pursuing fellowship training (81%). Anterior segment (31%) and surgical retina (15%) were the most popular choices for fellowship training. Increasing interest in joining fellowship training programs (mostly in surgical subspecialties) and being involved in research activities among current generation of ophthalmology residents have been observed compared to a previous cohort study in the same country.

New therapies in development for the management of non-infectious uveitis: a review.,"Endogenous endophthalmitis is a rare complication of acute meningitis. A healthy 82-year-old woman suddenly developed septic bacteremia and meningitis owing to Staphylococcus aureus (methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus); she presented with a high fever and drowsiness. Improvement of these initial symptoms unveiled impaired bilateral visual acuity. Detailed ophthalmological assessments diagnosed it as probable endogenous endophthalmitis, which was immediately treated with vitrectomy. Subsequently, the patient totally recovered without any neurologic or ophthalmic sequela. "
Pericytes in the Retina.,"To report a case of retinal necrosis after Depo-Medrol<sup>TM</sup> injection during complicated cataract surgery. Interventional case report. A PubMed search was conducted using the search terms ""methylprednisolone acetate"" and ""intraocular"" as well as ""methylprednisolone acetate"" and ""cataract surgery."" All articles retrieved by this method were reviewed. A 68-year-old man complained of vision loss in the left eye immediately following cataract surgery. At presentation, his vision was count fingers. Fundus exam, fluorescein angiography, and autofluorescence imaging all confirmed retinal necrosis in the macula. Review of the operative note revealed cataract surgery complicated by a posterior capsule tear. Depo-Medrol<sup>TM</sup> was injected into the anterior chamber to visualize prolapsed vitreous prior to performing an anterior vitrectomy. Intraocular Depo-Medrol<sup>TM</sup> injection is a preventable, devastating cause of retinal necrosis and blindness with very similar packaging and appearance to triamcinolone acetonide. Awareness of its retinal toxicity should be more widely known by both anterior and posterior segment surgeons to avoid iatrogenic vision loss. "
Serum and aqueous humor vitamin D levels in patients with diabetic macular edema.,"The periocular space is a promising alternative route for the delivery of drugs to the posterior eye segment, especially when treating conditions in the outer ocular layers. In this review, we discuss the different periocular routes as well as the physiological barriers and elimination mechanisms limiting drug bioavailability at the back of the eye. We then highlight various types of depot formulation, including particulate delivery systems, semisolid formulations, and implants, used to increase the contact time with the ocular tissues. With the additional advantage of sustaining drug release, such depot formulations could enhance periocular drug delivery to the posterior eye segment. "
Early detection of cone photoreceptor cell loss in retinitis pigmentosa using adaptive optics scanning laser ophthalmoscopy.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily affects the brain and is the most common form of dementia worldwide. Despite more than a century of research, there are still no early biomarkers for AD. It has been reported that AD affects the eye, which is more accessible for imaging than the brain; however, links with the cornea have not been evaluated. To investigate whether the cornea could be used to identify possible diagnostic indicators of AD, we analyzed the proteolytic processing and isoforms of amyloid precursor protein (APP) and evaluated the expression of AD-related genes and proteins in corneal fibroblasts from wild-type (WT) corneas and corneas from patients with granular corneal dystrophy type 2 (GCD2), which is related to amyloid formation in the cornea. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis was used to assess the expression of AD-related genes, i.e., APP, ADAM10, BACE1, BACE2, PSEN1, NCSTN, IDE, and NEP. RT-PCR and DNA sequencing analysis demonstrated that isoforms of APP770 and APP751, but not APP695, were expressed in corneal fibroblasts. Moreover, the mRNA ratio of APP770/APP751 isoforms was approximately 4:1. Western blot analysis also demonstrated the expression of a disintegrin and metalloprotease domain-containing protein 10 (ADAM10), beta-site APP-cleaving enzyme 1 (BACE1), nicastrin, insulin degradation enzyme, and neprilysin in corneal fibroblasts. Among these targets, the levels of immature ADAM10 and BACE1 protein were significantly increased in GCD2 cells. The expression levels of APP, ADAM10, BACE1, and transforming growth factor-beta-induced protein (TGFBIp) were also detected by western blot in human corneal epithelium. We also investigated the effects of inhibition of the autophagy-lysosomal and ubiquitin-proteasomal proteolytic systems (UPS) on APP processing and metabolism. These pathway inhibitors accumulated APP, -carboxy-terminal fragments (CTFs), -CTFs, and the C-terminal APP intracellular domain (AICD) in corneal fibroblasts. Analysis of microRNAs (miRNAs) revealed that miR-9 and miR-181a negatively coregulated BACE1 and TGFBIp, which was directly associated with the pathogenesis of AD and GCD2, respectively. Immunohistochemical analysis indicated that APP and BACE1 were distributed in corneal stroma cells, epithelial cells, and the retinal layer in mice. Collectively, we propose that the cornea, which is the transparent outermost layer of the eye and thus offers easy accessibility, could be used as a potential biomarker for AD diagnosis and progression.

Disease-associated mutations of claudin-19 disrupt retinal neurogenesis and visual function.,"Lacrycon<sup></sup> is a preservative-free hypotonic artificial tear for the treatment of dry eye syndrome containing hyaluronic acid, carbomer, and glycerol. Lacrycon has been used for many years; this is the first comprehensive review of clinical efficacy and tolerability. Eight clinical studies (1992-2013) were reviewed. Comparators included phosphate-buffered saline (Phase I) and active controls (Phase II: Lacrisol; Phase III: Gel-larmes, Lacrisol, Hyalistil<sup></sup>, Vismed<sup></sup>, or the currently prescribed tear substitute). Administration schedules varied from 3 to 8 instillations per day for 7 to 84 days, and evaluation timepoints varied between studies. Pre-corneal retention of Lacrycon was 22% better than phosphate-buffered saline in terms of AUC (P=0.048). Patients' evaluation of efficacy was better for Lacrycon than Gel-larmes on Day 15 and 45 (P<0.05) and similar on Day 90 (P>0.05); there was no difference (P>0.05) versus Hyalistil (Day 30) or Vismed (Day 35 and 85). Functional tests were either in favor of Lacrycon (P<0.05) (fluorescein test [versus Gel-larmes/Lacrisol/Hyalistil], tear break-up time [TBUT] and rose Bengal test, Schirmer I test, and tear meniscus [versus Lacrisol]), or there was no difference between treatments (P>0.05) (fluorescein test [versus Vismed], TBUT and rose Bengal test [versus Gel-larmes], Schirmer I test [versus Gel-larmes/Lacrisol/Hyalistil/VisMed], tear meniscus [versus Lacrisol/Hyalistil], Oxford Grading Score, OSDI, van Bijsterveld score, and conjunctival hyperemia [versus Vismed]). Lacrycon was better tolerated than most comparators and had a similar safety profile to Vismed. No comparison showed favored the comparator over Lacrycon. These good efficacy, tolerability and safety data support the use of Lacrycon in dry eye syndrome. "
Dysfunction of the ubiquitin ligase E3A Ube3A/E6-AP contributes to synaptic pathology in Alzheimer's disease.,"Eyes and kidneys have numerous structural, developmental, physiologic, and pathogenic pathways in common, suggesting that many kidney and eye diseases may be interlinked. Studies suggest that the prevalence of eye diseases and vision impairment are higher among persons with end-stage kidney disease and earlier stages of chronic kidney disease (CKD) than in those without. Ocular morbidity inpersons with CKD and end-stage kidney disease may be due to the following risk factors: (1) underlyingconditions and risk factors for CKD such as diabetes or hypertension, (2) metabolic disorders associated with CKD, (3) uremia and anemia, and (4) CKD treatment. Among the chief eye diseases, diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration are most consistently associated with CKD. Further research for eye diseases such as glaucoma and cataract is needed to determine their relationships with CKD. Despite the high prevalence and burden of vision impairment among persons with CKD, eye screening in patients with CKD is not currently recommended as standard practice. This review suggests that patients with CKD should be encouraged to undergo a complete eye examination. Furthermore, physicians should be aware that patients undergoing dialysis may develop acute eye problems such as acute glaucoma, and appropriate referral to ophthalmologists should be considered in those with a history of glaucoma or recent ocular surgery. Interdisciplinary collaboration between nephrologists and ophthalmologists will ensure enhanced and appropriate management of patients with CKD. "
Carbon Nanomaterials for Energy and Biorelated Catalysis: Recent Advances and Looking Forward.,"To assess the associations and predictive value of spectral-domain (SD) OCT inner and outer retinal structural parameters and visual acuity (VA) outcomes in macular edema (ME) secondary to central retinal vein occlusion (CRVO). Retrospective, longitudinal cohort study. Eighty-four patients with ME secondary to CRVO receiving pro re nata anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy at 3 tertiary-level retina referral centers. In all participants, VA, demographic and clinical parameters, and SD OCT images from baseline, 3 months, and 12 months were reviewed. Spectral-domain OCT-based morphologic features in the 1500-m foveal zone were analyzed by masked graders for disorganization of the retinal inner layers (DRIL), ellipsoid zone (EZ) and external limiting membrane disruption, cone outer segment tip (COST) visibility, cysts, subretinal and intraretinal fluid, and epiretinal membranes. Spectral-domain OCT-based retinal structural parameters and VA outcomes. In multivariate analyses adjusting for baseline VA, worsening VA over 1 year was associated with 1-year increases in DRIL (point estimate, 0.06 per 100 m; P < 0.001) and EZ disruption (0.07 per 100 m; P= 0.023), but decreased COST visibility (-0.09 per 100 m; P= 0.018). A 3-month increase in DRIL (0.05 per 100 m; P= 0.003) and EZ disruption (0.10 per 100 m; P < 0.001) were the only factors predicting VA worsening over 1 year, after controlling for baseline VA. A multivariate model including 3-month evolution in DRIL, EZ disruption, and VA accounted for 86.3% of variability in 1-year VA change. Absolute differences between predicted and actual 1-year VA were within 2 lines in 80.9%. When DRIL increased by 250 m or more over 3 months, no eyes showed VA improvement of 1 line or more in 1 year. When EZ disruption decreased by 250 m or more over 3 months, no eyes worsened by 1 line or more over 1 year. Early recovery over 3 months in both DRIL and EZ parameters are key drivers of 1-year VA outcomes. Predictive models incorporating 3-month changes in DRIL and EZ disruption support their usefulness as potential robust determinants of future VA. "
Bone Age Practices in Infants and Older Children among Practicing Radiologists in Pakistan: Developing World Perspective.,"To assess the long-term comparative effectiveness of ranibizumab versus switching to aflibercept in neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD). A 24-month, retrospective, comparative, nonrandomized, matched cohort study. Patients with nAMD initiated on ranibizumab who remained (nonswitchers) or who switched to aflibercept (switchers) captured from a United States electronic medical records database between July 1, 2011 and October 12,2014. Patient eyes were matched for baseline age, baseline visual acuity (VA), VA at month 3, and duration of follow-up. Matching ratio was 1:2 (switchers: nonswitchers) where possible and 1:1 otherwise. The primary outcome was VA change from baseline (first injection of ranibizumab) to month 24. Secondary end points were standardized area under the curve of VA change; patient eyes (%) gaining or losing 5, 10, or 15 letters, or with VA of >73 letters at month 24; number of injections and monitoring visits; and analysis of preswitch characteristics. A total of 454 switchers and 750 matched nonswitchers were included. The adjusted difference in mean VA change from baseline to month 24 for switchers to nonswitchers was 0.02 letters (95% confidence interval [CI], -1.63 to 1.68). The upper bound 95% CI (1.68) was below the predefined noninferiority margin of 5letters. Switchers had a significantly higher annualized number of mean total visits compared with nonswitchers (10.0 vs. 9.0 for year 1; 8.7 vs. 7.4 for year 2), a higher number of injection visits (8.4 vs. 6.7 for year 1; 7.0 vs. 5.1 for year 2), but a lower number of monitoring-only visits (1.6 vs. 2.3 for year 1; 1.7 vs. 2.3 for year 2). During the preswitch period, switchers had a higher number of injection visits (7.6 vs. 6.5), fewer monitoring-only visits (1.5 vs. 2.2), and comparable total visits (9.1 vs. 8.7). Visual acuity change from baseline to switch was similar between switchers and nonswitchers (adjusted least squares mean difference, -1.36 letters; 95% CI, -2.76 to 0.05). Switching patients from ranibizumab to aflibercept resulted in no difference in VA change compared with those maintained on ranibizumab only. The lower retreatment rate in nonswitchers compared with switchers post switch does not support the view of a longer treatment efficacy. "
Latent Sensitization in a Mouse Model of Ocular Neuropathic Pain.,"To describe the characteristics and outcomes of endogenous endophthalmitis. Retrospective case series. Patients with endogenous endophthalmitis. A retrospective chart review of patients diagnosed with endogenous endophthalmitis between September 1, 2006, and November 1,2014. Clinical findings, treatments, microbial results, visual outcomes, and secondary ocular sequelae. Sixty-three patients (68 eyes) were diagnosed with endogenous endophthalmitis. Ocular symptoms were the first manifestation of disease in 76% of patients. Fungal and bacterial endophthalmitis were seen in 37% (n= 25) and 43% (n= 29) of eyes, respectively. In 47% of eyes (n= 32), the disease was associated with intravenous drug use. Eighteen percent of eyes (n= 12) underwent an initial pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with intravitreal antibiotics, none of which required a secondary intervention for acute infection. Four percent of eyes (n= 3) received only systemic treatment. Seventy-eight percent of eyes (n= 53) underwent initial bedside aspirate with intravitreal injection of antibiotics (tap-and-injection), of which 55% (n= 29) required a secondary PPV. Of eyes that underwent secondary PPV after initially negative culture results from the tap-and-injection, 52% demonstrated positive culture results at the time of secondary PPV (n= 11/21) despite all but 1 having received appropriate antimicrobial coverage initially. Fifty-four percent of eyes (n= 37) experienced secondary ocular sequelae. Eyes that received initial tap-and-injection had statistically nonsignificant better average initial vision, but worse average vision at each follow-up interval, compared to PPV while being less likely to gain 2 lines or more of vision at every follow-up interval except 6 months, with the difference reaching statistical significance at 1 week (odds ratio = 0.014; P= 0.037). Eyes that underwent initial tap-and-injection were statistically significantly more likely to require a secondary PPV (55% vs. 0%; P= 0.0006) and had fewer positive microbial results (19% vs. 67%) than those that underwent initial PPV (P= 0.002). Most eyes that received initial tap-and-injection eventually underwent a secondary PPV. Initial PPV may have an important role in management because it was associated with better diagnostic yield and a trend toward better visual outcomes. "
Cytomegalovirus Retinitis Associated with Lenalidomide Use for Multiple Myeloma in an Immunocompetent Patient.,"To describe the clinical impact of subfoveal lucency (SFL) seen on OCT before and after treatment of vitreomacular traction (VMT) or symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion (VMA) without macular hole (MH) in the prospective phase 3 trials of ocriplasmin vitreolysis. Randomized double-blind placebo-controlled multicenter study. Four hundred ninety-nine eyes with VMT or VMA without MH. Eyes were randomized to either a single intravitreal injection of ocriplasmin or placebo treatment and were followed up for 6 months. Eyes were analyzed for presence, dimensions, and course of SFL on OCT, release of VMT, and their effect on visual acuity (VA). Among eyes without baseline SFL, new SFL was more frequent after ocriplasmin than placebo at week 1 (23.1% vs. 6.54%; P= 0.0002) and week 2 (19.7% vs. 3.85%; P= 0.0001), but was similar in frequency by week 4 (8.37% vs. 7.69%; P= 0.83). Six-month VA for eyes demonstrating SFL after ocriplasmin during the first 2 weeks was comparable with those without SFL at any point in the study (P= 0.12). In placebo-treated eyes but not ocriplasmin-treated eyes, SFL was associated with worse VA at all visits. The increase in SFL width from baseline to week 2 was significantly greater with ocriplasmin than placebo (P= 0.029). Among ocriplasmin-treated eyes at month 6, those with SFL and VMT release had better VA than those with SFL and persistent adhesion (P= 0.037) and similar VA to those with persistent adhesion without SFL (P= 0.17). In the placebo group, those with baseline SFL showed low rates of spontaneous VMT release at month 6 compared with those without baseline SFL (3/21 eyes vs. 33/99 eyes; P= 0.045). Compared with placebo, SFL occurred more frequently only in the initial weeks after treatment with ocriplasmin. When SFL developed after ocriplasmin administration, VA was not impacted at the 6-month visit. Persistent SFL in ocriplasmin-treated eyes at month 6 was associated with poorer vision if VMT had not released. Eyes with SFL at baseline had low rates of spontaneous VMT release and may need treatment. "
Renoprotective Effects of Additional SGLT2 inhibitor Therapy in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus and Chronic Kidney Disease Stages 3b-4: A Real World Report From A Japanese Specialized Diabetes Care Center.,"VAMP2 encodes the vesicular SNARE protein VAMP2 (also called synaptobrevin-2). Together with its partners syntaxin-1A and synaptosomal-associated protein 25 (SNAP25), VAMP2 mediates fusion of synaptic vesicles to release neurotransmitters. VAMP2 is essential for vesicular exocytosis and activity-dependent neurotransmitter release. Here, we report five heterozygous de novo mutations in VAMP2 in unrelated individuals presenting with a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by axial hypotonia (which had been present since birth), intellectual disability, and autistic features. In total, we identified two single-amino-acid deletions and three non-synonymous variants affecting conserved residues within the C terminus of the VAMP2 SNARE motif. Affected individuals carrying de novo non-synonymous variants involving the C-terminal region presented a more severe phenotype with additional neurological features, including central visual impairment, hyperkinetic movement disorder, and epilepsy or electroencephalography abnormalities. Reconstituted fusion involving a lipid-mixing assay indicated impairment in vesicle fusion as one of the possible associated disease mechanisms. The genetic synaptopathy caused by VAMP2 de novo mutations highlights the key roles of this gene in human brain development and function. "
A Rare Case of Spinal Schwannoma in a Child Presenting with Subarachnoid Hemorrhage: A Case Report with Review of Literature.,"To determine the length of the learning curve of femtosecond laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) by a risk-adjusted cumulative sum method. This was a retrospective review of the first 288 FLACS performed by 3 surgeons over a 12 month period. The learning curves were analysed separately for each surgeon and as pooled data via risk-adjusted cumulative sum methods. Change-point analysis was performed to estimate the length of the learning curve. Rates of complications were as follows: anterior capsular tear (ACT) (3.4%), posterior capsular rupture (PCR) (0.7%), vitreous loss (0.3%), iris trauma (0.7%), Descemet's membrane tear (0.3%). There was a strong confidence level (96%) that there was stable performance in terms of PCR after case 16 for the pooled data. Surgeon 1 did not have any cases of PCR, surgeons 2 and 3 exhibited change points at case 5 and 16 respectively (confidence levels = 99%, 98%). There was a strong confidence level (99.8%) that there was stable performance in terms of ACT after case 14 for the pooled data, however the individual surgeons demonstrated individual change points at case 1 (surgeon 1, confidence 99%), case 14 (surgeon 2, confidence 99%), and case 49 (surgeon 3, confidence 96%). The results suggest that there is increased risk of ACT and PCR in FLACS within a surgeon's first 14 and 16 operations respectively. Measures should be adopted to minimize harm to patients during this phase. However, overall rates of complications were safe. "
miR-29a/b cluster suppresses high glucose-induced endothelial-mesenchymal transition in human retinal microvascular endothelial cells by targeting Notch2.,"Western blot analysis is widely used for detecting protein expression, analysis of protein-protein interactions, and searching for new biomarkers. Also, it is a diagnostic tool used for detection of human diseases and microorganism infections.Some Streptococcus pneumoniae proteins are important virulence factors and a few of them are diagnostic markers. Here, we describe the detection of two pneumococcal proteins, pneumolysin and PpmA, in human urine by using monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies. "
miR-204-5p promotes diabetic retinopathy development via downregulation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3.,"Optical coherence tomography angiography (Angio-OCT) has introduced a new non-invasive, quantitative method to assess superficial and deep capillary networks of the retina. In this study, we investigated macular retinal thickness and flow density change following posterior scleral reinforcement (PSR) surgery, using an RTVue XR Avanti Angio-OCT (A2016.2.0.35, Optovue, Fremont, CA), in patients with pathological myopia. A total of 13 patients with pathological myopia were recruited and all patients completed the 6 months follow-up visit. Data from 22 eyes were used in this study. The mean age was 36.2315.29 years, and 43% (n=6) were men. Spherical equivalent refractive error (SE) ranged from -8.0 to -24.0 D. Post-operative axial length, best-corrected visual acuity and SE did not change significantly at each follow-up, compared with preoperative measure (all P>0.05). Postoperative flow density of superficial and deep retinal layers at each sector did not change significantly at each follow-up, compared to pre-operative measure (all P>0.05). However, we found significant decrease in retinal thickness of parafovea-inferior sector after PSR surgery (P<0.01), indicating potential relaxation of vitreofoveal traction after PSR surgery. "
A novel technique for the surgical management of intraocular lens-capsular bag-capsular tension ring complex dislocation.,"A novel treatment for posterior blepharitis which involves the use of disposable wet wipes imbibed with a solution of terpinen-4-ol and hyaluronic acid (Hy-Ter<sup></sup>) as well as aloe, natural anti-inflammatories and antiseptics (Blephapad Combo; Novelty Technology Care, Milan, Italy) has been proposed. The aim of this study was to compare the efficacy and safety of treatment with Blephapad Combo with standard treatment. We conducted 4-week, open-label, randomized controlled study with a closed sequential design at the Magna Graecia University of Catanzaro, Italy in which patients aged>40years with symmetrical bilateral posterior blepharitis were enrolled. Each eye represented a single experimental unit. Patients were randomly assigned using a computer-generated randomization list to apply a reusable heated compress to the eyelid of one eye before cleansing the eyelid with the Blephapad Combo wet wipe (Blephapad Combo treatment arm) or to use the standard treatment of applying a wet and warm gauze to the other eye (standard treatment arm), twice daily for 4weeks. The primary endpoint was the percentage change from baseline to week 4 in meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) grading scale scores. Eighteen patients (9 men; 9 women) with a mean ( standard deviation) age of 66.99.03years were included in the study. Compared with the eye receiving the standard treatment, treatment with Blephapad Combo appeared to improve the MGD total score after 4weeks of treatment (mean change from baseline -29.9 vs. -38.5%). The assessment of the investigators was that in 11 patients the eye treated with Blephapad Combo showed greater benefit, in two patients the eye treated with the standard treatment showed greater benefit and in four patients there was no difference between treatments. Blephapad Combo was well tolerated, with no serious adverse events (AEs) reported. Minor ocular AEs were reported in 44.4 and 38.9% of patients in the Blephard Combo and standard treatment arms, respectively. Treatment with Blephapad Combo was more effective than the standard treatment in ameliorating MGD in patients with posterior blepharitis. Minor ocular AEs events were equally distributed between the two treatments arms. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03301844. "
"A preliminary validation of the Arabic version of the ""Profile of Emotional Competence"" questionnaire among Tunisian adolescent athletes and nonathletes: insights and implications for sports psychology.","The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography (ERG) describes a minimum protocol for clinical testing but encourages more extensive testing where appropriate. This ISCEV extended protocol describes an extension of the ISCEV full-field ERG standard, in which methods to record and evaluate the growth of the dark-adapted (DA) ERG b-wave with increasing stimulus energy are described. The flashes span a range that includes the weakest flash required to generate a reliable DA ERG b-wave and that required to generate a maximal b-wave amplitude. The DA ERG b-wave stimulus-response series (also known historically as the ""intensity-response"" or ""luminance-response"" series) can more comprehensively characterize generalized rod system function than the ISCEV standard ERG protocol and may be of diagnostic or prognostic value in disorders that cause generalized rod system dysfunction.

Long-term outcome of full tendon vertical rectus transposition with Foster suture in unilateral complete sixth cranial nerve palsy.,"The International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision (ISCEV) standard for full-field electroretinography (ERG) describes a minimum protocol for clinical testing but encourages additional ERG testing when appropriate. This ISCEV extended protocol describes methods to record and evaluate a light-adapted (LA) ERG stimulus-response series with increasing flash strengths. The LA ERG stimulus-response series (also referred to as the luminance-response or intensity-response series in the published literature) can characterise generalised cone system function more comprehensively than the ISCEV standard LA ERGs alone. The amplitude of LA ERG a-waves, arising from cones and cone off-bipolar cells, typically shows a saturating function. The LA ERG b-wave amplitudes, which arise primarily from activity of retinal bipolar cells, show an amplitude peak followed by a nonzero plateau (the ""photopic hill"" phenomenon). This ISCEV extended protocol specifies a stimulus-response series suitable to evaluate generalised dysfunction affecting the LA retina, to aid in distinguishing between the on- and off-responses of the cone system and to monitor ERG changes in these characteristics. The LA ERG stimulus-response series for a- and b-waves is recorded to a sequence of nine flash stimuli ranging from 0.03 to 300cdsm<sup>-2</sup>, superimposed on a standard background of 30cdm<sup>-2</sup>. A shorter protocol is also presented to measure the mid-range of the function (the ""photopic hill"") using 5 flash stimuli. "
Comparison of head-mounted perimeter (imo<sup></sup>) and Humphrey Field Analyzer.,"Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is an important cause of infections in humans. Photodynamic therapy using blue light (450nm) could possibly be used to reduce MRSA on different human tissue surfaces without killing the human cells. It could be less harmful than 300-400nm light or common disinfectants. We applied blue light  riboflavin (RF) to MRSA and keratinocytes, in an in vitro liquid layer model, and compared the effect to elimination using common disinfection fluids. MRSA dilutions (810<sup>5</sup>/mL) in wells were exposed to blue light (450nm)  RF at four separate doses (15, 30, 56, and 84J/cm<sup>2</sup>). Treated samples were cultivated on blood agar plates and the colony forming units (CFU) determined. Adherent human cells were cultivated (110<sup>4</sup>/mL) and treated in the same way. The cell activity was then measured by Cell Titer Blue assay after 24- and 48-h growth. The tested disinfectants were chlorhexidine and hydrogen peroxide. Blue light alone (84J/cm<sup>2</sup>) eliminated 70% of MRSA. This dose and riboflavin eradicated 99-100% of MRSA. Keratinocytes were not affected by blue light alone at any dose. A dose of 30J/cm<sup>2</sup> in riboflavin solution inactivated keratinocytes completely. Disinfectants inactivated all cells. Blue light alone at 450nm can eliminate MRSA without inactivation of human keratinocytes. Hence, a high dose of blue light could perhaps be used to treat bacterial infections without loss of human skin cells. Photodynamic therapy using riboflavin and blue light should be explored further as it may perhaps be possible to exploit in treatment of skin diseases associated with keratinocyte hyperproliferation.

"One-year outcomes following implantation of second-generation trabecular micro-bypass stents in conjunction with cataract surgery for various types of glaucoma or ocular hypertension: multicenter, multi-surgeon study.","To report the real-world effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab 0.5 mg in patients with visual impairment due to diabetic macular edema (DME). This is a French, 36-month, multicenter, observational cohort study. Between December 2013 and April 2015, ophthalmologists enrolled diabetic patients aged 18 years with DME-related visual impairment and for whom ranibizumab 0.5 mg was initiated. Here, we present the 12-month results from this cohort. The primary endpoint was the mean change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA); sample size calculations were based on RESTORE trial data (BCVA mean change = 6.8 letters, preci sion = 0.7 letters). Secondary endpoints included the change in central subfield thickness (CSFT), number of visits, number of injections received, and frequency of ocular and nonocular adverse events and serious adverse events. Between December 2013 and April 2015, a total of 290 patients with DME were enrolled by 84 ophthalmologists; 12-month data are available for 242 patients (due to low recruitment rates, precision was recalculated for 242 evaluable patients: the precision was then of 1.0 letters). Mean age ( standard deviation) was 66.1  11.0 years and 56.6% were male. The mean baseline BCVA and CSFT were 59.2 letters (95% confidence interval [CI] 57.3, 61.0) and 457 m (95% CI: 438, 476), respectively. At month 12, the mean gain in BCVA from baseline was 7.4 letters (95% CI: 5.4, 9.4), with 36.8% of patients with BCVA > 70 letters versus 13.2% at baseline. Mean change in CSFT was -125 m (95% CI: -146, -103). The mean number of ranibizumab injections was 5.1  2.3 over an average of 10.4  3.0 visits. No new safety findings were identified. The BOREAL study confirms the effectiveness and safety of ranibizumab for the treatment of DME-related visual impairment in routine clinical practice with fewer injections than reported in clinical trials.

Intralenticular Cilia Following Penetrating Ocular Trauma: A Case Report.,"To evaluate the outcomes and complications of bilateral same-day intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) injections. This is a single-center, retrospective study that included 524 eyes of 262 patients who received concomitant bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections in 2016 at St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto. If any of the patients were receiving simultaneous bilateral injections on a regular basis prior to 2016, data pertaining to previous injections were also reviewed. Everyone received bevacizumab, ranibizumab, or aflibercept in an office setting. A total of 9,798 intravitreal anti-VEGF injections (4,899 bilateral injection sessions) were performed in 524 eyes of 262 patients. The average number of bilateral injection sessions per patient was 18.7  14.1. Ranibizumab was the most commonly used anti-VEGF drug (83.8%). The incidence of endophthalmitis was 0.01%, and there were 2 episodes of acute intraocular inflammation among the 9,798 injections (0.02%). All 3 cases occurred after treatment with ranibizumab. There were 2 deaths (0.76%) due to nonvascular causes but no vascular related systemic adverse events were reported. Same-day bilateral intravitreal anti-VEGF injections present a low rate of complications and are well tolerated by patients. This safe practice may reduce the burden on the health-care system and on the patients. "
Molecularly defined cortical astroglia subpopulation modulates neurons via secretion of Norrin.,"Hearing and vision impairments are highly prevalent among older adults and impact commonly used cognitive assessment tools for the identification of dementia. Adaptations of such tests for people with hearing or vision impairment have not been adequately validated among populations with such sensory impairment. We will develop two versions of the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) for people with acquired hearing impairment (MoCA-H) or vision impairment (MoCA-V). The MoCA-H and MoCA-V will exclude the existing MoCA items that are presented in spoken or visual format, respectively, and include new suitably adapted items. Participants (n=792) with combinations of hearing, vision and cognitive impairment will complete standard or adapted versions of the MoCA across three language sites (English, French and Greek). Development of the MoCA-H and the MoCA-V will be based on analysis of adapted and standard MoCA items following model-based development to select the combination of items for the MoCA-H and MoCA-V that provide optimal sensitivity and specificity for detection of dementia. The study has received ethical approval from respective centres in the UK, France, Greece and Cyprus. The results of the study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publication, conference presentations, the study website (https://www.sense-cog.eu/), the SENSE-Cog Twitter account (@sense_cog) and the MoCA test website (https://www.mocatest.org/). The main outputs of the study will be versions of the MoCA that are appropriate for use with adults with acquired hearing or vision impairment and will contribute significantly to the clinical care of older people.

An opsin 5-dopamine pathway mediates light-dependent vascular development in the eye.,"Familial adult myoclonic epilepsy (FAME), also described with different acronyms (ADCME, BAFME, FEME, FCTE and others), is a high-penetrant autosomal dominant condition featuring cortical hand tremors, myoclonic jerks, and occasional/rare convulsive seizures. Prevalence is unknown since this condition is often under-recognized, but it is estimated to be less than 1/35,000. The disease usually starts in the second decade of life and has been genetically associated with at least 4 different loci (8q24, 2p11.1-q12.2, 5p15.31-p15 and 3q26.32-3q28). Recently, the expansion of non coding TTTTA and TTTCA repeats has been identified as the causative mutation in Japanese families linked to the 8q24. The diagnosis is supported by clinical features and electrophysiological investigations as jerk-locked back averaging, C-reflex, and somatosensory-evoked potential. Photic stimulation, emotional stress, and sleep deprivation may trigger both tonic-clonic and myoclonic seizures. FAME has a slow but progressive clinical course occurring with intellectual disability and worsening of both tremor and myoclonus although with a less severe decline compared to other progressive myoclonic epilepsies. Valproate, levetiracetam, and benzodiazepines are considered the first-line treatments. "
Three de novo DDX3X variants associated with distinctive brain developmental abnormalities and brain tumor in intellectually disabled females.,"Neurodegenerative diseases affecting the posterior segment of the eye are one of the major causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. The pathogenesis of these retinal pathologies is characterized by a multifactorial etiology, involving the complex interaction of different apoptotic mechanisms, suggesting that effective treatments will require a multimodal approach. Thus, combination therapy based on the potential synergistic activities of drugs with different mechanisms of action is currently receiving considerable attention. Here, we summarize several kinds of strategy for the co-administration of different drugs to the posterior segment of the eye, highlighting those that involve co-delivery from multiloaded drug delivery systems.

How stressful is cataract surgery for consultants and ophthalmic trainees? Phacoemulsification is a stressful experience for young consultants.,"This study aimed to develop a stable and biodegradable tacrolimus loaded nanocarrier that enhanced tacrolimus corneal penetration and delivered in a sustained manner, thus to create a promising treatment to prevent immune rejection after corneal allografts. Spherical tacrolimus loaded methoxy poly (ethylene glycol)-block-poly (D,L)-lactic-co-glycolic acid (mPEG-b-PLGA) micelles with a mean diameter of 81.31.3nm were prepared by the solvent-evaporation-induced self-assembly. The physicochemical properties of tacrolimus loaded mPEG-b-PLGA micelles were evaluated, and the in vitro release behavior, degradation, cytotoxicity and bio-safety were all assessed. The ex vivo permeation of tacrolimus using rabbit corneas was also performed, and the cumulative permeation amount of tacrolimus from mPEG-b-PLGA micelles was significantly higher than 0.05% tacrolimus eye drops (p<0.05). These results indicated that the formulations were feasible for intraocular drug delivery. Compared with 0.05% tacrolimus eye drops, the in vivo immunofluorescence analysis indicated the tacrolimus loaded mPEG-b-PLGA micelles remarkably inhibit the immune rejection after corneal allograft, with the lower expression levels of nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4) and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8). In conclusion, we provided evidences that tacrolimus loaded mPEG-b-PLGA micelles would be a promising treatment for immune rejection after corneal transplantation. "
Post-traumatic carotid-cavernous fistula with bilateral proptosis simulating cavernous sinus thrombosis.,"The laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) model in nonhuman primates has played a critical role in the development of new therapies for neovascular age-related macular degeneration. The widespread use of this model, however, has been limited by its high costs, mainly due to the lower efficiency of animal use. We optimized the CNV model by administering repeated photocoagulation treatments to the same eye of each animal, and preliminarily evaluated this model using an assessment of the efficacy of an anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agent to address this problem. Seven rhesus monkeys were included and divided into two groups, which were named the laser-only and laser-bevacizumab groups. Each animal underwent 3 retinal photocoagulation sessions in the same eye at 4-week intervals to induce CNV. Three weeks after the first laser treatment, the animals in the laser-bevacizumab group were administered an intravitreal injection of bevacizumab. Fluorescein angiography (FA) was performed in all animals at multiple time points within 12 weeks to assess the severity and development of CNV following each laser treatment. The laser lesions produced in each photocoagulation session were analysed separately using grading and densitometry methods, and CNV severity was represented by the CNV incidence and the mean integrated fluorescence intensity (MIFI), respectively. Our results showed that in the animals in the laser-only group, the average CNV incidence rates were 62.5%, 42% and 50% at 2 weeks after each laser treatment, and the average MIFI values (x10<sup>5</sup>) were 3.832.36, 2.661.42 and 2.520.18, respectively. No significant differences were found among treatments. After week 2, the CNVs progressed or regressed continuously over 2-6 weeks before stabilization, and the time course of CNV development in each animal was generally the same after each photocoagulation session. In the laser-bevacizumab group, however, the average CNV incidence rates of each laser treatment at week 2 were 50%, 0 and 37.5%, respectively, and the average MIFI values were 3.790.47, 1.090.35 and 2.371.35, respectively. The differences between treatments 1 and 2 were statistically significant. Meanwhile, the CNVs induced by laser treatment 1, which progressed during weeks 2-3, were reduced after bevacizumab administration. The average CNV incidence decreased from 50% at week 3 to 4.2% at week 4, and the average MIFI decreased from 4.621.15 to 1.760.81, both of which were statistically significant. On the other hand, the CNVs induced by treatments 2 and 3 did not show any significant changes over time. Our study demonstrated that repeated retinal photocoagulation in the monkey eye produces relatively consistent CNVs, which can be used to assess the efficacies of anti-angiogenic agents more efficiently.

Hepatocyte-Specific Ablation or Whole Body Inhibition of Xanthine Oxidoreductase in Mice Corrects Obesity-Induced Systemic Hyperuricemia Without Improving Metabolic Abnormalities.,"Craniosynostosis has a varied clinical spectrum, ranging from isolated single suture involvement to multisutural fusions. Syndromic and nonsyndromic patients require orchestrated and multidisciplinary care from birth to adulthood. Advances in our understanding of craniosynostosis over the last quarter-century have resulted in more systematic management of the problems associated with the syndromic and nonsyndromic forms of this condition. This review provides an update on the genetic basis of, management of strabismus and oculoplastic manifestations in, and visual surveillance of patients with craniosynostosis. "
Identification of stemness in primary retinoblastoma cells by analysis of stem-cell phenotypes and tumorigenicity with culture and xenograft models.,"To study the effects of an individualized treatment approach to children with congenital microphthalmos and anophthalmos. Patients with congenital microphthalmos or anopthalmos with orbital cysts who were referred to Beijing Tongren Hospital between July 2009 and July 2017 were included in this retrospective case series study. For patients <6 years of age, the cyst was retained to promote orbital development unless a prosthesis could not be fitted at all or disproportionate orbital growth was detected. Hydrogel orbit expanders were implanted initially if orbital volume was poor. For patients >6 years of age, the cyst was removed if it caused cosmetic problems or unsatisfactory prosthesis fitting. Eyelid procedures were performed after puberty to improve appearance. The study included 26 orbits of 24 patients. Of the 14 patients <6 years, 3 underwent cyst excision, 8 were treated with conformers only, and 3 had hydrogel orbit expander implantation initially. Of the 10 patients >6 years, 1 had the cyst removed, 5 had eyelid surgeries without removing the cyst, 1 wore an artificial eye without any surgery, and 1 used no prosthesis. During the follow-up period (range, 6 months to 8 years), 23 patients had a good cosmetic outcome and were eventually able to retain an ocular prosthesis; 1 patient could not wear prostheses but refused further treatment. No procedure-related complications were noted. The individualized treatment of congenital microphthalmos and anophthalmos with orbital cysts depends on the patient's age at presentation, the growth pattern of the cyst, and the volume of the affected orbit.

Protective or deleterious role of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in diabetic nephropathy: An unresolved issue.,"To assess outcomes of corneal crosslinking (CXL) and intracorneal ring segments (ICRS) (Intacs) used adjunctively, and then compare the safety and efficacy of concurrent versus sequential surgery. Cornea and refractive surgery subspecialty practice. Prospective randomized clinical trial. Patients were randomized to one of two groups: ICRS first, immediately followed by CXL during the same session (n=104), or ICRS followed by CXL 3months later (n=94). Outcomes included changes in maximum keratometry (K) and topographic inferior-superior (I-S) difference, maximum flattening of topographic K, and changes in uncorrected (UDVA) and corrected (CDVA) distance visual acuities. These were analyzed in the entire cohort, in the two randomized groups, and in subgroups stratified to ICRS size and placement. Patients were followed for 6months. The study comprised 198 eyes of 198 patients. Overall, maximum K decreased by an average of 2.5 D, I-S difference improved by 3.9 D, and there was an average maximum flattening of -7.5 D. The UDVA improved by 2.0 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution lines, on average, and the CDVA improved by 1.1 lines. There was no significant difference between the sequential and concurrent groups in any of the outcomes analyzed. There were 6 clinically significant adverse events. CXL and ICRS can be used adjunctively with substantial improvement in corneal topography, and with no increase in safety concerns over each procedure alone. Sequential and concurrent treatment with ICRS and CXL show equivalent outcomes. Both thicker segment size and single segment placement seem to result in greater topographic improvement. "
Disruption of the polyubiquitin gene Ubb causes retinal degeneration in mice.,"Corneal tattooing is a noninvasive technique which appears relatively well-tolerated in the medium term. We report the cases of 3 patients with a significant change in the color of their tattoos performed over 5 years previously. Three patients with a history of intracorneal tattooing several years previously were studied because of a significant change from their initial color. Each patient's file was reviewed with analysis of slit lamp photographs, OCT and specular microscopy. All three patients experienced a significant color change in their tattoos between 5 and 6 years after surgery. The color had changed to golden-brown. Retrospective analysis of the components of the tattoo ink found the presence of iron in the black pigment. We believe that pigments composed of iron oxide are transformed into golden-brown ferric iron oxide in the presence of oxygen in the aqueous environment.The presence of moderate corneal edema in these three cases of multioperated patients could explain, in these specific cases, the occurrence of oxidation typically not described. Corneal tattooing remains a simple and very interesting technique when partial or total absence of iris causes significant photophobia. However, the significant changes in color that we report more than 5 years later suggest omitting iron from the dyes used for the cornea and limiting its use in cases of limited endothelial prognosis. A long-term evaluation of corneal tattoos appears necessary. "
Imaging Infant Retinal Vasculature with OCT Angiography.,"Pathogenic variants in SCN2A are associated with various neurological disorders including epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability. Few reports have recently described SCN2A-associated episodic ataxia (EA). Our study identifies its broader clinical and genetic spectrum, and describes pharmacological approaches. We report 21 patients with SCN2A-associated EA, of which 9 are unpublished cases. The large majority of patients present with epileptic seizures (18/21, 86%), often starting within the first three months of life (12/18, 67%). In contrast, onset of episodic ataxia ranged from 10 months to 14 years of age. The frequency of EA episodes ranged from brief, daily events up to 1-2 episodes per year each lasting several weeks. Potential triggers include minor head traumas and sleep deprivation. Cognitive outcome is favorable in most patients with normal or mildly impaired cognitive development in 17/21 patients (81%). No clear genotype-phenotype correlations were identified in this cohort. However, two mutational hotspots were identified, i.e. 7/21 patients (33%) harbor the identical pathogenic variant p.A263V, whereas 5/21 (24%) carry pathogenic variants that affect the S4 segment and its cytoplasmic loop within the domain IV. In addition, we identified six novel pathogenic variants in SCN2A. While acetazolamide was previously reported as beneficial in SCN2A-associated EA in one case, our data show a conflicting response in 8 additional patients treated with acetazolamide: three of them profited from acetazolamide treatment, while 5/8 did not. Our study describes the heterogeneous clinical spectrum of SCN2A-associated EA, identifies two mutational hotspots and shows positive effects of acetazolamide in about 50%. "
Activated Protein C for Ischemic Central Retinal Vein Occlusion: One-Year Results.,"A three-generation Chinese family with autosomal dominant congenital nuclear cataract was recruited. This study aimed to identify the disease-causing gene for nuclear cataract with functional dissections of the identified mutant. Detailed clinical data and family history were recorded. Candidate gene sequencing was performed to identify the disease-causing mutation. Recombinant connexin50 (Cx50) wild type and mutant constructs were synthesized. Triton X-100 solubility and subcellular localization of the recombinant Cx50 proteins were analyzed in HeLa cells. Apoptosis was assayed as the percentage of fragmented nuclei in transfected cells. All affected individuals in the family displayed clear phenotypes of dense nuclear cataracts. A c.227G>A variation was found in the coding region of Cx50, which arginine residue at position 76 was substituted by histidine (p.R76H). This mutation was co-segregated with the disease in the family, and was not observed in 110 unrelated Chinese controls. No statistically significant differences were found in the Triton X-100 solubility and apoptosis rate between wild type and mutant Cx50 in HeLa cells. However, Cx50 mutant was unable to form gap junctional plaques between adjacent cells as the wild type proteins did. This study identified a novel cataract phenotype caused by the p.R76H mutation in Cx50, providing evidence of further phenotypic heterogeneity associated with this mutation. Functional analysis showed that the mutation affected the formation of gap junction channels and led to opacity in the lens. "
The Natural History of Congenital X-Linked Retinoschisis and Conversion between Phenotypes over Time.,"Genome editing using RNA-guided nucleases in their ribonucleoprotein (RNP) form represents a promising strategy for gene modification and therapy because they are free of exogenous DNA integration and have reduced toxicity in vivo and ex vivo. However, genome editing by Cas9 nuclease from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), has not been reported in its RNP form, which recognizes a longer protospacer adjacent motif (PAM), 5'-NNGRRT-3', compared with SpCas9(Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9) of 5'-NGG-3' PAM. Here, we report SaCas9-RNP mediated genome editing in human cells. The SaCas9-RNP displayed efficient genome editing activities of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) coding gene as well as three endogenous genes (OPA1, RS1 and VEGFA). We further successfully implemented SaCas9-RNP to correct a pathogenic RS1 mutation for X-linked Juvenile Retinoschisis. We also showed that off-target effects triggered by SaCas9-RNP were undetectable by targeted deep sequencing. Collectively, this study demonstrates the potential of SaCas9-RNP mediated genome editing in human cells, which could facilitate genome editing based therapy. This article is protected by copyright.

New Scleral Depressor Marker for Retinal Detachment Surgery.,"NLRP3, as a crucial inflammasome component, plays important roles in age-related macular degeneration. Though some activators of NLRP3 have been studied, microRNAs (miRNAs) which potentially regulate NLRP3 messenger RNA (mRNA) have not been fully explored in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells and retinopathy. In this study, by miRNA microarray proling and bioinformatic analysis, we identified that four miRNAs, miR-4286, miR-223-3p, miR-365a, miR-22-3p, may target NLRP3 mRNA in RPE inflammatory damage in vivo. Further, real-time polymerase chain reaction verified that only miR-22-3p was significantly decreased, which was associated with NLRP3 upregulation in blue-light-induced retinopathy. Mechanistically, the dual-fluorescent reporter suggested miR-22-3p directly binds NLRP3 mRNA. Moreover, overexpression of miR-22-3p could significantly reduce whereas inhibition miR-22-3p could increase the mRNA and protein expressions of NLRP3, Caspase-1, and mature IL-1. Collectively, our results indicate that miR-22-3p plays a suppressive role in RPE damage by targeting NLRP3, which provides new insights into the future intervention to retinopathy. "
"Traumatic Maculopathy with Massive Subretinal Hemorrhage after Closed-Globe Injuries: Associated Findings, Management, and Visual Outcomes.","To investigate receptor and post-receptor function in KCNV2 retinopathy [cone dystrophy with supernormal rod electroretinogram (ERG)], using the pupillary light reflex (PLR) and the ERG. Two unrelated patients (1 male and 1 female) with molecularly confirmed KCNV2 retinopathy underwent full-field two-color pupillometry testing in one eye, with monitoring of the stimulated eye by an infrared digital camera. Pupillometry stimuli consisted of 1-s duration, short-wavelength (465-nm, blue) and long-wavelength (642-nm, red) stimuli. Pupillometry intensity series were performed under both a dark-adapted condition and a light-adapted condition (on a 0.76-logcdm<sup>-2</sup> blue background). The transient PLR, defined as the maximum constriction following flash onset, was measured under all conditions. The melanopsin-mediated sustained constriction was measured 5-7s following flash offset for the highest flash luminance presented in the dark. Both patients were also tested in one eye with the full-field ERG, including a dark-adapted intensity series and ISCEV standard stimuli. Dark-adapted PLRs were markedly attenuated or extinguished for low-luminance stimuli, but the responses to higher-luminance blue stimuli were within normal limits. Light-adapted PLRs to blue stimuli were generally within normal limits, exceeding the responses to photopically matched red stimuli. Thus, light-adapted responses were consistent with either rod or S-cone mediation of the PLR. Melanopsin-mediated sustained PLRs were within normal limits. ERG showed the characteristic findings previously reported in this condition. Cone-mediated ERG responses were markedly decreased in amplitude. Rod-mediated ERG responses were absent for low-luminance stimuli (-3 logcdsm<sup>-2</sup>), but had normal amplitude for stimuli of -2 log cdsm<sup>-2</sup> and above (although none were ""supernormal""). The b-wave for the dark-adapted ISCEV standard -2 log cd s m<sup>-2</sup> stimulus was markedly delayed, whereas the b-wave timing was generally normal for higher flash luminances. The abnormalities measured by pupillometry have a similar pattern to the outer-retinal abnormalities measured by ERG in KCNV2 retinopathy. These findings as well as the normal sustained PLR suggest that inner-retinal function may be preserved in KCNV2 retinopathy and highlight the potential for therapies designed to restore outer-retinal function in these individuals.

"A Multinational Comparison of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Use: The United States, the United Kingdom, and Asia-Pacific.","Albinism patients have poor visual acuity in addition to hypopigmentation. Their foveal anatomy is abnormal, but correlation with function is incompletely understood. This study correlates retinal electrophysiology, visual acuity and optical coherence tomography (OCT) anatomy in albinism patients and compares with age-similar controls. Institutional Review Board approval was obtained (IRB# 201408782). Patients were recruited from clinical practice. Inclusion criteria were at least three clinical features of albinism including iris transillumination, nystagmus, fundus hypopigmentation, or foveal hypoplasia on OCT and/or molecular genetic confirmation. Diagnosys (Lowell, Mass) full-field ERG (ffERG) and VERIS multifocal ERG (mfERG; Electro-Diagnostic Imaging, Milpitas, California) were obtained using standard International Society for Clinical Electrophysiology of Vision protocols. The mfERG protocol was a 4-min 103-hexagon protocol covering approximately 40 in diameter of central retina. Control subjects without albinism were recruited by in-hospital notices and invitations in clinic. OCT central thickness was recorded, and an OCT foveal score was calculated. Nonparametric permutation testing was utilized to determine the statistical significance. A total of 16 albinism patients and 19 age-similar controls were recruited. Four of 16 albinism patients had no nystagmus. Seventeen non-albinism controls had no ocular disorder other than refractive error. Two controls had infantile nystagmus with normal maculas on OCT. There was no statistically significant difference in mfERG amplitude or latency between albinism patients with or without nystagmus (lowest p=0.68; 0.54, respectively). mfERG: 12 of 16 (75%) albinism patients had average ring 1 amplitudes within one standard deviation of controls despite having abnormal foveal anatomy on OCT. Patients averaged shorter latencies in rings 1 and 2 than controls (p=0.005, p=0.02). Patients averaged higher amplitudes than controls in rings 4, 5 and 6 (p=0.03, p=0.006, p=0.004). There was no significant correlation between visual acuity and mfERG amplitudes in any ring (smallest p=0.15). ffERG: Patients averaged higher amplitudes on 30Hz flicker (p=0.008). In all conditions, albinism patients had higher amplitude a-waves (p0.03). B-waves were higher amplitude than controls in light-adapted 3.0 (p=0.03). There was no statistical correlation between ffERG amplitudes and visual acuity (smallest p=0.45). OCT: In albinism patients, thicker central macula on OCT correlated with lower mfERG amplitudes in all rings except for ring 1 (p<0.05) and lower ffERG a-wave amplitudes on dark-adapted 0.01 (p=0.003). Macular thickness on OCT did not correlate with visual acuity (p=0.51); OCT foveal score did (p=0.0004). Amplitude of mfERG does not correlate with visual acuity in any ring in patients with albinism. The slope of the change in amplitude from central to peripheral rings on the mferg is significantly different in albinism patients versus controls whether or not nystagmus is present. The decreased slope of change in amplitudes from center to periphery of the macula in albinism patients indicates changes in macular topography that are more important to visual deficits than the foveal depression.

Clinical Prediction Model for Obstructive Sleep Apnea among Adult Patients with Habitual Snoring.,"The assessment of cup-disc ratio as a surrogate parameter for the neuroretinal rim width (NRW) of the optic nerve is well established, but prone to human error and imprecision. Objective assessment of the NRW is provided by spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). This study is the first to systematically compare NRW measurements acquired with the Carl Zeiss Meditech Cirrus HD-OCT 5000 and the Heidelberg Engineering Spectralis SD-OCT. In this cross-sectional study, 20 eyes of each 20 glaucoma patients and 20 age-matched healthy controls underwent ophthalmic examination, SD-OCT imaging, and computer perimetry. Regression analyses were performed for the NRW comparability and the effect of the rotational alignment disconcordance (RAD), receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) for NRW-based healthy glaucoma discrimination capability, and Pearson's correlation for covariate association. Mean NRW differences were 848m (p=0.4528), 9180m (p<0.01), and 4977m (p<0.001) in the glaucoma, healthy, and whole group. On average, the Cirrus showed higher NRW values (+50m) than the Spectralis, this difference increased with values starting with 159m. Discrimination ROC were 1.0 (Spectralis) and 0.9675 (Cirrus). RAD showed very little effect on NRW (R<sup>2</sup>=0.9661, p<0.001). NRW-covariate correlation was highly significant (p<0.001) with both devices for clinical cup/disc ratio, calculated rim width, visual field mean, and pattern deviations. Our results suggest to only cautiously compare Spectralis and Cirrus NRW measurements only in patients with morphologically manifest glaucoma. For morphological progression analysis, we recommend the continuous usage of the same device. "
Patients opinion and adherence to antimalarials in lupus erythematosus and rheumatoid arthritis treatment.,"The concentrations of high- and low-density-lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides are influenced by smoking, but it is unknown whether genetic associations with lipids may be modified by smoking. We conducted a multi-ancestry genome-wide gene-smoking interaction study in 133,805 individuals with follow-up in an additional 253,467 individuals. Combined meta-analyses identified 13 new loci associated with lipids, some of which were detected only because association differed by smoking status. Additionally, we demonstrate the importance of including diverse populations, particularly in studies of interactions with lifestyle factors, where genomic and lifestyle differences by ancestry may contribute to novel findings.

Short-term anterior chamber inflammation in phacoemulsification with and without Ex-Press glaucoma implant.,"Variants in the ABCA4 gene are causal for a variety of retinal dystrophy phenotypes, including Stargardt disease (STGD1). However, 15% of patients who present with symptoms compatible with STGD1/ABCA4 disease do not have identifiable causal ABCA4 variants. We hypothesized that a case-control collapsing analysis in ABCA4-negative patients with compatible symptoms would provide an objective measure to identify additional disease genes. We performed a genome-wide enrichment analysis of ""qualifying variants""-ultrarare variants predicted to impact protein function-in protein-coding genes in 79 unrelated cases and 9028 unrelated controls. Despite modest sample size, two known retinal dystrophy genes, PRPH2 and CRX, achieved study-wide significance (p<1.3310<sup>-6</sup>) under a dominant disease model, and eight additional known retinal dystrophy genes achieved nominal significance (p<0.05). Across these ten genes, the excess of qualifying variants explained up to 36.8% of affected individuals. Furthermore, under a recessive model, the cone-rod dystrophy gene CERKL approached study-wide significance. Our results indicate that case-control collapsing analyses can efficiently identify pathogenic variants in genes in non-ABCA4 retinal dystrophies. The genome-wide collapsing analysis framework is an objective discovery method particularly suitable in settings with overlapping disease phenotypes. "
Predicting visual outcomes in patients treated with aflibercept for neovascular age-related macular degeneration: Data from a real-world clinical setting.,"This report by a group of UK retina specialists and health professionals considers best practice recommendations for the management of sight-threatening neovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD), based on collective experience and expertise in routine clinical practice. The authors provide an update for ophthalmologists, allied healthcare professionals and commissioners on practice principles for optimal patient care and service provision standards. Refinement of care pathways for nAMD has improved access to intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor therapy but there are still variations in care and reported outcomes between clinic centres. Innovative organisational models of service provision allow providers to better match capacity with increasing demand. The authors review the recent NICE guideline for diagnosis and management of AMD, considerations for switching therapies and stopping treatment and need for regular monitoring of non-affected fellow eyes in patients with unilateral nAMD. Actions for delivery of high-quality care and to improve long-term patient outcomes are discussed. Local pathways need to detail nAMD target time to treat, maintenance of review intervals to ensure proactive treatment regimens are delivered on time and appropriate discharge for patients deemed low risk or no longer benefiting from treatment. Actual visual acuity outcomes achieved and maintenance of the level of vision when disease stability is achieved are considered good measures for judging the quality of care in the treatment of patients with nAMD. Robust community referral pathways must be in place for suspected reactivation of choroidal neovascularisation and rapid referral for second eye involvement. Practical considerations for intravitreal injection therapy are outlined. "
Absence of Therapeutic Benefit of the Anti-Inflammatory Protein TSG-6 for Corneal Alkali Injury in a Rat Model.,"To determine if changes in OCT parameters including peripapillary RNFL thickness and GCC thickness in Egyptian patients with bipolar disorder exist, and to correlate them with disease severity and clinical characteristics. A case-control study conducted on 40 patients with bipolar disorder were compared to 40 matched healthy controls. Both patients and controls were subjected to ophthalmic examination including: BCVA, slit-lamp examination, fundus examination, and OCT imaging. Patients were also subjected to Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Thinning of average (RNFL) and average (GCC) thickness of right and left eye in patients with BPD (whether received electroconvulsive therapy or not) when compared with control subjects. Number of episodes, age at onset and severity of disease showed insignificant correlation with OCT parameters. Significant degenerative changes were detected by OCT in patients with bipolar disorder that were not affected by receiving ECT and not related to disease severity or duration. "
Takayasu Arteritis with Atrial Septal Defect Presenting as Sterile Corneal Melt.,"The purpose of this study was to evaluate macular ganglion cell layer-inner plexiform layer (GCL-IPL) and choroidal thickness in early age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in eyes with subretinal drusenoid deposits (SDD). Comprehensive ophthalmological examination was performed. Near infrared reflectance and raster images using enhanced depth imaging were acquired with spectral domain optical coherence tomography. Drusen and SDD were diagnosed based on raster scans and near infrared reflectance. GCL-IPL maps were generated with automated segmentation and choroidal thickness maps were obtained by manually delineating the choroid-scleral boundary. Forty-eight eyes from 48 patients (mean age 77.55.7, range 68-90 years) with a diagnosis of early AMD and 42 eyes of 42 age-matched control subjects (mean age 76.95.7, range 67-88 years) were included. Of these, 28 eyes (58.3%) had drusen alone, 4 eyes (8.3%) had SDD alone, and 16 eyes (33.3%) had drusen associated with SDD. Compared with controls, average choroidal thickness was significantly decreased in AMD eyes (P<0.05). There was no significant difference in choroidal thickness in eyes with SDD with respect to those with drusen alone. GCL-IPL thickness was reduced in an annular pattern at the 3 and 6mm macular areas in AMD patients with respect to controls (P<0.05). GCL-IPL thickness at 3mm was significantly reduced in eyes with SDD with respect to those with drusen alone (P=0.03). The GCL-IPL is reduced in thickness with an annular pattern in early AMD and is significantly thinner in eyes with SDD. "
Maximum Temperature and Solar Radiation as Predictors of Bipolar Patient Admission in an Emergency Psychiatric Ward.,"Hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S) serves as a gasotransmitter in the regulation of organ development and maintenance of homeostasis in tissues. Its abnormal levels are associated with multiple human diseases, such as neurodegenerative disease, myocardial injury, and ophthalmic diseases. Excessive exposure to H<sub>2</sub>S could lead to cellular toxicity, orchestrate pathological process, and increase the risk of various diseases. Interestingly, under physiological status, H<sub>2</sub>S plays a critical role in maintaining cellular physiology and limiting damages to tissues. In mammalian species, the generation of H<sub>2</sub>S is catalyzed by cystathionine beta-synthase (CBS), cystathionine gamma-lyase (CSE), 3-mercapto-methylthio pyruvate aminotransferase (3MST) and cysteine aminotransferase (CAT). These enzymes are found inside the mammalian eyeballs at different locations. Their aberrant expression and the accumulation of substrates and intermediates can change the level of H<sub>2</sub>S by orders of magnitude, causing abnormal structures or functions in the eyes. Detailed investigations have demonstrated that H<sub>2</sub>S donors' administration could regulate intraocular pressure, protect retinal cells, inhibit oxidative stress and alleviate inflammation by modulating the function of intra or extracellular proteins in ocular tissues. Thus, several slow-releasing H<sub>2</sub>S donors have been shown to be promising drugs for treating multiple diseases. In this review, we discuss the biological function of H<sub>2</sub>S metabolism and its application in ophthalmic diseases. "
Suppression of Light-Induced Retinal Degeneration by Quercetin via the AP-1 Pathway in Rats.,"Two types of mammalian direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), ON and ONOFF, operate over different speed ranges. The directional axes of the ON-DSGCs are thought to align with the axes of the vestibular system and provide sensitivity at rotational velocities that are too slow to activate the semicircular canals. ONOFF-DSGCs respond to faster image velocities. Using natural images that simulate the natural visual inputs to freely moving animals, we show that simulated visual saccades suppress responses in ON-DSGCs but not ONOFF-DSGCs recorded in retinas of domestic rabbits of either gender. Analysis of the synaptic inputs shows that this saccadic suppression results from glycinergic inputs that are specific to ON-DSGCs and are absent in ONOFF-DSGCs. When this glycinergic input is blocked, both cell-types respond similarly to visual saccades and display essentially identical speed tuning. The results demonstrate that glycinergic circuits within the retina can produce saccadic suppression of retinal ganglion cell activity. The cell-type specific targeting of the glycinergic circuits further supports the proposed physiological roles of ON-DSGCs in retinal-image stabilization and of ONOFF-DSGCs in detecting local object motion and signaling optical flow.<b>Significance statement:</b>In the mammalian retina, ON direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs) respond preferentially to slow image motion, while ONOFF DSGCs respond better to rapid motion. The mechanisms producing this different speed tuning remain unclear. Here we show that simulated visual saccades suppress ON-DSGCs, but not ONOFF-DSGCs. This selective saccadic suppression is due to the selective targeting of glycinergic inhibitory synaptic inputs to ON-DSGCs. The different saccadic suppression in the two cell types points to different physiological roles, consistent with their projections to distinct areas within the brain. ON-DSGCs may be critical for providing the visual feedback signals that contribute to stabilizing the image on the retina, while ONOFF-DSGCs may be important for detecting the onset of saccades or for signaling optical flow.

Endometrial Vascularization Characterized by Optical Coherence Tomography and Immunohistochemistry in Women Undergoing In Vitro Fertilization-Embryo Transfer Treatment.,"Dysregulation of the alternative complement pathway (AP) predisposes individuals to a number of diseases including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and C3 glomerulopathy. Moreover, glomerular Ig deposits can lead to complement-driven nephropathies. Here we describe the discovery of a highly potent, reversible, and selective small-molecule inhibitor of factor B, a serine protease that drives the central amplification loop of the AP. Oral administration of the inhibitor prevents KRN-induced arthritis in mice and is effective upon prophylactic and therapeutic dosing in an experimental model of membranous nephropathy in rats. In addition, inhibition of factor B prevents complement activation in sera from C3 glomerulopathy patients and the hemolysis of human PNH erythrocytes. These data demonstrate the potential therapeutic value of using a factor B inhibitor for systemic treatment of complement-mediated diseases and provide a basis for its clinical development. "
Brain Aging in Midlife: The Beaver Dam Offspring Study.,"To determine the correlation between superior limbic keratoconjunctivitis (SLK) and selected tear cytokines and to evaluate the efficacy of these cytokines in monitoring the response of patients with SLK to either medical treatment alone or in combination with conjunctival resection. A cohort study. Twenty-five eyes of 13 patients with SLK were assigned to either medically responsive or surgical treatment groups depending on their responses 1month after initial medical treatment. Treatment efficacy was assessed by improvements in clinical grading and decreases in the levels of tear cytokines. Fourteen eyes were improved by medical treatment alone, whereas satisfactory outcomes were achieved for the remaining 11 eyes after surgical management. The overall grading prior to medical treatment was lower in medically responsive group compared with surgical treatment group (p=0.0139). Among the examined tear cytokines, monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1 was positively associated with the severity of clinical grading (p=0.0251). While both treatments significantly decreased the levels of MCP-1 and interleukin-6, surgical treatment also decreased the levels of interferon- and tumour necrosis factor-. Notably, overall cytokine levels after surgical treatment were lower than those after medical treatment alone. Since an association of tear MCP-1 level with the clinical grading and treatment response of SLK was observed in this study, tear MCP-1 may be a potential indicator of SLK disease severity. According to the degree to which the tear cytokine levels were decreased, surgical treatment appears to be an effective treatment modality for patients with SLK who are refractory to medical treatment alone.

Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Concentrations and Incidence of Age-Related Macular Degeneration: The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities Study.,"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been regarded as potential modulators in varying ocular diseases, including age-related cataract (ARC). However, the roles of miR-221 in ARC progression and its underlying mechanism remain poorly understood. In this study, human lens epithelial cell line (SRA01/04) was used to investigate the potential function of miR-221 in vitro. The expressions of miR-221, sirtuin-1 (SIRT1) and E2F transcription factor 3 (E2F3) were measured in ARC tissues by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and western blotting, respectively. To investigate the effect of miR-221, SIRT1 and E2F3 on cell apoptosis, SRA01/04cells were transfected with miR-221 inhibitor, negative control inhibitor, pcDNA3.1-SIRT1 overexpression vector, pcDNA3.1-E2F3 overexpression vector or pcDNA3.1 empty vector. After the transfection, cell viability was detected in SRA01/04cells at 0, 24, 48 or 72h by cell counting kit-8 assay. Cell apoptosis was evaluated in transfected SRA01/04cells by flow cytometry and western blotting at 72h. The interaction between miR-221 and SIRT1 or E2F3 was probed by luciferase activity and RNA immunoprecipitation assays. Results showed that high expression of miR-221 was exhibited in ARC tissues compared with that in normal samples and associated with Lens Opacities Classification System III grades. Knockdown of miR-221 promoted cell viability and inhibited apoptosis in SRA01/04cells. Moreover, both of SIRT1 and E2F3 levels were directly targeted by miR-221 and down-regulated in ARC tissues. Besides, overexpression of SIRT1 or E2F3 increased cell viability and suppressed apoptosis in SRA01/04cells, which was reversed by addition of miR-221. We concluded that miR-221 promoted lens epithelial cells apoptosis through regulating SIRT1 and E2F3, providing a novel biomarker for treatment of ARC. "
Bipolar Cell Type-Specific Expression and Conductance of Alpha-7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptors in the Mouse Retina.,"Electroretinograms (ERGs) elicited by high temporal frequency (26-95Hz) L- and M-cone isolating sine-wave stimuli were investigated in human observers for full-field (FF) and different spatially restricted stimulus sizes (70, 50, 30, and 10 diameter). Responses to L- and M-cone isolating FF stimuli were maximal around 48Hz and decreased gradually with increasing temporal frequency up to 95Hz. The response maximum was shifted to about 30-32Hz for both L- and M-cone driven responses obtained with spatially restricted stimuli. The M-cone driven responses could only be measured up to 54Hz with 70 stimuli. The response amplitudes for L- and M-cones and L-/M-cone amplitude ratios decreased with decreasing stimulus size. The ERG response phases to L- and M-cone isolating stimuli decreased with increasing temporal frequency and were about -160 apart for all stimulus sizes up to 34Hz. Further increase in the temporal frequency displayed a positive correlation between stimulus size and L-M phase difference. The ERG data indicate that the responses evoked by high temporal frequency cone isolating stimuli reflect two mechanisms, one that is more centrally located and displays a maximum at about 30-32Hz and a peripheral mechanism that is sensitive to higher temporal modulations. We propose that the peripheral mechanism (FF ERGs) reflects magnocellular activity, whereas the central mechanism (ERGs with spatially restricted stimuli) is based on a parvocellular activity up to about 30Hz. "
Analysis of X-ray scattering microstructure data for implementation in numerical simulations of ocular biomechanical behaviour.,"The suprachoroidal space (SCS) has been a successful target to lower intraocular pressure (IOP) in glaucoma patients. We present the results of 4 patients who underwent a novel glaucoma surgical procedure to lower IOP: Intrascleral Ciliary Sulcus-Suprachoroidal Microtube. A sterile medical grade silicone microtube (Tube extender, New World Medical) was surgically placed to drain aqueous from the posterior chamber ciliary sulcus of the eye to the SCS. The internal diameter of the tube was 300 um and the length varied from 8-10mm. After informed consent was obtained and witnessed, this procedure was performed in glaucoma patients with pseudophakia. The tube was placed intrasclerally beneath an inferotemporal sclera flap (50% thickness approximately 4mm x 4mm). The anterior end of the tube was inserted into the ciliary sulcus approximately 2mm from the limbus and the posterior end was placed into the SCS approximately 4mm from the limbus. The microtube was sutured to the sclera with a 10-0 nylon suture. 8-0 vicryl sutures were used to close the sclera flap and the conjunctiva inferotemporally. All 4 patients had lower IOP. The average reduction of IOP was 36% at 3 months. The amount of glaucoma medications per patient at 3 months dropped from an average of 3 to 0.25. The risks are similar to traditional glaucoma incisional surgery. This new technique of Intrascleral Ciliary Sulcus-Suprachoroidal Microtube in all four patients with mild, moderate, and advanced glaucoma demonstrated a significant lowering of IOP and a decrease in the number of medications. Further research is required to assess long term efficacy and safety. "
The role of primary intraocular lens implantation in the risk of secondary glaucoma following congenital cataract surgery: A systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) is an autoimmune relapsing demyelinating disorder which often leads to severe disability typically targeting spinal cord, optic nerves, and brainstem. Around 75% of NMOSD patients have serum immunoglobulin-G (IgG) autoantibodies to the aquaporin-4 channel (AQP4-IgG). AQP4-IgG antibodies have a central role in new diagnostic criteria of NMOSD. These antibodies have a critical role in long-term management after the first attack. The prevalence of this disorder is lower than multiple sclerosis in European countries. However, NMO makes a substantial proportion of the demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system in countries like Pakistan, where it can be mistaken for multiple sclerosis. Accurate diagnosis is essential as some of the drugs for multiple sclerosis can potentially worsen NMOSD. We present a case of sequential optic neuritis with positive aquaporin 4 antibodies. We have discussed the history, examination findings, diagnostic workups, and treatment of the patient. "
Novel hybrid action of GABA mediates inhibitory feedback in the mammalian retina.,"Subscleral trabeculectomy is the most common surgical treatment for glaucoma. However, wound healing and scar formation may result in bleb fibrosis, leading to bleb failure. The healing response of the wound is reported to be the single most important risk factor in determining the final intraocular pressure after glaucoma filtration surgery. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the effect of preoperative beta irradiation and intraoperative mitomycin C treatment as combined adjuncts to subscleral trabeculectomy in the management of glaucoma in Egyptian patients. This prospective, interventional, comparative masked clinical study was performed between October 2016 and January 2018. This study included 50 subjects, 25 of whom underwent trabeculectomy augmented by mitomycin C intra-operatively and beta radiation preoperatively at the bleb area (patient group #1). The remaining 25 subjects underwent trabeculectomy with mitomycin C alone (control group #2). Beta radiation was administered 5-7 days before the surgery as a single dose (1000cGy) using a strontium-90 probe. Mitomycin C (0.2mg/mL) was administered for 2 minutes. There was a statistically significant difference in postoperative intraocular pressure between the groups from the second week. Intraoperative hyphema occurred in six cases in control group #2, whereas no intraoperative hyphema was observed in patient group#1; this difference was statistically significant. Subscleral trabeculectomy augmented by beta radiation and mitomycin C gives greater control over intraocular pressure. Therefore, we recommend using beta radiation prior to trabeculectomy in patients who may have a high risk of developing conjunctival fibrosis. "
Evaluation of the Ocular Surface in Different Contact Lens Replacement Schedules.,"Amid the increasing clinical application of hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers in the ocular adnexa is a paucity of histological data concerning the fate of the injected material. The current study documents the in vivo biodegradation of HA deposited in the eyelid and orbit. The study included 22 chinchilla rabbits. The right upper eyelid of 12 rabbits received a single 0.2 ml Restylane (Galderma, Uppsala, Sweden) subcutaneous injection. In 10 different rabbits, the right orbit was injected with 1.0 ml Restylane SubQ (Galderma, Uppsala, Sweden) in the extraconal space. The rabbits in the eyelid group were euthanized at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2, 4, 6, and 9 months, while the rabbits in the orbit group were euthanized at 1 month, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months. Histological analysis was performed on the harvested samples. In the eyelid, the HA assumed a sponge-like structure that diminished gradually over time. At 9 months, the injected HA partially persisted, mainly in the peripheral areas of injection. A similar histologic pattern was observed in the injected orbits, with slow changes persisting at the eighteenth month. In both cohorts, clear signs of collagen deposition and pseudocapsule formation were observed around HA droplets, with no signs inflammation. HA injected subcutaneously into the eyelid and orbit of rabbits undergoes slow and gradual biodegradation, with HA persisting to no less than 9 months in the eyelid and 18 months in orbit. Neocollagen synthesis and lack of hyaluronidase activity could explain the unexpectedly prolonged HA persistence. "
Evaluation of Dry Eye Disease in Children With Systemic Lupus Erythematosus and Healthy Controls.,"To identify the accurate clinical diagnosis of rare syndromic inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) based on the combination of clinical and genetic analyses. Four unrelated families with various autosomal recessive syndromic inherited retinal diseases were genetically investigated using whole-exome sequencing (WES). Two affected subjects in family MOL0760 presented with a distinctive combination of short stature, developmental delay, congenital mental retardation, microcephaly, facial dysmorphism and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). Subjects were clinically diagnosed with suspected Kabuki syndrome. WES revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.5492dup, p.Asn1831Lysfs*8) in VPS13B that is known to cause Cohen syndrome. The index case of family MOL1514 presented with both RP and liver dysfunction, suspected initially to be related. WES identified a homozygous frameshift mutation (c.1787_1788del, p.His596Argfs*47) in AGBL5, associated with nonsyndromic RP. The MOL1592 family included three affected subjects with crystalline retinopathy, skin ichthyosis, short stature and congenital adrenal hypoplasia, and were found to harbour a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.682C>T, p.Arg228Cys) in ALDH3A2, reported to cause Sjgren-Larsson syndrome (SLS). In the fourth family, SJ002, two siblings presented with hypotony, psychomotor delay, dysmorphic facial features, pathologic myopia, progressive external ophthalmoplegia and diffuse retinal atrophy. Probands were suspected to have atypical Kearns-Sayre syndrome, but were diagnosed with combined oxidative phosphorylation deficiency-20 due to a novel suspected missense variant (c.1691C>T, p.Ala564Val) in VARS2. Our findings emphasize the important complement of WES and thorough clinical investigation in establishing precise clinical diagnosis. This approach constitutes the basis for personalized medicine in rare IRDs. "
Effect of Anti-Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Therapy on Corneal Nerves.,"To examine the association between self-reported vision impairment (VI), hearing impairment (HI), and dual-sensory impairment (DSI), stratified by dementia status, on hospital admissions, hospice use, and healthcare costs. Retrospective analysis. Medicare Current Beneficiary Survey from 1999 to 2006. Rotating panel of community-dwelling Medicare beneficiaries, aged 65years and older (N=24 009). VI and HI were ascertained by self-report. Dementia status was determined by self-report or diagnosis codes in claims data. Primary outcomes included any inpatient admission over a 2-year period, hospice use over a 2-year period, annual Medicare fee-for-service costs, and total healthcare costs (which included information from Medicare claims data and other self-reported payments). Self-reported DSI was present in 30.2% (n=263/871) of participants with dementia and 17.8% (n= 4112/23 138) of participants without dementia. In multivariable logistic regression models, HI, VI, or DSI was generally associated with increased odds of hospitalization and hospice use regardless of dementia status. In a generalized linear model adjusted for demographics, annual total healthcare costs were greater for those with DSI and dementia compared to those with DSI without dementia ($28 875 vs $3340, respectively). Presence of any sensory impairment was generally associated with higher healthcare costs. In a model adjusted for demographics, Medicaid status, and chronic medical conditions, DSI compared with no sensory impairment was associated with a small, but statistically significant, difference in total healthcare spending in those without dementia ($1151 vs $1056; P <.001) but not in those with dementia ($11 303 vs $10 466; P =.395). Older adults with sensory and cognitive impairments constitute a particularly prevalent and vulnerable population who are at increased risk of hospitalization and contribute to higher healthcare spending.

Recent Surgical Trends in Pediatric Corneal Transplantation: A 13-Year Review.,"The association of diabetic microvascular complications such as diabetic retinopathy (DR) and diabetic kidney disease (DKD) with mortality in populations is not clear. To examine the association of DR and DKD separately and jointly with all-cause and cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality in a multiethnic Asian population. A population-based cohort study was conducted including 2964 adults between the ages of 40 and 80 years with diabetes who participated in the Singapore Epidemiology of Eye Diseases study (baseline, 2004-2011). Data analysis was performed from January to May 2018. Diabetic retinopathy ascertained from retinal photographs and DKD from estimated glomerular filtration rate. All-cause and CVD mortality obtained by linkage with the National Registry of Births and Deaths until May 2017. Of the 2964 adults (mean [SD] age, 61.8 [10.0] years; 1464 [49.4%] female; 592 Chinese, 1052 Malay, and 1320 Indian), 29.9% of the participants had DR, while 20.7% had DKD. Over a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 8.8 (7.2-11.0) years, 610 deaths occurred (20.6%), of which 267 (9.0%) were due to CVD. In separate models, the multivariable hazard ratios for all-cause and CVD mortality were 1.54 (95% CI, 1.24-1.91) and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.27-2.40), respectively, for DR and 2.04 (95% CI, 1.64-2.56) and 2.29 (95% CI, 1.64-3.19), respectively, for DKD. In models including both DR and DKD, the subgroup with DKD alone (27.1% and 12.6%) followed by DR alone (6.5% and 5.2%) contributed substantially to the excess risk of all-cause and CVD mortality. Compared with those with no DR and DKD, the hazard ratios of all-cause and CVD mortality were 1.89 (95% CI, 1.40-2.57) and 2.26 (95% CI, 1.42-3.61), respectively, for DKD alone and 1.38 (95% CI, 1.03-1.86) and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.06-2.56), respectively, for DR alone. Hazard ratios for all-cause and CVD mortality were 2.76 (95% CI, 2.05-3.72) and 3.41 (95% CI, 2.19-5.32), respectively, for those with both DKD and DR. The relative excess risk associated with the interaction was 0.49 (95% CI, -0.29 to 1.27; P=.20) for all-cause mortality and 0.51 (95% CI, -0.83 to 1.85; P=.50) for CVD mortality. These results suggest that risks of all-cause and CVD mortality were significantly higher in those with DKD and DR, but DKD was more strongly associated with excess risk. The findings underscore the importance of early identification and close monitoring and management of patients with DR and DKD to reduce the risk of death. "
Patient-attentive sequential strategy for perimetry-based visual field acquisition.,"Some of the unexplained heritability of Alzheimer disease (AD) may be due to rare variants whose effects are not captured in genome-wide association studies because very large samples are needed to observe statistically significant associations. To identify genetic variants associated with AD risk using a nonstatistical approach. Genetic association study in which rare variants were identified by whole-exome sequencing in unrelated individuals of European ancestry from the Alzheimer's Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). Data were analyzed between March 2017 and September 2018. Minor alleles genome-wide and in 95 genes previously associated with AD, AD-related traits, or other dementias were tabulated and filtered for predicted functional impact and occurrence in participants with AD but not controls. Support for several findings was sought in a whole-exome sequencing data set comprising 19 affected relative pairs from Utah high-risk pedigrees and whole-genome sequencing data sets from the ADSP and Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. Among 5617 participants with AD (3202 [57.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 76.4 [9.3] years) and 4594 controls (2719 [59.0%] women; mean [SD] age, 86.5 [4.5] years), a total of 24 variants with moderate or high functional impact from 19 genes were observed in 10 or more participants with AD but not in controls. These variants included a missense mutation (rs149307620 [p.A284T], n=10) in NOTCH3, a gene in which coding mutations are associated with cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL), that was also identified in 1 participant with AD and 1 participant with mild cognitive impairment in the whole genome sequencing data sets. Four participants with AD carried the TREM2 rs104894002 (p.Q33X) high-impact mutation that, in homozygous form, causes Nasu-Hakola disease, a rare disorder characterized by early-onset dementia and multifocal bone cysts, suggesting an intermediate inheritance model for the mutation. Compared with controls, participants with AD had a significantly higher burden of deleterious rare coding variants in dementia-associated genes (2314 vs 3354 cumulative variants, respectively; P=.006). Different mutations in the same gene or variable dose of a mutation may be associated with result in distinct dementias. These findings suggest that minor differences in the structure or amount of protein may be associated with in different clinical outcomes. Understanding these genotype-phenotype associations may provide further insight into the pathogenic nature of the mutations, as well as offer clues for developing new therapeutic targets. "
Low-Intensity Exercise in Mice Is Sufficient to Protect Retinal Function During Light-Induced Retinal Degeneration.,"MicroRNA-182 (miR-182) is abundantly expressed in mammalian retinas; however, the association between miR-182 and retinal function remains unclear. In this study, we explored whether miR-182 contributes to functional decline in retinas using a miR-182 depleted mouse. Electroretinogram (ERG) amplitudes at different ages were measured in miR-182 knockout (KO) mice. The thickness and lamination of retinas were assessed using a color fundus camera and high-resolution optical coherence tomography. Expression levels of key photoreceptor-specific genes and the miR-183/96/182 cluster (miR-183C) were quantified using quantitative real-time PCR. RNA sequencing and light-induced damage were carried out to observe the changes in the retinal transcriptome and sensitivity to light damage in the miR-182 KO mice. The ERG recording reveals that the ERG response amplitude decreased both at early and later ages when compared with control littermates. The expression of some key photoreceptor-specific genes was down-regulated with deletion of miR-182 in retina. RNA sequencing indicated that some biological processes of visual system were affected, and the numbers of potential target genes of miR-182 were presented in the mouse retina using bioinformatics analysis. The miR-182 KO mice were characterized by progressively losing the outer segment after being treated with light-damage exposure. The thickness and lamination of retina as well as compensatory expression of miR-183C showed no apparent changes in retina of miR-182 KO mice under normal laboratory lighting condition. Our findings provided new insights into the relationship between the miR-182 and retinal development and revealed that miR-182 may play a critical role in maintaining retinal function. "
Correlation of the Retinal Parapapillary Perfusion and the Retinal Vessel Oxygen Saturation in Glaucoma Patients.,"To investigate whether rapamycin protects tear production and the ocular surface during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced dry eye syndrome in mice. Tunicamycin was injected intraperitoneally in BALB/c mice without or with rapamycin (TM or RM5 group). Peritoneal injection of PBS performed in vehicle group. Group without injection served as control. Blinking rate, fluorescein staining score (FSS), and phenol red thread tear production test were measured at 4 days, 1 week, and 2 weeks after treatment. Levels of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines were measured by ELISA. Blinking rate and FSS were elevated, and tear production was decreased in TM group compared with controls (P < 0.05 for all), which was ameliorated by rapamycin at 1 and 2 weeks. Levels of inflammatory and angiogenic cytokines in the cornea and lacrimal glands were higher in the TM group than controls, and lower in the RM5 group than the TM group at 1 and 2 weeks (P < 0.05 for all). Rapamycin protected tear production and the ocular surface against this dry eye syndrome by ameliorating ER stress-induced vascular damage and inflammation of lacrimal glands and the ocular surface.

Mycoplasma Ocular Infection in Subretinal Graft Transplantation of iPS Cells-Derived Retinal Pigment Epithelial Cells.,"The purpose of this study was to explore macula vessel density and foveal avascular zone (FAZ) parameters in exfoliation glaucoma (XFG) compared to primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) using optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA). This was a cross-sectional observational study. Twenty-six XFG and 28 POAG patients with comparable visual field defects on Humphrey 24-2 and 10-2 perimetries were recruited. OCTA scans (3  3 mm) centered on the fovea were obtained. Built-in software was used to measure superficial capillary plexus (SCP) vessel density at different quadrants of the macula. Custom software was then used to create a full-thickness image. The FAZ was manually delineated, and large vessels were removed. Vessel density in eight concentric rings with increments of 200-m diameters from the delineated FAZ was measured. FAZ parameters were calculated using the custom software. SCP density was significantly lower in the superior (mean difference [MD] = -4.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = -7.02, -1.61, P = 0.003) and nasal (MD = -3.00, 95% CI = 05.22, -0.77, P = 0.010) quadrants in XFG versus POAG. SCP vessel density using the concentric ring approach revealed significantly decreased values at all eight rings in XFG versus POAG. In the full-thickness analysis, density was significantly less in the XFG group in all rings except the initial 200 m. No significant differences existed in FAZ parameters between the groups. Despite the presence of comparable central visual field defects, the macula vessel density was predominately lower in XFG compared with POAG in our sample of patients. Further studies are warranted to investigate the consistency of our results. "
Discovering Mechanisms in the Changing and Diverse Pathology of Retinopathy of Prematurity: The Weisenfeld Award Lecture.,"To determine whether high-resolution retinal imaging measures of macular structure correlate with visual function over 36 months in retinal degeneration (RD) patients and normal subjects. Twenty-six eyes of 16 RD patients and 16 eyes of 8 normal subjects were studied at baseline; 15 eyes (14 RD) and 11 eyes (6 normal) were studied 36 months later. Adaptive Optics Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (AOSLO) was used to identify regions of interest (ROIs) with unambiguous cones at baseline to measure cone spacing. AOSLO images were aligned with spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and fundus-guided microperimetry results to correlate structure and function at the ROIs. SD-OCT images were segmented to measure inner segment (IS) and outer segment (OS) thickness. Correlations between cone spacing, IS and OS thickness and sensitivity were assessed using Spearman correlation coefficient  with bootstrap analyses clustered by person. Cone spacing ( = 0.57, P < 0.001) and macular sensitivity ( = 0.19, P = 0.14) were significantly correlated with eccentricity in patients. Controlling for eccentricity, cone spacing Z-scores were inversely correlated with IS ( = -0.29, P = 0.002) and OS thickness ( = -0.39, P < 0.001) in RD patients only, and with sensitivity in normal subjects ( = -0.22, P < 0.001) and RD patients ( = -0.38, P < 0.001). After 36 months, cone spacing increased (P < 0.001) and macular sensitivity decreased (P = 0.007) compared to baseline in RD patients. Cone spacing increased and macular sensitivity declined significantly in RD patients over 36 months. High resolution images of cone structure correlated with retinal sensitivity, and may be appropriate outcome measures for clinical trials in RD. "
Reply.,"Current understanding of local disease pathophysiology in AMD is limited. Analysis of the human disease-affected tissue is most informative, as gene expression, expressed quantitative trait loci, microenvironmental, and epigenetic changes can be tissue, cell type, and location specific. Development of a novel translational treatment and prevention strategies particularly for earlier forms of AMD are needed, although access to human ocular tissue analysis is challenging. We present a standardized protocol to study rapidly processed postmortem donor eyes for molecular biochemical and genomic studies. We partnered with the Utah Lions Eye Bank to obtain donor human eyes, blood, and vitreous, within 6 hours postmortem. Phenotypic analysis was performed using spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and color fundus photography. Macular and extramacular tissues were immediately isolated, and the neural retina and retinal pigment epithelium/choroid from each specimen were separated and preserved. Ocular disease phenotype was analyzed using clinically relevant grading criteria by a group of four ophthalmologists incorporating data from SD-OCT retinal images, fundus photographs, and medical records. The use of multimodal imaging leads to greater resolution of retinal pathology, allowing greater phenotypic rigor for both interobserver phenotype and known clinical diagnoses. Further, our analysis resulted in excellent quality RNA, which demonstrated appropriate tissue segregation. The Utah protocol is a standardized methodology for analysis of disease mechanisms in AMD. It uniquely allows for simultaneous rigorous phenotypic, molecular biochemical, and genomic analysis of both systemic and local tissues. This better enables the development of disease biomarkers and therapeutic interventions. "
Reply.,"Inherited retinal dystrophy (IRD) is a group of retinal disorders that are both clinically and genetically diverse, typically with loss of photoreceptor function. Herein, we aimed to identify the underlying genetic defect in IRD patients with mutations in the SLC7A14 gene. A targeted exome capture panel was applied for mutational screening of SLC7A14. Targeted exome sequencing (TES) was performed on 200 non-syndromic and unrelated autosomal recessive or sporadic IRD families. Candidate variants were validated by direct sequencing and further examined using bioinformatics analyses for determination of their potential effect. We identified compound heterozygous missense mutations (c.988G>A, p.G330R; c.1970G>A, p.R657Q) in an autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (RP) case and a homozygous mutation (c.988G>A, p.G330R) in a simplex case with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) in the SLC7A14 gene. Both G330R and R657Q were deleterious based on in silico predictive tools. Our proposed topological model of the SLC7A14 polypeptide suggested that both G330R and R657Q affected evolutionarily highly conserved amino acid residues in SLC7A14 that occurred in transmembrane helixes. Structural modeling revealed a broken arginine and aspartic acid connection between residues 657 and 406. We applied TES to the molecular diagnosis of patients with IRD and for the first time identified SLC7A14 mutations in two unrelated families with RP and LCA separately. Our findings uniquely add the knowledge of the phenotypic variability of SLC7A14 mutations. "
Reply.,"Pathologic myopia (PM) is a major cause of irreversible visual impairment worldwide and especially in East Asian countries. The complications of PM include myopic maculopathy, myopic macular retinoschisis, dome-shaped macula, and myopic optic neuropathy. Posterior staphyloma is an important component of the diagnosis of PM and one of the hallmarks of PM. The photographic classification and grading system for myopic maculopathy has already been determined. Conventionally optical coherence tomography (OCT) was commonly used in PM and enabled investigators to image deeper tissue such as choroid and sclera. Today, the technological advances in OCT imaging including ultra-widefield OCT and 3-dimensional construction of OCT have given clinicians a novel insight on variable morphology in the PM. "
MORPHOLOGICAL AND FUNCTIONAL CHARACTERISTICS AT THE ONSET OF EXUDATIVE CONVERSION IN AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION.,"Although goniotomy is known to be successful in treating congenital glaucoma, its effect in adult glaucoma patients remains unclear. To evaluate the efficacy and safety of goniotomy performed simultaneously with cataract surgery in treatment of open-angle glaucoma (OAG). Retrospective comparative study. A total of 76 patients with moderately controlled OAG (intraocular pressure [IOP]21mmHg using medications) undergoing cataract surgery. Comparison of patients who underwent the conventional goniotomy during cataract surgery (combined goniotomy group) with those who underwent cataract surgery alone (phaco group). Changes in IOP and medications, and complications through 12months. Baseline IOP was 18.22.4 mmHg in the combined goniotomy group and 17.41.9 mmHg in the phaco group; number of medications was 2.61.1 and 2.40.9, respectively (P>0.05). The reduction in IOP and medication use from baseline in the combined goniotomy group was significantly greater at 12months compared to the phaco group (-3.12.9 mmHg vs -1.32.4mmHg and -1.20.9 vs -0.70.9, respectively, both P<0.05). The success rate was 76.7% in the combined goniotomy group and 50.0% in the phaco group at 12months (P=0.021). No significant complication was observed in either group. Combined goniotomy and cataract surgery showed a significantly greater reduction in IOP and number of medications compared to cataract surgery alone at 1year after surgery, with similarly favourable safety profiles.

CORRELATION BETWEEN MACULAR MICROSTRUCTURES AND ANISEIKONIA AFTER IDIOPATHIC EPIRETINAL MEMBRANE REMOVAL.,"To evaluate the angle kappa and pupil barycentre configuration in patients with myopic tilted disc syndrome (TDS). Thirty-five eyes of 35 patients with TDS were included in the study. Thirty-five eyes of 35 age- and sex-matched healthy subjects were enrolled in the control group. All measurements were performed with the Lenstar LS 900. Angle kappa was calculated according to Pythagorean theorem using the x and y co-ordinates of the pupil centre. Pupil dx and pupil dy values (pupil dx: x co-ordinate of pupil centre relative to corneal apex, pupil dy: y co-ordinate of pupil centre relative to corneal apex) were used to evaluate the pupil barycentre configuration. Central corneal thickness, white to white (cornea diameter), pupil diameter, anterior chamber depth, lens thickness, and axial length were also measured. The calculated mean angle kappa distance was 0.270.15mm in the TDS group and 0.290.23mm in the control group (p=0.42). The mean pupil dx was -0.010.24mm in the TDS group and-0.170.14mm in the control group (p=0.006). The mean pupil dy was -0.020.13mm in the TDS group and-0.050.22mm in the control group (p=0.65). The pupil barycentre in TDS cases was statistically significantly closer to the corneal vertex on the horizontal plane compared to the control group. However, there was no statistically significant differences in terms of angle kappa and pupil dy values between the groups. According to our results, refractive surgery can be performed safely with respect to complications related to decentration of ablation zone and decentration of multifocal intraocular lenses in these groups of patients.

INVOLUTION OF NEOVASCULAR AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION AFTER ENDOPHTHALMITIS.,"Povidone-iodine is used as a cost-effective broad-spectrum antiseptic in the prophylaxis and treatment of certain ocular infections. In this study, the stability, ophthalmic irritation potential and antibacterial efficacy of an extemporaneous povidone-iodine preparation was determined using established ex vivo and in vitro assays. Extemporaneous iodine was prepared by simple dilution in normal saline. Preparation stability was evaluated by monitoring concentration and pH. Ocular safety was determined using the bovine cornea opacity and permeability assay. Efficacy was assessed by determining the minimum inhibitory and minimum bactericidal concentration of the preparation on Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Diluted povidone-iodine maintained its stability over the 28-day evaluation. The formulation caused mild ocular irritation at the lowest prepared concentration (0.5 per cent w/v), with irritation noticeably increased at higher concentrations. The preparation showed minimum bactericidal and inhibitory concentrations of 0.078 and 0.3 per cent w/v on S. aureus and P. aeruginosa, respectively. This study confirms the stability and broad-spectrum antibacterial efficacy of povidone-iodine, while addressing the ocular irritation potential of this chemical. "
SEGMENTAL DIFFUSE VASCULAR LEAKAGE: A FLUORESCEIN ANGIOGRAPHIC FINDING IN PATIENTS WITH VON HIPPEL-LINDAU DISEASE.,"The cornea is a highly transparent structure covering the anterior one-fifth of the eyeball. The suitability of post-mortem donor corneas for keratoplasty is currently qualitatively assessed. This makes inferences prone to bias and subjective variability. This study aimed to develop a simple, feasible and cost-effective method to quantify corneal transparency. An artificial anterior chamber was modified to provide a central transparent passage and a standardised pressure segment. All corneas graded 'fair' were included in this study. The corneoscleral buttons were mounted on the modified artificial anterior chamber. The mounted chamber was held in a horizontal position at a fixed distance from a white projection screen. The laser source was placed in alignment with an artificial anterior chamber so that it passed through the centre of the cornea. A camera mounted on a tripod stand was placed at a prefixed distance. An image of the scattered laser spot that formed after the laser passed through the mounted cornea on the screen was captured with a single digital camera and standardised settings. Image analysis was performed using ImageJ, an open platform for scientific image analysis. The average red pixel intensity, max intensity, and full-width half max were calculated. The average red intensity was 132.456.65 SD. The mean for max intensity was 51.13.78 SD and the full-width half max 787.784.7 SD. Laser quantification is a simple and cost-effective method of quantifying corneal transparency. The study lends proof to the principle involved. "
