Focal Ablative Therapy for Renal Cell Carcinoma in Transplant Allograft Kidneys.,"To evaluate outcomes after focal ablative therapy for renal cell carcinoma (RCC) in transplant allograft kidneys METHODS: After institutional review board approval, patients with a history of RCC in a transplanted allograft kidney who underwent focal ablative therapy were identified. Complete chart reviews were performed and the relevant data were extracted for cumulative analysis. Six patients were treated with focal ablative therapy for RCC in a transplanted allograft kidney at our institutional between 2010-2017. Masses were diagnosed at a median of 8 years (range 1 month-8 years) after transplantation. Median mass size was 3 cm. Three patients were treated with microwave ablation, one with percutaneous irreversible electroporation, one with laparoscopic cryoablation, and one with open cryoablation. Median follow up was 45 months (range 8-61 months). The median creatinine level was 1.65 before ablation and 1.58 one year after ablation. No patients required dialysis after ablation. No patients developed local recurrence during the follow up period. However, one patient developed lymph node metastases four years after ablation. Two patients died during follow up of other causes. At the time of death both patients had functioning grafts. Focal ablative therapies are a feasible, renal-sparing intervention for the management of RCC in renal allografts at intermediate-term follow up."
Cryotherapy for nodal metastasis in NSCLC with acquired resistance to immunotherapy.,"Novel approaches with checkpoint inhibitors in immunotherapy continue to be essential in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the low rate of primary response and the development of acquired resistance during the immunotherapy limit their long-term effectiveness. The underlying cause of acquired resistance is poorly understood; potential management strategies for patients with acquired resistance are even less clear. Here, we report the case of a 75-year-old female smoker with cough, fatigue, and weight loss that was found to have an 8.6cm right upper lobe lung lesion with local invasion, adenopathy, and a malignant pericardial effusion. This lesion was biopsied and identified to be cT3N3M1b squamous cell cancer of the lung without any recognizable PD-L1 expression on tumor cells. For her metastatic NSCLC, the patient underwent two lines of conventional chemotherapy before initiation of combination immunotherapy with an anti-PD-L1 and anti-CTLA-4 antibody. Though she initially achieved a response, she thereafter progressed and developed immunotherapy resistant lymph nodal metastasis. While cervical lymph nodes could be surgically removed, another metastasis in an aortocaval area required a more sensitive therapy like thermal ablation. The aortocaval node was partially treated with a single treatment of cryotherapy and demonstrated durable complete response. Cryotherapy for checkpoint immunotherapy resistant metastasis appears to be a safe and feasible treatment for treating metastatic disease in non-small cell lung cancer. The prospect of cryotherapy adjuvancy may enable local control of metastatic disease after initial response to immune checkpoint immunotherapy and may impact on overall outcomes."
Adjuvant MRI-guided percutaneous cryoablation treatment for aneurysmal bone cyst.,"Aneurysmal bone cysts are benign, expansile, lytic bone lesions that behave in a locally aggressive manner. Although radiography and computed tomography (CT) can detect the lesion, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is ideal for the demonstration of characteristic fluid-fluid levels, extent, and margins. Treatment typically consists of open surgical curettage with the addition of local adjuvants and bone grafting. Residual or recurring lesions may be treated using percutaneous cryoablation. Although CT guidance is often employed for image guidance, visualization and targeting of smaller clusters can be challenging in young children, secondary to the partially mineralized bone matrix in the immature skeleton. In such cases, the higher contrast resolution of interventional MRI affords direct visualization and targeting of small aneurysmal bone cysts, accurate monitoring of the extent of the growing ice ball beyond the lesion's margin, and avoidance of exposure to ionizing radiation. We report a case of a 5-year-old boy with recurrent or remaining aneurysmal bone cysts of the scapula after surgical excision and embolization, which were successfully treated using MRI-guided cryoablation."
Bladder filling to promote subperitoneal hydrodissection during percutaneous thermal ablation of parietal abdominal tumor.,"An increasing interest in percutaneous ablation of renal tumors has been caused by the increasing incidence of SRMs, the trend toward minimally invasive nephron-sparing treatments and the rapid development of local ablative technologies. In the era of shared decision making, patient preference for non-invasive treatments also leads to an increasing demand for image-guided ablation. Although some guidelines still reserve ablation for poor surgical candidates, indications may soon expand as evidence for the use of the two most validated local ablative techniques, cryoablation (CA) and radiofrequency ablation (RFA), is accumulating. Due to the collaboration between experts in the field in biomedical engineering, urologists, interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists, the improvements in ablation technologies have been evolving rapidly in the last decades, resulting in some new emerging types of ablations. A literature search was conducted to identify original research articles investigating the clinical outcomes of new emerging technologies, percutaneous MWA, percutaneous IRE and SABR, in patients with primary cT1 localized renal cell cancer. Due to the collaboration between experts in the field in biomedical engineering, urologists, interventional radiologists and radiation oncologists, the improvements in ablation technologies have been evolving rapidly in the last decades. New emerging technologies such as microwave ablation (MWA), irreversible electroporation (IRE) and stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) seem to be getting ready for prime time. This topical paper describes the new emerging technologies for cT1 localized renal cell cancer and investigates how they compare to CA and RFA."
Available ablation energies to treat cT1 renal cell cancer: emerging technologies.,"Significant incidental findings reported on computed tomography (CT) scans are common. This article describes a 72-year-old man evaluated for possible bowel obstruction in whom was found a 3.1-cm x 2.6-cm centrally located enhancing mass in the left kidney highly suspicious for renal cell carcinoma. Due to substantial medical comorbidities, the patient was deemed a poor surgical candidate for either partial or complete nephrectomy. Interventional radiology was consulted for a minimally invasive ablation procedure. The large size and central location of the tumor involving the renal collecting system initially precluded definitive percutaneous cryoablation. Intra-arterial embolization was used as neoadjuvant therapy to decrease tumor burden. Fluoroscopy-guided bland embolization was performed targeting the arterial supply of the mass until stagnation of flow was achieved. A subsequent two-month post-embolization follow-up CT scan showed a 30% reduction in tumor size. Shrinkage of the mass from a central to a more peripheral location allowed for a cryoablation approach that would avoid damage to the vulnerable collecting system. Cryoablation was performed, and intraoperative CT demonstrated complete coverage of the tumor by the ice ball with no damage to the renal collecting system. A follow-up CT scan four years later showed no residual malignancy at the ablation site."
Embolization-induced Renal Tumor Shrinkage Followed by Definitive Cryoablation.,"Benign bone tumors consist of a wide variety of neoplasms that do not metastasize but can still cause local complications. Historical management of these tumors has included surgical treatment for lesion resection and possible mechanical stabilization. Initial percutaneous ablation techniques were described for osteoid osteoma management. The successful experience from these resulted in further percutaneous image-guided techniques being attempted, and in other benign bone tumor types. In this article, we present the most common benign bone tumors and describe the available results for the percutaneous treatment of these lesions. "
Percutaneous Treatments of Benign Bone Tumors.,"The objective of our study was to determine the effective cryoablation zone when treating pulmonary tumors in vivo and to create pulmonary-specific ablation maps to guide clinical procedure planning. Ablation volume was measured retrospectively in human patients after pulmonary tumor cryoablation with a triple-freeze protocol. Single-probe ablations were performed with 17-, 14-, and 13-gauge cryoprobes; multiple-probe ablations were performed with two or three 17-gauge probes. Statistical comparisons of ablation volumes to manufacturer reference values were calculated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Comparisons of ablation sizes by the number of probes were evaluated by the Kruskal-Wallis test. Mean volume of in vivo lung ablation with a single 17-gauge cryoprobe measured 3.0 cm<sup>3</sup>, which is a statistically significant difference compared with the in vitro -20C isotherm volume of 22.6 cm<sup>3</sup> (p < 0.01). Mean ablation volume of larger 13- and 14-gauge cryoprobes were 4.3 and 1.8 cm<sup>3</sup>, respectively, both of which are smaller than the in vitro -20C isotherm volume. Mean cryoablation zone was not significantly affected by distance to the pleura (p = 0.54) or distance to a vessel (p = 0.55). Ablation volume was significantly increased (p < 0.01) with the use of multiple cryoprobes, at a rate of a 10.8-cm<sup>3</sup> increase per additional probe. The increased ablation zone size was more attributable to increased short-axis width (9.6-mm increase per probe) compared with long-axis length (5.6-mm increase per probe). The in vivo effective pulmonary cryoablation zone is significantly smaller than the manufacturer-published in vitro isotherm. Larger ablation margins in lung are best achieved by using multiple cryoprobes."
Pulmonary Cryoablation Zones: More Aggressive Ablation Is Warranted In Vivo.,"This report describes the technical aspects of trans-arterial embolization (TAE) of renal cell carcinoma prior to percutaneous ablation. All patients (n = 11) had a single renal mass (mean tumor diameter = 50.2 mm; range: 28-84 mm). Selective TAE was performed via the common femoral artery. Embolic materials included: particles alone (n = 4), coils alone (n = 1), particles + ethiodized oil (n = 2), particles + coils (n = 1), ethiodized oil + ethanol (n = 2), and particles + ethanol (n = 1). All embolizations were technically successful and no complications have been reported. After embolization, 10 patients underwent cryoablation while 1 patient underwent microwave ablation. Ablations were technically successful in 10 of the 11 patients. Only 3 minor complications were identified but none required treatment. No adverse effect on the patient's glomerular filtration rate was seen from the additional procedure (p = 0.84). TAE of renal cell carcinoma prior to percutaneous ablation is safe and technically-feasible."
"Trans-Arterial Embolization of Renal Cell Carcinoma prior to Percutaneous Ablation: Technical Aspects, Institutional Experience, and Brief Review of the Literature.","We aimed to assess the safety and effectiveness of transarterial embolization (TAE) prior to percutaneous cryoablation (PCA) in the management of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) compared with PCA alone using a propensity score matching analysis to minimize confounding factors. A retrospective review of all PCAs performed for renal masses identified 9 patients who underwent TAE prior to PCA. These patients were matched in a 2:1 ratio with patients who underwent PCA only using age, gender, and tumor size to create the propensity score model for matching. Other demographic, clinical, and outcomes data were collected. The TAE+PCA group included 5 males and 4 females with a mean age of 67.9 years and mean tumor diameter of 51.7 mm. The PCA only group included 11 males and 7 females with a mean age of 66.8 years and mean tumor diameter of 46.2 mm. No significant differences in these propensity score matched characteristics were identified. Further, the groups had no significant differences in tumor geometry (P = 0.831), R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry scores (P = 0.144), or comorbidity indices (P = 0.392). TAE was technically successful and without complication in all cases. PCA was technically successful in 8 of 9 patients in the TAE+PCA group and in 14 of 18 patients in the PCA only group (P = 0.483). No significant differences in the rate of complications (P = 0.483), change in eGFR (P = 0.691), or change in hematocrit (P = 0.152) were identified between the two groups. TAE of RCC prior to PCA is safe and technically feasible; however, no objective benefits over PCA alone were identified by propensity score matching analysis. Due to small sample size and limitations of the study, no definite conclusions should be drawn. Larger, prospective studies of this therapeutic approach are warranted."
Transarterial embolization of renal cell carcinoma as an adjunctive therapy prior to cryoablation: a propensity score matching analysis.,"Although rare, unintended thermal injury to organs surrounding the ablation zone can lead to severe complications. Over the past 15years, different protective methods have been developed to limit risk of complications, and expand indications to include more challenging lesions in various locations including liver, kidney, lung and bone. The most frequently used techniques include hydrodissection, carbodissection, balloon interposition and probe torqueing. In most cases, tumours can be physically separated from sensitive structures, reducing risk of thermal injury. Endoluminal cooling/warming is an alternative option for complex ablations close to the ureter or major bile ducts. Different techniques may be combined to achieve successful protection in locations with complex anatomy. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of available protective measures and discuss respective advantages/drawbacks."
Adjunctive Thermoprotection During Percutaneous Thermal Ablation Procedures: Review of Current Techniques.,"Recent introduction of multidetector-row computed tomography(MDCT) with more than 64 scanners enabled high-speed scanning in wide range of the body. Electrocardiogram (ECG) gated scanning and 4-dimensional imaging provides precise evaluation of cardiac and vascular diseases. Fine vascular structures such as the artery of Adamkiewicz can be visualized due to improved spatial and temporal resolution of CT and magnetic resonance imaging(MRI). Interventional radiology also plays important roles in combination with surgical treatment. Complicated vascular embolization before and after surgery can be performed more safely using current microcatheters with increased flexibility and trackability and various kinds of detachable coils. Chylothorax also come to be treated by interventional radiology. Transnodal lymphography can visualize lymphatic leak followed by thoracic duct embolization. Radiofrequency ablation and cryoablation for thoracic tumors, which is usually performed by real-time CT fluoroscopy, is expected to be officially approved. Newly developed techniques will further improve thoracic imaging diagnosis. Dual energy CT technology and new reconstruction technique can decrease the radiation dose without deteriorating image quality. Iodine imaging by dual energy CT can visualize vascular perfusion. Four-dimensional flow image of MRI can image vascular flow-dynamics without using contrast material."
[Imaging Diagnosis and Interventional Radiology for Thoracic Surgery].,"Percutaneous image-guided cryo- (CA) and radiofrequency- (RFA) ablations have been widely used in the treatment of painful bone metastases (BM). However, paucity of data is available for the performance of these treatments when used with a curative intent. The aim of this study is to investigate the local progression free-survival (LPFS) after radical percutaneous image-guided ablation of BM in oligometastatic patients, and to identify predictive factors associated with local tumor progression. This is a retrospective review of all patients who underwent percutaneous image-guided CA or RFA of BM with a radical intent between 2007 and 2018. Forty-six patients with a total of forty-nine BM underwent percutaneous image-guided CA (N=37; 75,5%) or RFA (N=12; 24,5%). Primary malignancies included thyroid (N=11, 22.5%), breast (N=21; 42.9%), lung (N=8; 16.3%) and other (N=9; 18,3%) cancers. Additional consolidation was performed after ablation in 20.4% cases (N=10). Mean follow-up was 34.122months. Local progression at the treated site was observed in 28.5% cases (N=14); 1- and 2-year LPFS was 76.8% and 71.7%, respectively. Size of BM (>2cm) predicted local tumor progression (p=.002). Percutaneous image-guided locoregional therapies used in the radical treatment of BM in oligometastatic patients demonstrate significant rates of LPFS providing the size of BM 2cm."
Percutaneous image-guided ablation of bone metastases: local tumor control in oligometastatic patients.,"To compare partial nephrectomy (PN), radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CRA) and microwave ablation (MWA) regarding oncologic, perioperative and functional outcomes. The MEDLINE, EMBASE and COCHRANE libraries were searched for studies comparing PN, RFA, CRA or MWA and reporting on any-cause or cancer-specific mortality, local recurrence, complications or renal function. Network meta-analyses were performed. Forty-seven studies with 24,077 patients were included. Patients receiving RFA, CRA or MWA were older and had more comorbidities compared with PN. All-cause mortality was higher for CRA and RFA compared with PN (incidence rate ratio IRR = 2.58, IRR = 2.58, p < 0.001, respectively). No significant differences in cancer-specific mortality were evident. Local recurrence was higher for CRA, RFA and MWA compared with PN (IRR = 4.13, IRR = 1.79, IRR = 2.52, p < 0.05 respectively). A decline in renal function was less pronounced after RFA versus PN, CRA and MWA (mean difference in GFR MD = 6.49; MD = 5.82; MD = 10.89, p < 0.05 respectively). Higher overall survival and local control of PN compared with ablative therapies did not translate into significantly better cancer-specific mortality. Most studies carried a high risk of bias by selecting younger and healthier patients for PN, which may drive superior survival and local control. Physicians should be aware of the lack of high-quality evidence and the potential benefits of ablative techniques for certain patients, including a superior complication profile and renal function preservation.  Patients selected for ablation of small renal masses are older and have more comorbidities compared with those undergoing partial nephrectomy.  Partial nephrectomy yields lower all-cause mortality, which is probably biased by patient selection and does not translate into prolonged cancer-free survival.  The decline of renal function is smallest after radiofrequency ablation for small renal masses."
Partial nephrectomy versus ablative techniques for small renal masses: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"We aimed to report approach, safety, technical success, and clinical outcomes of prone trans- radial access (PTRA) and demonstrate feasibility for procedures requiring simultaneous arterial intervention and prone percutaneous access. Fifteen patients underwent PTRA, seven females (47%) and eight males (53%), mean age of 55 years (range, 19-78 years). All patients underwent PTRA for combined transarterial and posterior-approach percutaneous interventions. Variables included sheath size (French, F), type of anesthesia, arterial intervention technical success, posterior-approach percutaneous intervention technical success, estimated blood loss (mL), fluoroscopy and procedure time, complications, and follow-up. Mean sheath size was 4 F (range, 4-6 F; SD = 0.5). Arterial interventions included transarterial embolization of renal (n=6), hepatic (n=2), and pelvic vessels (n=2), diagnostic arteriography (n=4), and embolization of an arteriovenous malformation (n=1). Posterior-approach intervention technical success was 100% (15/15). PTRA technical success was 100% (15/15). Posterior-approach percutaneous interventions included retroperitoneal (n=5) and pelvic (n=1) mass biopsies, nephrostomy tube placement (n=2), cryoablation of pelvic (n=2) and renal (n=1) masses, sclerotherapy of arteriovenous malformations (n=2), foreign body removal from the renal collecting system (n=2), ablation of a renal tumor (n=1), intracavitary injection of pulmonary mycetoma (n=1), and ablation and cementoplasty of a vertebral body tumor (n=1). The biopsies were diagnostic (6/6). There were no minor or major access-site complications. PTRA is a safe and feasible method for performing combined arterial and posterior approach percutaneous interventions without the need for repositioning."
"Prone transradial catheterization for combined single-session endovascular and percutaneous interventions: approach, technical success, safety, and outcomes in 15 patients.",Ice-ball fracture is a rare and often overlooked entity that may lead to intraprocedural hemorrhage after percutaneous cryoablation of renal masses. There is scant literature on ice-ball fractures associated with percutaneous renal cryoablation. Immediate recognition of the <i>lightning bolt</i> sign during intraprocedural computed tomography can help identify patients who may have developed this complication. 
"The ""Lightning bolt"" Sign on Computed Tomography during Percutaneous Renal Mass Cryoablation.","This prospective phase I trial was conducted to evaluate the safety of percutaneous cryoablation for osteoid osteoma (OO). Nine patients with OO (mean tumor size: 5.9 mm; tibia, n=5; femur, n=2; lumbar spine, n=2) were enrolled and treated with percutaneous cryoablation. The primary endpoint was the evaluation of the treatment safety as determined using step-by-step registration. The secondary endpoints were the incidence and grade of adverse events by CTCAE version 4.0, and the short-term efficacy of this treatment. Based on a decrease in the numerical rating scale (NRS) score, efficacy was classified as significantly effective (SE5 or reached 0-2), moderately effective (ME 2-4), or not effective (NE<2 or increase). Cryoablation procedures were completed in all patients. Major adverse events (grade 3) related to the procedure were not observed. Minor adverse events (grade2) were observed in 22-67%. The mean NRS score was 7 before treatment, 0.6 at 4-week, 0.1 at 6-month, and 0 at 1-year post-treatment. All procedures were classified as SE. Percutaneous cryoablation is a safe treatment for OO. Future phase II trials with large patient cohorts are warranted."
Percutaneous Cryoablation for the Management of Chronic Pain Secondary to Locally Recurrent Rectal Cancer with Bowel and Nerve Root Involvement.,"The purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate and categorize temporal changes in MRI appearances of the prostate in patients who underwent focal therapy with MRI follow-up. The Institutional Review Board approved this retrospective study and waived the requirement for informed consent. Thirty-seven patients (median age 61; 48-70years) with low-to-intermediate-risk, clinically organ-confined prostate cancer underwent focal ablation therapy from 2009 to 2014. Two radiologists reviewed post-treatment MRIs (n=76) and categorized imaging features blinded to the time interval between the focal therapy and the follow-up MRI. Inter-reader agreement was assessed (kappa) and generalized linear regression was used to examine associations between an imaging feature being present/absent and days between ablation and MRI. Inter-reader agreement on MRI features ranged from fair to substantial. Edema was found present at earlier times after ablation (median 16-25days compared to MRIs without edema, median 252-514days), as was rim enhancement of the ablation zone (18-22.5days vs. 409-593days), a hypointense rim around the ablation zone on T2-weighted images (53-57.5days vs. 279-409days) and the presence of an appreciable ablation cavity (48.5-60days vs. 613-798days, all p<0.05). Enhancement of the ablation zone/scar (553-731days vs. 61.5-162days) and the formation of a T2-hypointense scar were found to be present on later MRI scans (514-553days vs. 29-32days, one reader). The MRI appearance of the prostate after focal ablation changes substantially over time. Identification of temporal patterns in the appearance of imaging features should help reduce image interpretation variability and errors when assessing post-therapeutic scans."
Intramural Hydrodissection of an Adherent Bowel Loop during Renal Tumor Cryoablation: Complication or Thermoprotection?,"To evaluate the accuracy of robotic insertion of various ablation needles at various locations under computed tomography (CT) guidance in swine. The robot was used for CT-guided insertion of four ablation needles, namely a single internally cooled radiofrequency ablation (RFA) needle (Cool-tip), a multi-tined expandable RFA needle (LeVeen), a cryoablation needle (IceRod), and an internally cooled microwave ablation needle (Emprint). One author remotely operated the robot with the operation interface in order to orient and insert the needles under CT guidance. Five insertions of each type of ablation needle towards 1.0-mm targets in the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle were attempted on the plane of an axial CT image in six swine. Accuracy of needle insertion was evaluated as the three-dimensional length between the target centre and needle tip. The accuracy of needle insertion was compared according to the type of needle used and the location using one-way analysis of variance. The overall mean accuracy of all four needles in all four locations was 2.8mm. The mean accuracy of insertion of the Cool-tip needle, LeVeen needle, IceRod needle, and Emprint needle was 2.8mm, 3.1mm, 2.5mm, and 2.7mm, respectively. The mean accuracy of insertion into the liver, kidney, lung, and hip muscle was 2.7mm, 2.9mm, 2.9mm, and 2.5mm, respectively. There was no significant difference in insertion accuracy among the needles (P=.38) or the locations (P=.53). Robotic insertion of various ablation needles under CT guidance was accurate regardless of type of needle or location in swine."
Cryoablation of a Retroperitoneal Sarcoma Facilitates Hemostasis following Interventional Radiology-Performed Endovascular Aortic Repair.,"Although surgical resection with curative intent is the main therapy for both primary and metastatic lung tumors, about 80% of lung cancers cannot be removed by surgery. Because most patients with unresectable lung cancer only receive limited benefits from traditional radiotherapy and chemotherapy, many novel local treatment modalities have emerged including local ablation therapy. The Minimally Invasive Treatment of Lung Cancer Branch, Professional Committee of Minimally Invasive Treatment of Cancer of the Chinese Anti-Cancer Association and Committee on Tumor Ablations, Chinese College of Interventionalists have organized multidisciplinary experts to develop guidelines for this treatment modality. These guidelines aim at standardizing thermal ablation procedures, describing the indications for candidates, assessing outcomes, and preventing postablation complications."
Phase I clinical trial of percutaneous cryoablation for osteoid osteoma.,"To compare the clinical outcomes between radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and cryoablation for the treatment of clinical T1b (cT1b) renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The data of 46 patients [(39 men and 7 women, median age; 73years, range 39-87years)] were gathered from 3 institutions. RFA and cryoablation were performed on 23 patients each. The median number of ablation needle was 2 (range 1-4) and 4 (range 3-5, p<0.0001) in RFA and cryoablation, respectively. Technique efficacy defined as coverage of the tumor by ablative zone, adverse events, local tumor progression, and survival were compared between the RFA and cryoablation groups. The primary technique efficacy rate was significantly higher in the cryoablation group (96%, 22/23) than in the RFA group (65%, 15/23, P=0.02). There was no significant difference in the secondary technique efficacy rate after additional RFA and cryoablation [21/23 (91%) vs. 23/23 (100%); P=0.24]. The incidence of grade 3 or higher adverse events was similar between the 2 groups (P>0.99). There was no significant difference between local tumor progression rate after RFA and cryoablation [3/21 (14%) vs. 2/23 (9%); P=0.66]. The 5-year overall survival rates were comparable between RFA and cryoablation (78 vs. 82%; P=0.82). Other than primary technique efficacy, the clinical outcomes between RFA and cryoablation were similar in patients with cT1b RCC."
Temporal changes in MRI appearance of the prostate after focal ablation.,"The present report describes a case of cryotherapy ablation in a 35-year-old woman with a 1.5cm painful venous malformation (VM) in the right vastus lateralis muscle. After the patient had failed sclerotherapy, a single session of cryotherapy was performed that resulted in both technical and clinical success. At 8-month follow-up, there was no residual pain. The use of cryotherapy ablation for the treatment of an intramuscular VM has only been previously described on 1 occasion. Based on our results, cryotherapy is a promising therapy for fast and safe treatment for patients with venous vascular malformations."
Robotic Insertion of Various Ablation Needles Under Computed Tomography Guidance: Accuracy in Animal Experiments.,"Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed noncutaneous cancer and second leading cause of death in men. Many patients with clinically organ-confined prostate cancer undergo definitive treatment of the whole gland, including radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and cryosurgery. Active surveillance is a growing alternative option for patients with documented low-volume and low-grade prostate cancer. However, many patients are wanting a less morbid focal treatment alternative. With recent advances in software and hardware of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), multiparametric MRI of the prostate has been shown to improve the accuracy in detecting and characterizing clinically significant prostate cancer. Targeted biopsy is increasingly utilized to improve the yield of MR detected, clinically significant prostate cancer and to decrease in detection of indolent prostate cancer. MR-guided targeted biopsy techniques include cognitive MR fusion transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, in-bore transrectal targeted biopsy using robotic transrectal device, and in-bore direct MR-guided transperineal biopsy with a software based transperineal grid template. In addition, advances in MR-compatible thermal ablation technology allow accurate focal or regional delivery of thermal ablative energy to the biopsy-proved, MRI-detected tumor. MR-guided ablative treatment options include cryoablation, laser ablation, and high-intensity focused ultrasound with real-time or near simultaneous monitoring of the ablation zone. We present a contemporary review of MR-guided techniques for prostatic interventions. "
Expert consensus workshop report: Guidelines for thermal ablation of primary and metastatic lung tumors (2018 edition).,"Venous malformations are the most common type of congenital vascular malformation. The diagnosis and management of venous malformations may be challenging, as venous malformations may be located anywhere in the body and range from small and superficial to large and extensive lesions. There are many treatment options for venous malformations including systemic targeted drugs, open surgery, sclerotherapy, cryoablation, and laser photocoagulation. This article reviews the natural history, clinical evaluation, imaging diagnosis, and treatment modalities of venous malformations. "
Radiofrequency ablation versus cryoablation for T1b renal cell carcinoma: a multi-center study.,"The metastatic disease from thyroid cancer represents a complex clinical scenario, which mandates a case-based multi-disciplinary approach in tertiary referral centers. Direct localised treatments such as minimally invasive interventional radiology procedures can play a vital role in providing a timely palliative or curative treatment in accordance with the patients' clinical status. In this narrative review, we present the current status of interventional radiology treatments for the management of thyroid cancer distant metastases. "
A Venous Malformation in the Vastus Lateralis: Our Experience with Cryotherapy.,"The use of opioids to control cancer pain could be insufficient. Interventional techniques such as a cryoablation have emerged as alternatives to opioids. To summarize the current scientific evidence on the use of cryoablation to control cancer pain. A systematic search of the Scopus, PubMed, and Cochrane databases was performed. All articles published before December 31, 2015, whose title or abstract specified cancer pain control as the endpoint were selected. Articles without abstracts and all nonsystematic reviews were excluded. 22 articles were included: 1 randomized clinical trial (RCT), 2 non-RCTs, 1 ambispective study, 9 retrospective studies, 2 nonspecified cohort studies, 3 case series, and 4 case reports. 496 patients with 580 lesions were treated. Lung cancer was the most common primary tumor. 82.8% of the metastases were bone metastases, with or without soft tissue involvement. Cryoablation decreased mean pain scores by 62.5% at 24hours post-cryoablation, by 70% at 3months, and by 80.9% at 6months. Cryoablation was associated with a 44.2% improvement in quality of life after 4weeks and a 59.6% improvement at 8weeks. The need for opioids decreased by 75% at 24hours and by 61.7% at 3months. Cryoablation in combination with radiotherapy, vertebroplasty, or bisphosphonates appears to be better than cryoablation alone. Complications were highly variable among the studies, but no fatal complications were reported. Cryoablation is effective in controlling cancer pain without relevant side effects. However, more studies are needed to confirm these results."
MR-Guided Prostate Interventions.,"Recent studies have shown efficacy of nivolumab, a monoclonal antibody specific for an immunoregulatory protein termed programmed death 1 (PD-1), against metastatic renal cell carcinoma. PD-1 is a transmembrane protein expressed on T cells that suppresses activation upon binding to its ligands, which may be secreted paraneoplastically by various cancers. Inhibition of PD-1 signaling via nivolumab may sensitize tumor-specific T lymphocytes in the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Systemic elimination of micrometastases requires robust activation and proliferation of tumor antigen stimulated T cells. Cryoablation lyses tumor cell membranes but leaves intracellular tumor antigens intact for recognition by effectors systemically, while eliminating permissive T cell subtypes locally. This single case report describes CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation of a metastatic renal cell carcinoma with local administration of nivolumab to simultaneously debulk the primary tumor, sensitize effector T cells against tumor antigens, and augment the systemic immune response elicited against established metastases. One month follow up PET scan revealed decreased uptake in the two smaller metastatic bone lesions with the smallest lesion completely eliminated. The largest metastatic bone lesion was slightly decreased in size and exhibited slightly increased uptake. The patient's presenting complaint of hip pain was abrogated, allowing her to resume independent ambulation. CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is minimally invasive and preserves tumor antigens, which are subsequently presented to tumor-specific T cells; their differentiation into cytotoxic T cells may be guided and their proliferation may be augmented by local administration of immunostimulatory pharmacotherapy at the time of the procedure."
"Treatment of Venous Malformations: The Data, Where We Are, and How It Is Done.","Local ablative therapies have become an established treatment option in interventional oncology. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and microwave ablation (MWA) are a standard of care in the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Currently, there is an increasing interest in cryotherapy, one of the oldest ablation techniques. It has some unique characteristics with regard to technology and mechanism of action. A systematic literature search using the terms cryotherapy, cryosurgery and cryoablation was performed. Selected studies are presented dealing with the mechanism of action, cryobiology and clinical use of percutaneous, image-guided cryoablation. Recent developments and perspectives are presented. Cryotherapy is increasingly used and has been included in guidelines for selected tumor entities such as renal cell carcinoma. Cryo-immunotherapy and combination treatments are future areas of interest. Cryoabalation may be used in many indications. Its major advantages are its unique visualization and the anesthesiologic effects of cold. While there are only a few prospectively randomized trials, the existing data on the use of cryoablation is promising. Its use appears to be justified in selected tumors, oligometastatic patients and for palliative indications.   Interventionalists need to know about the unique characteristics and advantages of cryoablation..  Proper patient selection and optimal image guidance are essential for successful cryotherapy..  Cryoablation offers unique advantages such as anesthesiologic effects and characteristic imaging features..  The lack of prospective randomized trials is a key disadvantage of cryoablation..

Current role of interventional radiology in the management of visceral and bone metastases from thyroid cancer.,"The objective was to determine the ablation size of a single 15-min freeze and compare it with the conventional 10-min freeze-8-min thaw-10-min freeze protocol. Secondary objectives were to determine the ablation margin and to ascertain whether islands of viable tissue remain within the ablation zone. Five adult swine under general anesthesia were used. After surgical abdominal exposure, two ablations were performed in liver and two in kidney. One ablation utilized the 15-min and the second the 10-8-10-min protocol. At maximum ice-ball, tissue ink was infused via an angiographic catheter in hepatic or renal artery to stain the non-frozen tissue. Animals were euthanized and organs examined macro- and microscopically. Three histological regions were observed: (A) a viable/stained region representing the tissue outside the ice-ball, (B) a central necrotic area representing the ablated region within the ice-ball and (C) an unstained but viable margin representing the non-lethal margin within ice-ball. Ablation size did not vary with protocol but did for tissue type. Renal ablation was approximately 54cm with both protocols, whereas liver ablation was approximately 6.74.4cm. Ablation margin was measured at 1mm irrespective of ablation protocol or tissue. No islands of viable tissue were identified within the ablation zone. Fifteen-minute cryoablation yielded an ablation size and margin identical to that of the conventional 10-8-10-min protocol. Within the ablated region, cell death was uniform. The only difference was a larger cryoablation zone in hepatic tissue compared to renal tissue, likely attributable to differences in blood perfusion."
Efficacy of Cryoablation to Control Cancer Pain: A Systematic Review.,"To evaluate perioperative outcomes of thermal ablation with microwave (MW), radiofrequency (RF), and cryoablation for stage T1c renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A retrospective analysis of 384 patients (mean age, 71 y; range, 22-88 y) was performed between October 2006 and October 2016. Mean radius, exophytic/endophytic, nearness to collecting system or sinus, anterior/posterior, and location relative to polar lines; preoperative aspects and dimensions used for anatomic classification; and centrality index scores were 6.3, 7.9, and 2.7, respectively. Assessment of pre- and postablation serum blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and estimated glomerular filtration rate was performed to assess functional outcomes. Linear regression analyses were performed to compare sedation medication dosages among the three treatment cohorts. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to compare rates of residual disease and complications among treatment modalities. A total of 437 clinical stage T1N0M0 biopsy-proven RCCs measuring 1.2-6.9 cm were treated with computed tomography (CT)-guided MW ablation (n= 44; 10%), RF ablation (n= 347; 79%), or cryoablation (n= 46; 11%). There were no significant differences in patient demographic or tumor characteristics among cohorts. Complication rates and immediate renal function changes were similar among the three ablation modalities (P= .46 and P= .08, respectively). MW ablation was associated with significantly decreased ablation time (P < .05), procedural time (P < .05), and dosage of sedative medication (P < .05) compared with RF ablation and cryoablation. CT-guided percutaneous MW ablation is comparable to RF ablation or cryoablation for the treatment of stage T1N0M0 RCC with regard to treatment response and is associated with shorter treatment times and less sedation than RF ablation or cryoablation. In addition, the safety profile of CT-guided MW ablation is noninferior to those of RF ablation or cryoablation."
Percutaneous ablative cryoimmunotherapy for micrometastaic abscopal effect: No complications.,"Surgical partial nephrectomy is still considered as the ""gold standard"" for the definitive management of small malignant renal masses, whereas treatment with image-guided percutaneous ablation is still mainly reserved for those patients who cannot undergo nephron-sparing surgical resection due to advanced age, underlying comorbidities or compromised renal function. Nonetheless, the recent evidence that underlines the long-term oncological equipoise of percutaneous ablation methods with surgical resection in combination with the reduced complication rate and cost supports the use of an image-guided minimally invasive approach as a first-line treatment. The purpose of this review is to offer an overview of the most widely used percutaneous renal ablation treatments (radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation) with a focus on their main technical aspects and application techniques for curative ablation of small renal cell carcinoma (stage cT1a). The authors also provide a critical narrative of the relevant medical literature with an emphasis on outcomes of comparative effectiveness research, and appraise the percutaneous methods compared to surgery in the context of evidence-based practice and future research studies.  RCC is a common cancer and is increasingly detected incidentally at early stages.  There is long-term oncological equipoise of percutaneous ablation compared to surgical resection.  Large-scale trials are required to produce Level 1a evidence."
Current Technique and Application of Percutaneous Cryotherapy.,"To investigate the effects of pirfenidone (PFD) on post-cryoablation inflammation in a mouse model. In this IACUC-approved study, eighty Balb/c mice were randomly divided into four groups (20/group): sham+vehicle, sham+PFD, cryoablation+vehicle, and cryoablation+PFD. For cryoablation groups, a 20% freeze rate cryoablation (20s to less than -100C) was used to ablate normal muscle in the right flank. For sham groups, the cryoprobe was advanced into the flank and maintained for 20s without ablation. PFD or vehicle solution was intraperitoneally injected (5mg/kg) at days 0, 1, 2, 3, and then every other day until day 13 after cryoablation. Mice were euthanized at days 1, 3, 7, and 14. Blood samples were used for serum IL-6, IL-10, and TGF1 analysis using electrochemiluminescence and ELISA assays, respectively. Immunohistochemistry-stained ablated tissues were used to analyze macrophage infiltration and local TGF1 expression in the border region surrounding the cryoablation-induced coagulation zone. Cryoablation induced macrophage infiltration and increased TGF1 expression in the border of the necrotic zone, and high levels of serum IL-6, peaking at days 7 (70.58.46/HPF), 14 (22818.36/HPF), and 7 (298.6792.63), respectively. Animals receiving PFD showed reduced macrophage infiltration (35.516.93/HPF at day 7, p<0.01) and cytokine levels (60.27.6/HPF at day 14, p<0.01). PFD also significantly reduced serum IL-6 levels (p<0.001 vs. all non-PFD groups). PFD mitigates cryoablation induced muscle tissue macrophage infiltration, increased IL-6 levels, and local TGF1 expression in a small animal model."
Single 15-Min Protocol Yields the Same Cryoablation Size and Margin as the Conventional 10-8-10-Min Protocol: Results of Kidney and Liver Swine Experiment.,"In bone and soft tissue sarcomas (STS), surgery was to the only local curative treatment, but recently, radiation therapy and interventional radiology has evolved to potentially curative treatment, namely in small size tumours. Indication for local treatment in STS needs validation in multidisciplinary team. Most will agree on local treatment for single metastatic location in a well-controlled disease and for no local treatment in a rapidly evolving multi-metastatic disease. The challenge is in patients who are in between, for whom benefit of disease control on overall survival should be evaluated. Local treatment has been reported beneficial in some large retrospective series, regardless of the association with chemotherapy in selected patients with oligometastatic disease. Recent technical innovation in image guidance allows to deliver local treatment through needles inserted percutaneously, and image-guided thermal ablation of small tumour is now part of the treatment armamentarium in selected oligometastatic diseases, allowing for local destruction of small tumour. Radiofrequency ablation allows to control small size STS lung metastases in roughly 90% of attempts, thus providing an efficient and low-invasive local control with preservation of organ function. Small size bone deposit can be targeted with the same rate of efficacy when tumours are small. Ablation can be used in the liver when some tumour foci become resistant to systemic therapy, namely in gastrointestinal stromal tumour patients. In addition, interventional radiology can now provide efficient and rapid pain palliation as well as bone reconstruction with the use of cementoplasty and percutaneous osteosynthesis, alongside radiation therapy which has been a long time player for pain palliation in bone metastases."
"Thermal Ablation of T1c Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Comparative Assessment of Technical Performance, Procedural Outcome, and Safety of Microwave Ablation, Radiofrequency Ablation, and Cryoablation.","To evaluate the effectiveness of percutaneous image-guided thermal ablation in achieving local tumor control and pain palliation of sarcoma metastases within the musculoskeletal system. Retrospective review of 64 sarcoma metastases within the musculoskeletal system in 26 women and 15 men (total=41) treated with ablation between December 2011 and August 2016 was performed. Mean age of the cohort was 42.9years16.0years. Two subgroups were treated: oligometastatic disease (n=13) and widely metastatic disease (n=51). A variety of sarcoma histologies were treated with average tumor volume of 42.5cm<sup>3</sup> (range 0.1-484.7cm<sup>3</sup>). Pain scores were recorded before and 4weeks after therapy for 59% (38/64) of treated lesions. Follow-up imaging was evaluated for local control and to monitor sites of untreated disease as an internal control. Fifty-eight percent (37/64) were lost to imaging follow-up at varying time points over a year. Complication rate was 5% (3/64; one minor and two major events). One-year local tumor control rates were 70% (19/27) in all patients, 67% (12/18) in the setting of progression of untreated metastases, and 100% (10/10) in the setting of oligometastatic disease. Median pain scores decreased from 8 (interquartile range 5.0-9.0) to 3 (interquartile range 0.1-4.0) 1month after the procedure (P<0.001). Image-guided percutaneous ablation is an effective option for local tumor control and pain palliation of metastatic sarcomas within the musculoskeletal system. Treatment in the setting of oligometastatic disease offers potential for remission. Level 4, Retrospective Review."
Image-guided minimally invasive treatment for small renal cell carcinoma.,"To compare overall survival (OS) and liver cancer-specific survival (LCSS) in patients with localized hepatocellular carcinoma treated with surgical resection (SR) or thermal ablation (TA) using the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results database. Kaplan-Meier, competing risk and Cox regression analyses were performed after identifying patients. Propensity score matching was then applied. There was significantly better OS in the SR group and significantly lower probability of LCSS in the TA group. After matching, there was significantly longer OS in the SR group and a lower probability of LCSS in the TA group. SR offered a significant survival benefit over TA for localized hepatocellular carcinoma. "
Pirfenidone inhibits cryoablation induced local macrophage infiltration along with its associated TGFb1 expression and serum cytokine level in a mouse model.,"To determine size of ablation zone and pulmonary hemorrhage in double-freeze (DF) vs modified triple-freeze (mTF) cryoablation protocols with different probe sizes in porcine lung. In 10 healthy adult pigs, 20 pulmonary cryoablations were performed using either a 2.4-mm or a 1.7-mm probe. Either conventional DF or mTF protocol was used. Serial noncontrast CT scans were performed during ablations. Ablation iceball and hemorrhage volumes were measured and compared between protocols and probe sizes. With 1.7-mm probe, greater peak iceball volume was observed with DF compared with mTF, although difference was not statistically significant (16.1 mL  1.9 vs 8.8 mL  3.6, P= .07). With 2.4-mm probe, DF and mTF produced similar peak iceball volumes (14.0 mL  2.8 vs 14.6 mL  2.7, P= .88). Midcycle hemorrhage was significantly larger with DF with the 1.7-mm probe (94.3 mL  22.2 vs 19.6 mL  2.1, P= .02) and with both sizes combined (93.2 mL  17.5 vs. 50.9 mL  12.6, P= .048). Rate of hemorrhage increase was significantly higher in DF (10.4 mL/min vs 5.1 mL/min, P= .003). End-cycle hemorrhage was visibly larger in DF compared with mTF across probe sizes, although differences were not statistically significant (P = .14 for 1.7 mm probe, P = .18 for 2.4 mm probe, and P = .07 for both probes combined). Rate of increase in hemorrhage during the last thaw period was not statistically different between DF and mTF (3.0 mL/min vs 2.8 mL/min, P= .992). mTF reduced rate of midcycle hemorrhage compared with DF. With mTF, midcycle hemorrhage was significantly smaller with 1.7-mm probe; although noticeably smaller with 2.4-mm probe, statistical significance was not achieved. Iceball size was not significantly different across both protocols and probe types."
Interventional radiology: Role in the treatment of sarcomas.,"To describe the experience of our institution in image-guided renal nodules percutaneous cryoablation, evaluating demographic and technical aspects as well as efficacy, safety and follow up. Retrospective study approved by our institutional review board. Seventy-one renal tumors evaluated in 60 patients treated with image guided percutaneous renal cryoablation from January 2009 to December 2015. No patient was excluded from study, even those who were lost on follow up. All the procedures were guided both by ultrasound and tomography. An argon and helium based cryoablation machine was used for all treatments. Hydrodissection was performed when the bowel or ureters were within 1cm (iodinated contrast media in dextrose solution). Complications were assessed by the terminology criteria of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Patients were monitored and evaluated by ultrasound, tomography, MRI and/or PET-CT. In most procedures (91.9%) only one nodule was treated. Nodules had a median size of 1.6cm. Most nodules (61,9%) were exophytic. Hydrodissection and retrograde warm pyeloperfusion were performed in most procedures. Among all variables evaluated in univariate analysis, nearness of nodule to collecting system and anterior/posterior location were significantly associated with PRCA complications. No other factor evaluated was significantly associated with complications. PRCA is solid alternative to traditional surgical therapies for treatment of small renal tumors in wide subset of patients. Medium term evidence shows excellent long-term oncological results, similar to nephrectomy, with minimal risk of major complications."

Comparison of Double-Freeze versus Modified Triple-Freeze Pulmonary Cryoablation and Hemorrhage Volume Using Different Probe Sizes in an InVivo Porcine Lung.,"To test the hypothesis that, given the current resection eligibility criteria for colorectal liver metastasis (CLM), prior hepatectomy would be associated with improved local tumor control and survival after percutaneous ablation of CLMs. This single-institution retrospective study included 82 consecutive patients with 97 CLMs treated with ablation (radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, or cryoablation) from January 2005 to December 2014. Local tumor progression-free survival (LTPFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS) at any organ, and overall survival (OS) were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method from the time of ablation and compared between patients with (n= 49) and without (n= 33) prior hepatectomy. Cox regression models were used to identify LTPFS predictors. Median overall follow-up period was 28 months (range, 4.5-132 months). Three-year actuarial LTPFS (patient level: 73% vs 34%, P < .001) was significantly higher in patients with than without prior hepatectomy, respectively. Similarly, 3-year RFS (23% vs 9.1%, P= .026) and OS (78% vs 48%, P= .003) were improved in patients with prior hepatectomy. At multivariate analysis, predictors of worse LTPFS were: no prior hepatectomy (hazard ratio [HR] 2.35, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-5.45; P= .045), minimal ablation margin < 5 mm (HR 2.4, 95% CI 1.18-4.87; P= .016), and RAS-mutant tumor (HR 2.65, 95% CI 1.18-5.94; P= .019). Prior hepatectomy for CLMs is associated with improved local tumor control after percutaneous ablation of post-resection-developed CLMs."
"Image-guided percutaneous renal cryoablation: Five years experience, results and follow-up.","To investigate the midterm safety and efficacy of computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous gallbladder cryoablation in swine. Three swine underwent gallbladder cryoablation. Cryoprobes were positioned percutaneously at the gallbladder margins or within the gallbladder lumen under CT guidance. Two freeze/thaw cycles were performed. One animal was euthanized on postprocedure day 4 as a result of hematemesis unrelated to the ablation. The other 2 animals were euthanized at postprocedure days 30 and 48, respectively. The gallbladder and bile ducts were resected and examined microscopically. Gallbladder cryoablation was completed with freeze/thaw cycle durations of 7.5-10 minutes (mean, 9.4 min  1.3) and ablation margins of 5.8-11.5 mm (mean, 7.8 mm  1.9). No nontarget ablation was observed. Laboratory values at postprocedure day 4 and the time of euthanasia were within normal limits. Two of 3 animals thrived and exhibited appropriate activity and weight gain. Contrast-enhanced CT immediately before euthanasia demonstrated delayed linear enhancement of the gallbladder wall. Gross inspection at autopsy revealed fibrotic-appearing gallbladders. Cholecystography revealed no communication to the biliary tree. Histologic examination demonstrated complete gallbladder wall fibrosis. Autopsy of the animal euthanized on day 4 revealed a gastric mucosal ulcer distant from the ablation site with no gastric serosal injury. Gallbladder cryoablation is a promising alternative to surgical cholecystectomy, with complete transmural gallbladder wall fibrosis and cystic duct occlusion seen at 30 and 48 days in swine. Further studies are required to establish procedural safety and long-term efficacy."
Correction to: Epidural Balloon Placement for Protection of the Spinal Canal During Cryoablation of Paraspinal Lesions.,"Transbronchial cryobiopsies (TBCB) have recently been introduced as a promising and safer alternative to surgical lung biopsy in the diagnostic approach to diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLD). Despite a substantial and expanding body of literature, the technique has not yet been standardized and its place in the diagnostic algorithm of DPLD remains to be defined. In part, this reflects concerns over the diagnostic yield and safety of the procedure, together with the rapid spread of the technique without competency and safety standards; furthermore, there is a substantial procedural variability among centers and interventional pulmonologists. We report this expert statement proposed during the third international conference on ""Transbronchial Cryobiopsy in Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Disease"" (Ravenna, October 27-28, 2016), which formulates evidence- and expert-based suggestions on the indications, contraindications, patient selection, and procedural aspects of the procedure. The following 5 domains were reviewed: (1) what is the role of TBCB in the diagnostic evaluation of DPLD: patient selection; (2) pathological considerations; (3) contraindications and safety considerations; (4) how should TBCB be performed and in what procedural environment; and (5) who should perform TBCB. Finally, the existence of white paper recommendations may also reassure local hospital credentialing committees tasked with endorsing an adoption of the technique."
How to Perform a Routine Cryoablation Under MRI Guidance.,"Irreversible electroporation (IRE) has developed as a novel percutaneous ablative technique over the past decade and its utility in the treatment of primary and metastatic liver disease has progressed rapidly. Areas covered: After discussing the principles behind the technology and the practical steps in its use, this article offers a detailed analysis of the recent published work that evaluates its safety and efficacy. The strengths and weaknesses of other ablative techniques, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation and cryoablation, are discussed in detail. Other aspects of IRE, including post-treatment clinical follow-up, expected imaging findings, and the most frequently encountered complications, are covered. Finally, the future of IRE is examined as it pertains to advancements in the treatment of hepatic malignancy. Expert commentary: The characteristics of IRE that make this technology uniquely suited for the treatment of liver tumors have allowed it to gain a significant foothold in interventional oncology. Continued development of IRE will lead to further advances in the management of previously untreatable liver cancers. "
Impact of Prior Hepatectomy History on Local Tumor Progression after Percutaneous Ablation of Colorectal Liver Metastases.,"To evaluate the technical feasibility and efficacy of percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of osteoid osteoma (OO) in adults. 21 patients (12 male and nine female; mean age, 29.9 years) who underwent CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of OO were retrospectively evaluated. Procedures were carried out under local anaesthesia and conscious sedation in 13 patients, and under general anaesthesia in eight patients. Then, the ablation zone was evaluated with post-procedure magnetic resonance imaging at 6 weeks. Clinical outcome was assessed using a visual analogue scale (VAS) to evaluate severity of pain before procedure, as well as at primary (6 weeks) and secondary follow-up (6-40 months). All procedures were technically successful. Median VAS scores were: 8 (range, 5-10) before procedure and after procedure, respectively, 0 (range, 0-2; p < .0001) and 0 (range, 0-7; p < .0001) at primary and secondary follow-up. There were three minor complications (14.3%) and no major complication. A single patient reported symptom recurrence (4.8%) at secondary follow-up and successfully underwent a second cryoablation procedure. CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is safe and effective in the treatment of OO in adults, and can be accomplished without general anaesthesia in selected cases.  CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation of osteoid osteoma is safe and effective  Cryoablation allows precise visual control of the aggregated iceball during procedure  Percutaneous cryoablation can be accomplished without general anaesthesia in selected cases  Another advantage of cryoablation is reduction of immediate postprocedural pain  Post-procedure MRI is helpful in the evaluation of technical success."
Pilot Study of the Safety and Efficacy of Gallbladder Cryoablation in a Porcine Model: Midterm Results.,"To report a novel technique of ultrasound-guided injection of autologous blood in the interprostatorectal space, in an attempt to facilitate ablative prostatic procedures by widening durably the space between the rectum and the prostate. Between April and November 2016, four consecutive patients underwent the haemoprotection injection technique. For each patient, we recorded the time to perform the technique, the amount of injected blood, the achieved distances between the rectum and the prostate post-injection at fixed defined points (apex, middle, and base of prostate at the midline, left, and right sides of the gland), the extension of the ice ball outside the prostate capsule at those fixed points, and whether any residual blood was present on 1-month follow-up MRI. Mean time to perform haemoprotection injection was 54min, with an average blood volume of 103cc. Mean distance achieved at the apex, middle, and base of the prostate, respectively, was 12, 13, and 16mm in the midline; 8, 10, and 13mm on the left side; and 9, 10, and 13mm on the right side. The mean extension distance of the ice ball beyond the capsule was 4, 6, and 6mm in the midline; 4, 5, and 6mm on the left side; and 1, 3, and 3mm on the right side. No residual blood was present on 1-month follow-up MRI in all patients. No rectal fistula occurred. Haemoprotection may create a safe and effective virtual space between the prostate and rectum."
Transbronchial Cryobiopsies for the Diagnosis of Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Diseases: Expert Statement from the Cryobiopsy Working Group on Safety and Utility and a Call for Standardization of the Procedure.,"The aim of this article is to review the available evidence regarding image-guided percutaneous cryoneurolysis, with a focus on indications, technique, efficacy, and potential complications.

Technology of irreversible electroporation and review of its clinical data on liver cancers.,"Percutaneous image-guided ablation is an emerging minimally invasive therapy for patients with metastatic bone disease for whom radiation therapy is ineffective or contraindicated. The purpose of this study was to examine the safety and efficacy of percutaneous ablation in achieving pain palliation and local tumor control of osseous metastases from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A retrospective review was performed of 76 musculoskeletal metastases in 45 patients treated with percutaneous ablation. 63% (48/76) were treated with radiofrequency ablation (RFA), 35% (27/76) with cryoablation, and 1.3% (1/76) with microwave ablation (MWA). In 70% (53/76) of cases, associated cementoplasty was performed. Primary outcomes measured were pre- and post-procedure pain scores 4weeks after treatment and local tumor control at 3-, 6-, and 12-month follow-up. Mean age of the cohort was 63.69.5years. Median tumor diameter was 3.60cm (range 1.0-10.0cm). Mean and median pain scores before treatment were 7.52.3 and 8.0, respectively. Post-procedure, patients reported significantly decreased pain scores at 4weeks (mean, 3.73.5; median, 3.0; p<0.00001). Radiographic local tumor control rates were 83% (35/42) at 3months, 77% (23/30) at 6months, and 68% (17/25) at 12months after treatment. The overall complication rate was 2.6% (2/76). Percutaneous tumor ablation is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive procedure associated with improving pain palliation and achieving local tumor control of osseous metastases from NSCLC. Level 4, case series."
Percutaneous cryoablation for the treatment of osteoid osteoma in the adult population.,"Patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer might benefit by removal of the primary tumor. We report our experience with CT-guided cryoablation of the primary tumor, with the aim of evaluating its role in this subgroup of patients. Data of 35 patients with mean age of 58 years with breast cancer at stage IV submitted to CT-guided cryoablation of the primary tumor between 2010 and 2016 were prospectively evaluated. All patients, except three, were preoperatively and postoperatively evaluated with breast MRI to assess the extent of tumor necrosis. Retreatment was performed in case of incomplete ablation. Mean tumor size was 3.02  1.4cm. Six patients had multicentric disease. Complete tumor necrosis was 85.7% and 100% at 2-month and 6-month follow-up, respectively, as 5 patients with tumors > 3cm required a redo cryoablation. No patient developed major complications. Minor side effects occurred in 30 patients (82%). All patients were discharged the same day of the procedure. During a mean follow-up of 46 months (range 3-84), 7 patients (20%) experienced local recurrences that were treated with redo cryoablation, and 7 (20%) died for disease progression. Our results suggest that cryoablation of the primary tumor is safe and effective in the treatment of patients presenting with stage IV breast cancer."
Trans-rectal Ultrasound-Guided Autologous Blood Injection in the Interprostatorectal Space Prior to Percutaneous MRI-Guided Cryoablation of the Prostate.,"To prospectively evaluate the incidence of post-ablation syndrome (fever and flu-like symptoms) and impact on the quality of life in the first 10days following percutaneous image-guided cryoablation for renal cell carcinoma (RCC). A prospective study of all cryoablation procedures with biopsy proven RCC was conducted with institutional review board approval between 08/2012 and 04/2016. Sixty-four patients (43 males and 21 females) underwent cryoablation. Mean age was 68 (range 24-86). A telephone questionnaire survey was conducted on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 10 following cryoablation, and complications were recorded. Data collected included temperature, degree of flu-like symptoms, severity of pain, percentage of pain relief with analgesics, interference with general activity and with work (graded on a 0-10 Numeric Intensity Scale). Following cryoablation, six patients (9%) out of 64 developed post-ablation syndrome. Thirty-three patients (52%) developed flu-like symptoms only, which completely resolved by day 10 in 25 patients (39%). One patient had pyrexia only, which was self- limiting by day 10. Twenty-four patients (38%) were asymptomatic. Pain (mean score=2.1) and interference on general activities (mean score=1.8) and work (mean score=2) following cryoablation peaked on day 3 and improved subsequently. Forty-six patients (72%) had 90-100% pain relief by day 10. No major complications were observed. The full spectrum of post-ablation syndrome following cryoablation occurs in approximately 9% of patients; however, 61% of patients experience flu-like symptoms in the first 10days, which are self-limiting."
Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoneurolysis.,"Metastases to the bone are common in cancer patients, and it has been estimated that up to 50% of patients with pelvic bone metastases will not achieve adequate pain control with medications alone. This has led to a paradigm shift over recent years towards the use and development of minimally invasive image-guided treatment options for palliation of bony metastases. Despite these developments, large metastatic lesions are still often considered to be ""hopeless cases"" that would garner little to no benefit from image-guided intervention. This study is the first large series to describe the novel use of combination percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty for palliation of such large metastases to the pelvis. We aim to evaluate the efficacy and safety of image-guided percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty for palliation of large pelvic bone metastases. This retrospective analysis was approved by our institutional review board. This study was conducted from January 2013 to December 2016, where consecutive patients referred for pain management of large pelvic bone metastases underwent combination percutaneous cryoablation and cementoplasty. This study took place at a tertiary care center after patients were referred following formal review from a multidisciplinary conference, which was comprised of interventional radiologists, pain management and palliative care physicians, radiation and medical oncologists, and when available, anesthesiologists. Forty-eight patients (36 men and 12 women) with a mean cohort age of 77.5 years (range: 52 - 89 years) were referred from the multidisciplinary conference for palliation of pelvic bone metastases. The inclusion criteria included patients with metastases greater or equal to 5.0 cm and significant pain refractory to conventional pain management regimens. All of the patients were deemed not to be surgical candidates. Mean pain scores were collected at numerous time-points along with procedural technical success rates and complication rates. Combination cryoablation and cementoplasty was performed on 48 consecutively referred patients with a 100% technical success rate and no immediate complications. The pain levels demonstrated a significant decrease (P < 0.001) following intervention, with mean pain scores of 7.9 (range: 5 - 10) and 1.2 (range: 0 - 7) throughout the week prior to intervention and at 24 hours post-intervention, respectively. The post-intervention pain scores remained stable at 1 to 9 weeks follow-up (mean: 4.1 weeks). Three patents (6.3%) reported no change in pain following the intervention; however, no patients reported worsened pain. The limitations of this study include its retrospective nature and the length of follow-up, which was often restricted given the life expectancy of our patient cohort. Combination cryoablation and cementoplasty is a novel and efficacious treatment option for palliation of large pelvic bone metastases. Marked improvements in pain, as well as mobility and quality of life, are often attainable.

Percutaneous Image-Guided Ablation in the Treatment of Osseous Metastases from Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.,"Patients with bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma often are not surgical candidates and have a poor prognosis. There are limited data on the use of cryoablation as a locoregional therapy for bone metastases. Our objective was to assess the local tumor-control rate following cryoablation of bone metastases in the setting of renal cell carcinoma. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients with metastatic renal cell carcinoma who underwent cryoablation for bone metastases between 2007 and 2014. We excluded patients if the intent of treatment was for pain palliation only, if cryoablation was performed without an attempt for complete tumor control (cytoreduction), or if the patient had no further follow-up beyond the cryoablation procedure. We recorded patient demographics, procedural variables, and complications. Cross-sectional imaging and clinical follow-up were reviewed to determine disease recurrence. The median overall survival and recurrence-free survival were determined using the Kaplan-Meier method. Forty patients (30 male and 10 female) with 50 bone metastases were included for analysis. The mean patient age was 62 years (range, 47 to 82 years). The median follow-up was 35 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 22.7 to 74.4 months). Twenty-five (62.5%) of the 40 patients had oligometastatic disease, defined as 5 metastases at the time of ablation. The mean tumor size was 3.4  1.5 cm. Metastases in the pelvic region represented 68% of the treated tumors (34 of 50). The overall local tumor-control rate per lesion was 82% (41 of 50). Patients with oligometastatic disease experienced better local tumor control (96% [24 of 25]) compared with patients who had >5 metastases (53.3% [8 of 15]) (p = 0.001). The local tumor-control rate was better for lesions for which a larger mean difference between maximum ice-ball diameter and maximum lesion diameter was achieved (2.2  0.9 cm for those without recurrence versus 1.35  1.2 cm for those with recurrence; p = 0.005). There were 3 grade-3 complications and 1 grade-4 complication. Cryoablation can be effective for achieving local oncologic control in bone metastases from renal cell carcinoma and may represent a valuable alternative to surgical metastasectomy in select patients.

Cryoablation of Primary Breast Cancer in Patients with Metastatic Disease: Considerations Arising from a Single-Centre Data Analysis.,"A systematic review and meta-analysis of clinical trials was undertaken to compare percutaneous thermal ablation versus partial nephrectomy (PN) for stage T1 renal tumors. A comprehensive search of major databases was conducted from October 2000 to July 2016. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guidelines were followed. Incidences of all-cause mortality (ACM), cancer-specific mortality (CSM), local recurrence (LR), and metastases, as well as complication rates and changes in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), were evaluated. Inclusion criteria were met by 15 of 961 papers. These studies represented 3,974 patients who had undergone an ablative procedure (cryoablation or radiofrequency ablation; n= 1,455; 37%) or PN (n= 2,519; 63%). ACM and CSM rates were higher for ablation than for PN (hazard ratio [HR], 2.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.54-2.87 [P < .05]; HR, 3.84; 95% CI, 1.66-8.88 [P<.05], respectively). No statistically significant difference in LR rate or risk of metastasis was seen between ablation and PN (HR, 1.32; 95% CI, 0.79-2.22 [P= .22]; HR, 1.83; 95% CI, 0.67-5.01 [P= 0.23], respectively). Complication rates were lower for ablation than for PN (13% vs 17.6%; odds ratio, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.25-0.94; P < .05). A significantly greater decrease in eGFR was observed after PN (13.09 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>) vs ablation therapy (4.47 mL/min/1.73 m<sup>2</sup>). Thermal ablation showed no significant difference in LR or metastases compared with PN. Thermal ablation was associated with a lower morbidity rate and a lesser reduction in eGFR compared with PN, but with higher ACM and CSM rates."
Incidence of Post-ablation Syndrome Following Image-Guided Percutaneous Cryoablation of Renal Cell Carcinoma: A Prospective Study.,"Image-guided percutaneous, minimally invasive ablation techniques offer a wide variety of new modalities to treat tumors in some of the most medically complicated patients coming to our hospitals. The use of computed tomography, PET, ultrasound imaging, and MRI to guide radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation techniques now makes it possible to treat patients on a short stay or outpatient basis with very good immediate outcomes. This rapid expansion of new tumor ablation techniques often presents challenges for the non-operating room anesthesia team. Collaboration and communication between the radiologist and anesthesiologist are key to safety and excellent patient outcomes. "
The Hopeless Case? Palliative Cryoablation and Cementoplasty Procedures for Palliation of Large Pelvic Bone Metastases.,"Ablation of paraspinal lesions close to the spinal canal and neuroforamina requires protective measures in order to protect the spinal cord and nerve roots. Various methods of protection have been previously described including infusion of saline and CO<sub>2</sub>. Regardless, neuromonitoring should be adjunctively performed when ablating spinal lesions close to neuronal structures. Balloon protection has been previously described during ablation of renal masses. The benefit of balloon protection in paraspinal mass ablation is it physically displaces the nerve roots as opposed to CO<sub>2</sub> or saline which has the potential to insulate but because of its aerosolized or fluid nature may or may not provide definitive continuous protection throughout an ablation. This report details three paraspinal lesions, two of which were successfully ablated with the use of a balloon placed in the epidural space to provide protection to the spinal cord and nerve roots."
Cryoablation of Bone Metastases from Renal Cell Carcinoma for Local Tumor Control.,"To evaluate survival of patients with localized T1a clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) who received cryosurgery or thermal ablation compared to deferred therapy. We included 733 patients with histopathologically confirmed localized T1a ccRCC who either received cryosurgery (n=315) or thermal ablation (n=155), as well as patients who deferred therapy (n=263) from the 2000-2013 Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program urinary cancer file. Cox proportional hazard models were used to compare cancer-specific survival (CSS) across subgroups. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess potential unmeasured confounding by comorbidities. Patients treated with cryosurgery and thermal ablation had a statistically significant CSS benefit compared to those who deferred therapy (cryosurgery HR 0.25, 95% CI 0.14-0.45, p<0.001; thermal ablation HR 0.27, 95% CI 0.13-0.55, p<0.001, after adjustment for age at diagnosis, tumor grade, and size). There was no significant difference in CSS comparing cryosurgery to thermal ablation (HR 1.03, 95% CI 0.45-2.3, p=0.95, after adjustment for age at diagnosis, tumor grade, and size). These results proved robust upon sensitivity analyses: After adjustment for comorbidities with varying prevalence assumptions, the corrected hazard ratio (cHR) of cryosurgery versus deferred therapy ranged between HR 0.09 and 0.68. Local ablative techniques provide relevant survival benefit and are preferable alternatives over deferred therapy. Cryosurgery and thermal ablation yield comparable outcomes. 2b according to the Oxford Centre for evidence-based medicine levels of evidence."
"Partial Nephrectomy versus Thermal Ablation for Clinical Stage T1 Renal Masses: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of More than 3,900 Patients.","To retrospectively assess the safety and oncological efficacy of percutaneous image-guided cryoablation (CA) of T1b (>4cm/<7cm) renal tumors. Institutional electronic records were retrospectively reviewed to identify the patients who had undergone percutaneous CA of T1b renal tumors between 2008 and 2016. CA was proposed by a multidisciplinary tumor board for cases with poor renal function or a single kidney; unsuitable for surgical resection; or genetic syndromes predisposing to multiple hereditary renal tumors. Patients' demographics, procedural and follow-up data were accurately collected and analyzed. Twenty-seven consecutive patients (12 females, 15 males; mean age 72.314.3years) were included. Mean tumor diameter was 47.96.3mm. MRI guidance was used in 6/27 cases (22.2%) and CT guidance in the remaining 21/27 (77.8%) cases. Hydro- and/or carbo-dissections were necessary in 21/27 cases (77.8%). Complications gradedII were reported in three (11.1%) patients. Technical success and technical efficacy were 100 and 87.5%, respectively. Local tumor control (LTC) evaluated at imaging follow-up6months was 82.6, 72.3 and 60.3% at 12-, 24- and 36-month follow-up, respectively. One patient passed away 3months after CA due to the metastatic evolution of the primary kidney cancer. Percutaneous CA of T1b renal tumors is safe and satisfactory rates of LTC are expected at the early follow-ups. Further studies are needed to confirm the long-term efficacy of this procedure."
A Radiologist's View of Tumor Ablation in the Radiology Suite.,"Neuroendocrine malignancy is indolent, yet relentless in its propensity to metastasize to the liver, where it may cause bizarre paraneoplastic syndromes. The pathophysiologic mechanism behind this predilection for hepatic metastasis is twofold: the portal venous system drains the most likely primary sites for neuroendocrine tumors, and the relatively immunosuppressed environment within the hepatic parenchyma is permissive for tumor growth. The standard of care for patients with metastatic neuroendocrine tumor is surgical resection of at least 90% of the tumor burden. This report describes CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation of an inoperable mesenteric carcinoid tumor that had previously demonstrated hepatic metastases utilizing hydrodissection to safely and effectively prevent further metastasis while priming the immune system to eradicate this malignancy systemically. CT-guided percutaneous cryoablation is minimally invasive, has intrinsic analgesic properties, and may contribute to sensitization of the immune system against tumor antigens. Percutaneous cryoablation with hydrodissection can be used to target intraabdominal malignancy in poor surgical candidates. This procedure is safe, effective, and minimally invasive."
Epidural Balloon Placement for Protection of the Spinal Canal During Cryoablation of Paraspinal Lesions.,"Patients who develop prostate cancer after prior abdominal perineal resection are poor surgical candidates, and have limited treatment options. Therefore, our goal is to present results from a single institutional experience of four patients who underwent whole gland MRI-guided cryoablation with a history complicated by prior abdominoperineal resection. Four MRI-guided cryoablative treatments (mean age 64, range 59-69 years) for primary and locally recurrent prostate adenocarcinoma were retrospectively reviewed in patients with prior abdominal perineal resection for colorectal cancer (3) and juvenile polyposis (1). Average prostate volume prior to ablation was 23 cc, with an average PSA of 5.6 ng/mL. For each gland, 7-10 cryoprobes were placed approximately 0.5 cm apart in the prostate gland under MRI guidance by a transperineal approach with 3-4 freeze-thaw cycles performed. Each patient had follow up imaging and PSA measurements out to 12 months post ablation. All four patient's PSA dropped below 0.1 ng/mL at 3-6 month post-ablation and remained at these levels at 12 months. Three of the 4 patients had PSA measurements to 33 months post-ablation, with no evidence of recurrence. No patient developed urinary incontinence due to the whole gland cryoablation. With all four patients in our study having undetectable PSAs 12 months post ablation, and with no patient developing urinary incontinence due to the cryoablation, MRI-guided cryoablation appears to be a promising treatment option in patients who are poor surgical candidates due to prior pelvic surgery and/or radiation."
Treatment for Localized T1a Clear Cell Renal Cell Carcinoma: Survival Benefit for Cryosurgery and Thermal Ablation Compared to Deferred Therapy.,"The use of immunomodulation to treat malignancies has seen a recent explosion in interest. The therapeutic appeal of these treatments is far reaching, and many new applications continue to evolve. In particular, immune modulating drugs have the potential to enhance the systemic anticancer immune effects induced by locoregional thermal ablation. The immune responses induced by ablation monotherapy are well documented, but independently they tend to be incapable of evoking a robust antitumor response. By adding immunomodulators to traditional ablative techniques, several researchers have sought to amplify the induced immune response and trigger systemic antitumor activity. This paper summarizes the work done in animal models to investigate the immune effects induced by the combination of ablative therapy and immunomodulation. Combination therapy with radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and microwave ablation are all reviewed, and special attention has been paid to the addition of checkpoint blockades. "
Safety Considerations and Local Tumor Control Following Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation of T1b Renal Tumors.,"spine metastases are common concern from several primary neoplasms, modern management include percutaneous techniques such as ablation and cementoplasty. This research aims to evaluate the treatment under local anaesthesia in high-risk patients (ASA III). from January 2013 up to September 2016 we treated via percutaneous cryoablation 11 advanced oncological patients classified as ASA III, then retrospectively a review of their clinical history has been performed. Interventions were managed under local anaesthesia, injecting low doses of bupivacaine 2,5mg/ml (from10 to 30ml). Cryoprobes of 17G were introduced under CT guidance. VAS scores were evaluated pre, intra and post operative up to the 3rd month and further, statistical analyses were obtained using T student test. thirteen spinal metastases were cryoablated in 11 patients (6W, 5M; mean age of 53 years, range 52-81). Tumour location was: sacrum (n=6), lumbar spine (n=3), thoracic spine (n=2). The average VAS value during the procedure was 5,27 (standard deviation 0,90). There were statistically significant decreases in the median numeric VAS scale score at 1-week, 1-month, and 3-month time points (P<.001 for all). Technical success was achieved in all cases. Among patients with neurological deficit, some clinical improvement was assessed. cryoablation with or without subsequent cement injection can be safely performed with local anaesthesia for pain relief also in patients with high ASA score with higher risk of complications, in the absence of any other suitable treatment."
Freezing Fort Knox: Mesenteric Carcinoid Cryoablation.,"Here, we report our experience in treating painful plantar fibromas with percutaneous cryoablation. We retrospectively identified patients with symptomatic plantar fibromas who underwent percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation between June 2014 and June 2015. In total, four patients (two male, two female) with five plantar fibromas undergoing a total of seven ablation procedures were identified. Each procedure was performed under general anesthesia using a single freeze-thaw cycle. The electronic medical record, procedure reports, and pain scores from a brief pain inventory administered before and after treatment were reviewed. Average and worst pain in 24h, and time to peak symptom improvement post-procedure were compared. Complications were reviewed using the SIR classification. Five plantar fibromas were treated (mean size 2.21.6cm). Four of five lesions were present for more than 6years, and 1/5 was present for less than 1year. Surgical excision was previously performed on 3/5 lesions, all with short-term recurrence. Mean worst pain score in 24h and average pain score in 24h (scale of 10) at initial evaluation were 7.11.8 and 5.81.9, reduced after cryoablation to 0.80.8 and 0.40.6, respectively. Average time to symptom improvement was 2.80.98weeks (range 2-4weeks). All patients reported improved ambulation and weight-bearing, and complete cessation of pain medication after treatment. The improvement was sustained on follow-up at 12months. No major complications occurred. Minor complications occurred in 3/5 patients. Early experience with percutaneous ultrasound-guided cryoablation to treat painful plantar fibromas suggests that it is a safe and effective treatment option, with early and near-complete symptom improvement."
Whole-Gland Prostate Cancer Cryoablation with Magnetic Resonance Imaging Guidance: One-Year Follow-Up.,"Understanding and management of vascular anomalies has always been intriguing. These disorders exhibit an expected pattern of clinical presentation and progression, and characteristic imaging findings. Significant progress in understanding and treating patients with vascular anomalies has been made in the past quarter century. Newer multidisciplinary domains for treating these disorders with medical drugs and less invasive image-guided or surgical procedures are constantly evolving. Vascular anomalies can exhibit aggressive tumor-like behavior resulting in recurrence or persistent symptoms after treatment. Thermal ablation has been widely used in tumor treatment. This has generated interest on using thermal ablation for treating vascular anomalies. Percutaneous image-guided cryoablation is increasingly used for this purpose as compared with other ablation technologies. Availability of small caliber cryoprobes and the ability to monitor the freeze zone in real time have made this an attractive option to interventional radiologists. These experiences are relatively new and limited. It is helpful to understand the emerging role of this technology in the treatment of vascular anomalies. "
Immuno-thermal ablations - boosting the anticancer immune response.,"The purpose of this article is to report our intermediate to long-term outcomes with image-guided percutaneous hepatic tumor cryoablation and to evaluate its technical success, technique efficacy, local tumor progression, and adverse event rate. Between 1998 and 2014, 299 hepatic tumors (243 metastases and 56 primary tumors; mean diameter, 2.5 cm; median diameter, 2.2 cm; range, 0.3-7.8 cm) in 186 patients (95 women; mean age, 60.9 years; range, 29-88 years) underwent cryoablation during 236 procedures using CT (n = 126), MRI (n = 100), or PET/CT (n = 10) guidance. Technical success, technique efficacy at 3 months, local tumor progression (mean follow-up, 2.5 years; range, 2 months to 14.6 years), and adverse event rates were calculated. The technical success rate was 94.6% (279/295). The technique efficacy rate was 89.5% (231/258) and was greater for tumors smaller than 4 cm (93.4%; 213/228) than for larger tumors (60.0%; 18/30) (p < 0.0001). Local tumor progression occurred in 23.3% (60/258) of tumors and was significantly more common after the treatment of tumors 4 cm or larger (63.3%; 19/30) compared with smaller tumors (18.0%; 41/228) (p < 0.0001). Adverse events followed 33.8% (80/236) of procedures and were grade 3-5 in 10.6% (25/236) of cases. Grade 3 or greater adverse events more commonly followed the treatment of larger tumors (19.5%; 8/41) compared with smaller tumors (8.7%; 17/195) (p = 0.04). Image-guided percutaneous cryoablation of hepatic tumors is efficacious; however, tumors smaller than 4 cm are more likely to be treated successfully and without an adverse event."
Feasibility of percutaneous cryoablation of vertebral metastases under local anaesthesia in ASAIII patients.,"Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) is a novel technique that has proved to be useful in diagnosing various interstitial lung diseases (ILD). The use of TBLC to diagnose sarcoidosis in an unselected patient population is unknown, and could be complimentary to endobronchial ultrasound fine needle aspiration (EBUS-FNA). A retrospective analysis of 36 patients in a single, tertiary-care, academic medical center was conducted to describe the yield of both EBUS-FNA and TBLC in the diagnosis of suspected sarcoidosis over a three year period. A grading system to evaluate the presence and extent of specific radiographic features on computed tomography chest imaging studies was compared to the results of EBUS-FNA and TBLC. Complications associated with the procedures were also noted. The overall diagnostic yield in our cohort (all pathologic diagnosis considered) was 80.6% (29 out of 36 patients had a definite pathologic diagnosis). Eighteen patients referred for possible sarcoidosis had a positive bronchoscopic specimen confirming the diagnosis of sarcoidosis. For those patients with a pathologic diagnosis of sarcoidosis, the diagnostic yield for EBUS-FNA and TBLC was 66.7% each (12 out of 18 patients), while the combined diagnostic yield for EBUS-FNA and TBLC increased to 100%. For all cases, the pneumothorax rate was 11.1%. TBLC appears to be a safe and complimentary technique to diagnose sarcoidosis and could be considered part of the diagnostic armamentarium in bronchoscopic centers."
Percutaneous Ultrasound-Guided Cryoablation for Symptomatic Plantar Fibromas.,"To evaluate local control and survival after image-guided ablation of adrenal gland metastases. Image-guided ablations of adrenal metastases measuring < 5 cm performed at 2 academic medical centers between July 2002 and June 2016 were analyzed. There were 51 procedures performed on 46 tumors (mean diameter 2.8 cm  1.1; range, 0.7-4.9cm) in 38 patients (mean age 66 y; range, 41-80 y) with renal cell carcinoma (n= 17 patients; 45%), non-small cell lung cancer (n=10 patients; 26%), and other primary malignancies (n= 11 patients; 29%). Treatment modalities included cryoablation (n= 30 procedures; 59%), radiofrequency ablation (n= 12 procedures; 24%) and microwave ablation (n= 9 procedures; 18%). Technical success, primary and secondary efficacy, local progression rate, local progression-free survival, and overall survival were assessed. Mean follow-up was 37 months (range, 2-128 months). Statistical analysis was performed with univariate Cox hazards regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Technical success, primary efficacy, and secondary efficacy were 96%, 72%, and 76%. Local progression rate during all follow-up was 25%. Local tumor progression-free survival at 1, 3, and 5 years was 82%, 69%, and 55%. Overall survival at 1, 3, and 5years was 82%, 44%, and 34%. In 16 patients with isolated adrenal metastasis, median disease-free survival was 8 months; 4 patients had no evidence of disease during follow-up. Lung cancer was associated with decreased survival (hazard ratio 4.41, P= .002). Image-guided ablation can achieve local control for adrenal metastases < 5 cm."
Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation in Vascular Anomalies.,"Focal treatment with radiofrequency, microwave and cryoablation has been increasingly used for the treatment of tumors in patients who cannot undergo surgical resection and in select patients with early stage or oligometastatic disease. Each of these ablation modalities has a unique working principle and biophysics underlying the ablative effect, which largely determines the clinical indication for its application. Irreversible electroporation, a relatively new ablation technique with a predominantly nonthermal cell killing mechanism has emerged as an alternative treatment technique for tumors that are contraindicated for thermal ablation because of safety or efficacy considerations. Here, established thermal ablation techniques are compared with irreversible electroporation for treatment of tumors in the lung, liver, kidney and bone, and rationale is provided to guide selection of the most appropriate technique for each clinical setting.

Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryoablation of Hepatic Tumors: Single-Center Experience With Intermediate to Long-Term Outcomes.,"Interventional radiology has revolutionized the local management of bone tumours, offering new minimal invasive alternatives to surgery and radiotherapy. Its role has continuously increased over the past years for the treatment of benign tumors and also of some malignant ones, especially in palliative situations. The development of protective techniques and new ablative technologies, such as cryoablation, contributes to expand the role of the interventional radiologist to new fields of applications in musculoskeletal oncology. "
The complimentary role of transbronchial lung cryobiopsy and endobronchial ultrasound fine needle aspiration in the diagnosis of sarcoidosis.,"Cryoablation is one of treatment modalities for kidney cancer and is expected to induce strong local immune responses as well as systemic T-cell-mediated immune reactions that may lead to the regression of distant metastatic lesions. Thus, the characterization of T cell repertoire and immune environment in tumors before and after treatment should contribute to the better understanding of the cryoablation-induced anticancer immune responses. In this study, we collected tumor tissues from 22 kidney cancer patients, before cryoablation and at 3mo after cryoablation. In addition, blood samples were collected from 14 patients at the same time points. We applied a next generation sequencing approach to characterize T cell receptor  (TCRB) repertoires using RNAs isolated from tumor tissues and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. TCRB repertoire analysis revealed the expansion of certain T cell clones in tumor tissues by cryoablation. We also found that proportions of abundant TCRB clonotypes (defined as clonotypes with  1% frequency among total TCRB reads) were significantly increased in the post-cryoablation tissue samples than those of pre-cryoablation tumor samples. Some of these TCRB clonotypes were found to be increased in peripheral blood. Expression analysis of immune-related genes in the tissues of pre- and post-cryoablation showed significantly elevated transcriptional levels of <i>CD8<sup>+</sup></i> , <i>CD4<sup>+</sup></i> , Granzyme A (<i>GZMA</i>), and <i>CD11c</i> along with a high <i>CD8/FOXP3</i> ratio in the post-cryoablation tissue samples. Our findings revealed that cryoablation could induce strong immune reactions in tumors with oligoclonal expansion of antitumor T cells, which circulate systemically."
Local Control and Survival after Image-Guided Percutaneous Ablation ofAdrenalMetastases.,"Tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO) is a debilitating paraneoplastic condition caused by small phosphaturic mesenchymal tumors (PMTs) that secrete large amounts of the phosphate-regulating and vitamin D-regulating hormone, FGF23. Tumor removal results in cure. However, because of high perioperative comorbidity, either from tumor location or host factors, surgery is sometimes not an option. Tumor destruction via cryoablation may be an effective option for inoperable PMTs. Three subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of TIO were studied. All three underwent cryoablation of suspected PMTs rather than surgery due to significant medical comorbidities or challenging anatomical location. Subject 3 had tumor embolization 24 hours prior to cryoablation because of the size and hypervascularity of the tumor. The success of the tumor cryoablation was defined by normalization of serum phosphate and FGF23. Cryoablation resulted in a rapid decrease in plasma intact FGF23 by 24 hours postprocedure in all three subjects (0, 2, and 9pg/mL, respectively) with normalization of blood phosphate by postprocedure day 3. Three-day renal tubular reabsorption of phosphate increased to 76%, 94%, and 95.2%, respectively; 1, 25(OH)<sub>2</sub> vitamin D increased to 84, 138, and 196pg/ml, respectively. All three had dramatic clinical improvement in pain and weakness. Two subjects tolerated the procedure well with no complications; one had significant prolonged procedure-related localized pain. Although surgery remains the treatment of choice, cryoablation may be an effective, less invasive, and safe treatment for patients with difficult to remove tumors or who are poor surgical candidates.  2017 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research."
"Irreversible electroporation and thermal ablation of tumors in the liver, lung, kidney and bone: What are the differences?","Image-guided thermal ablation is a minimally invasive treatment option for patients with primary and secondary pulmonary malignancies. Modalities include radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Although no large randomized studies exist comparing ablation to surgery or radiotherapy, numerous studies have reported safety and efficacy for the treatment of both primary and metastatic disease in select patients. Future studies will refine patient selection, procedural technique, and assessment for local recurrence and will evaluate long-term survival. "
Expanding the borders: Image-guided procedures for the treatment of musculoskeletal tumors.,"Colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM) is one of the most difficult and key points in the treatment of colorectal cancer. Approximately 50% to 60% of patients diagnosed as colorectal cancer develops metastasis, and 80% to 90% of CRLM is unresectable. Surgical resection is the first-line treatment for CRLM, while it is only suitable for about 15% patients. Systemic chemotherapy can prolong the survival of CRLM patients, however, a part of CRLM patients are resistant to chemotherapy. With the development of technology and the update of clinical evidence, individual therapy with target drugs and multidisciplinary treatment (MDT) have became a tendency, and minimally invasive interventional therapy has gained more acceptance in the MDT mode of the treatment for CRLM. Basically, the interventional treatment for CRLM is divided into two groups: vascular intervention and local minimally invasive intervention. Vascular approaches encompass portal vein embolization (PVE), hepatic artery infusion chemotherapy (HAIC), transarterial chemoembo- lization (TACE), and transarterial radioembolization (TARE). Local minimally invasive intervention includes radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation(MWA), cryoablation (CRA), and irreversible electroporation (IRE). Thevefore intervention treatment is an important complement to the comprehensive therapy of CRLM."
Pulmonary Embolism after Percutaneous Cryoablation for Lung Cancer: A Case Report.,"Transbronchial lung cryobiopsy (TBLC) can be indicated in diffuse parenchymal lung diseases (DPLDs) when a confident noninvasive diagnosis cannot be made. The 2 most relevant complications of TBLC are bleeding and pneumothorax (PTX). The accuracy of chest ultrasonography (US) for the detection of PTX is higher when compared to chest X-ray (CXR) with reference to computed tomography (CT) scan as a gold standard. We evaluated the accuracy of chest US in detecting PTX after TBLC in patients with DPLDs. Patients underwent TBLC during rigid bronchoscopy in deep sedation. Cryobiopsy was performed with fluoroscopic guidance. Three hours later, patients underwent chest US and standard CXR. When there was no concordance between chest US and CXR, chest CT was required. Forty-three patients were enrolled into the study. Cryobiopsy was performed in the right lung in 36 (84%) patients. PTX was diagnosed in 10 (23%) patients by CXR. There was complete agreement between radiologists interpreting CXR (k = 1, 95% CI 1). Chest US was positive for PTX in 11 (25%) patients. There was complete agreement between pulmonologists interpreting chest US (k = 1, 95% CI 1). The prevalence of PTX diagnosed by concordance of CXR and chest US was 23% (10/43, 95% CI 11.8-38.7). The sensitivity and specificity of chest US were 90% (95% CI 55.5-99.7) and 94% (95% CI 79.8-99.3), respectively. Moreover, the positive and negative predictive values were 82% (95% CI 48-98) and 97% (95% CI 84-100), respectively. Chest US is a highly sensitive and specific diagnostic tool for the diagnosis of PTX after TBLC."
Bladder Protection with Continuous Infusion of Warmed Saline Solution to Facilitate CT-Guided Cryoablation of Prostate Cancer with Extracapsular and Bladder Invasion.,"Surgical resection of limited colorectal liver disease improves long-term survival and can be curative in a subset of selected cases. Image-guided percutaneous ablation therapies have emerged as safe and effective alternative options for selected patients with unresectable colorectal liver metastases (CLM) that can be ablated with margins. Ablation causes focal destruction of tissue and has increasingly been shown to provide durable eradication of tumors. A selective review of literature was conducted in PubMed, focusing on recent studies reporting on the safety, efficacy, and long-term outcomes of percutaneous ablation modalities in the treatment of CLM. The present work gives an overview of the different ablation techniques, their current clinical indications, and reported outcomes from most recently published studies. The 'test of time' concept for using ablation as a first local therapy is also described. There are several thermal ablative tools currently available, including radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation, and cryoablation. Most data to date originated from the application of RFA. Adjuvant thermal ablation in the treatment of oligometastatic colon cancer liver disease offers improved oncologic outcomes. The ideal CLM amenable to percutaneous ablation is a solitary tumor with the largest diameter up to 3 cm that can be completely ablated with a sufficient margin. 5-year overall survival rates up to 70% after ablation of unresectable CLM have been reported. Pathologic confirmation of complete tumor necrosis with margins over 5 mm provides best long-term local tumor control by thermal ablation. Current evidence suggests that percutaneous ablation as adjuvant to chemotherapy improves oncologic outcomes of patients with CLM. For small tumors that can be ablated completely with clear margins, percutaneous ablation may offer outcomes similar to those of surgery."
Characterization of the cryoablation-induced immune response in kidney cancer patients.,"To assess the feasibility of percutaneous magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-guided cryoablation of small renal masses (SRMs) in a 3-T environment and to evaluate intraprocedural imaging, procedural safety, and initial outcomes. The analysis included 9 patients (4 men; median age, 72 y; range, 70-82 y) with 9 SRMs (diameter, 12-30 mm). Lesions underwent biopsy, and cryoneedles were inserted under ultrasound guidance. Verification of needle positions and ice-ball monitoring were performed by T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination and T2-weighted half-Fourier acquired single-shot turbo spin-echo sequences. On image analysis, needle positioning was considered appropriate if the target lesion border was visible, the needle tip was inside the target lesion, and the ice ball was expected to cover the target lesion with a 5-mm margin. If these criteria could not be assessed, imaging was considered inadequate. Technical success was defined as tumor coverage with a 5-mm margin and no residual disease on 1-mo follow-up MR imaging. Median total procedure time was 170 min (range, 135-193 min). Intraoperative imaging allowed adequate needle visualization in 67% of acquired scans (4 of 7 T1-weighted and 6 of 8 T2-weighted). Appropriate positioning of two or three needles used for each procedure was confirmed in all cases on T1- or T2-weighted imaging. Ice-ball formation was adequately visualized in all patients. Technical success rate was 100%. No local recurrences were detected on follow-up imaging at a median of 12 mo (range, 3-22 mo). Percutaneous MR-guided cryoablation of SRMs in a 3-T MR imaging environment is safe and feasible, showing adequate intraoperative imaging capabilities with promising short-term clinical outcomes."
Multimodality Image-Guided Cryoablation for Inoperable Tumor-Induced Osteomalacia.,"Image-guided ablation is safe and effective for the treatment of both primary and metastatic tumors in the lung. This article reviews the three most commonly used ablative options: radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation. We describe the advantages of each ablation modality in the lung and how to choose the most appropriate ablation device based on patient and tumor characteristics. The optimal technique for lung ablation is discussed and technical tips for improving clinical outcome are described. "
The Role of Percutaneous Image-Guided Thermal Ablation for the Treatment of Pulmonary Malignancies.,"Renal cell carcinoma is a relatively common tumor, with an estimated 63,000 new cases being diagnosed in the United States in 2016. Surgery, be it with partial or total nephrectomy, is considered the mainstay of treatment for many patients. However, those patients with small renal masses, typically less than 3 to 4 cm in size who are deemed unsuitable for surgery, may be suitable for percutaneous thermal ablation. We review the various treatment modalities, including radiofrequency ablation, microwave ablation, and cryoablation; discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each method; and review the latest data concerning the performance of the various ablative modalities compared with each other, and compared with surgery."
[Interventional therapy of colorectal liver metastasis].,"This review article aims to provide an overview of image-guided ablation of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) since it was first introduced in 1998. This will cover the background and rationale behind its development; an overview of the evidence for current thermal technology, such as heat-based, e.g., radiofrequency ablation (RFA), microwave ablation (MWA), and cold-based energies, e.g., cryoablation used; and summarise the published evidence regarding its treatment efficacy and oncological outcome. In addition, it aims to provide an insight into the potential role of the new non-thermal ablative technology, e.g., irreversible electroporation (IRE)/Nanoknife in image-guided ablation of RCC, as well as areas of challenge that will require further research and clinical evaluation to ensure delivery of a quality patient-centred interventional oncology (IO) service in image-guided ablation of RCC."
Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of Pneumothorax after Transbronchial Lung Cryobiopsy in Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Diseases.,"To compare ablation boundary sharpness after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CA), microwave ablation (MWA) and irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation in normal swine liver and kidney. Percutaneous CT-guided RFA (n=5), CA (n=5), MWA (n=5) and IRE (n=5) were performed in the liver and kidney of four Yorkshire pigs. Parameters were chosen to produce ablations 2-3cm in diameter with a single ablation probe. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed 24h after ablation, and animals were killed. Treated organs were removed and processed for histologic analysis with hematoxylin and eosin, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Three readers independently analyzed CT, H&E and TUNEL stained images of the ablation boundary to delineate regions of (1) viable cells, (2) complete necrosis or (3) mixture of viable and necrotic cells which was defined as the transition zone (TZ). The width of TZ was compared across the techniques and organs. Ablations appeared as non-contrast-enhancing regions on CT with sharp transition to enhancing normal tissue. On TUNEL stained slides, the mean width (m) of the TZ after MWA was 319157 in liver and 26795 in kidney, which was significantly lower than RFA (811477 and 938429); CA (452222 and 700563); and IRE (1319682 and 1570962) (all p<0.01). No significant differences were observed between the organs. Under similar conditions, the width of the TZ at the ablation boundary varies significantly between different ablation techniques."
Thermal Ablation in the Management of Colorectal Cancer Patients with Oligometastatic Liver Disease.,"<b>Background</b>Image-guided thermal ablation can be used for the treatment of medically inoperable primary and metastatic lung cancer. These techniques are based on the heating up or freezing (cryoablation) of a volume of tissue around a percutaneous applicator that induces necrosis of the tumor. <b>Method</b>The English-language literature concerning thermal ablation of the lung was reviewed. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the most widely performed and investigated of these techniques. Microwave ablation (MWA) represents a relatively new alternative that shares the same indications and is conducted in a very similar fashion as RFA. It has been experimentally and clinically shown that MWA produces larger, more spherical ablation zones over shorter periods of time compared to RFA. Seven different MWA systems are available in Europe and the USA with significant differences in the size and shape of the produced ablation zones. <b>Results</b>The types of complications caused by MWA and their rates of occurrence are very similar to those caused by RFA. The local progression rates after MWA of lung malignancies vary between 0% and 34% and are similar to those in the RFA literature. <b>Conclusion</b>Despite technical improvements, the current generation of MWA systems has comparable clinical outcomes to those of RFA. <b>Key Points</b>  MWA is a safe technique that should be considered one ofthe treatment options for medically inoperable lung tumors.  As thermal ablations of lung tumors are becoming more frequent, radiologists should be acquainted with the post-ablation imaging characteristics.  Although MWA has some theoretical advantages over RFA, the clinical outcomes are similar. <b>Citation Format</b>  Vogl TJ, Nour-Eldin NA, Albrecht MH etal.

Percutaneous MR Imaging-Guided Cryoablation of Small Renal Masses in a 3-T Closed-Bore MR Imaging Environment: Initial Experience.,"Image-guided ablations are nowadays applied in the treatment of a wide group of diseases and in different organs and regions, and every day interventional radiologists have to face more difficult and unusual cases of tumour ablation. In the present case review, we report four difficult and unusual cases, reporting some tips and tricks for a successful image-guided treatment. "
Decision Making in Interventional Oncology: Ablative Options in the Lung.,"To evaluate the changes in T-cell balance in peripheral blood following percutaneous tumor ablation. Patients underwent thermal ablation including radiofrequency (n=9) and microwave ablation (n=5), or cryoablation (n=5). Target tumors were located in the lung (n=7), soft tissue (n=5), liver (n=4), and bone (n=3). Patient peripheral blood samples were collected before and within 14days after ablation. Peripheral blood populations of cytotoxic T-cells (CTL), type-1 (T<sub>h</sub>1) and type-2 helper T-cells (T<sub>h</sub>2), and regulatory T-cells (T<sub>reg</sub>) were measured using flow cytometry. Changes in CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 ratios before and after ablation therapy were compared using paired t-tests. Peripheral blood CTL population (27.52.1% to 30.22.5%, p<.03) and CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> ratios (18.83.7% to 21.63.6%, p<.05) increased significantly after ablation. Although a significant increase in CTL/T<sub>reg</sub> ratios was found after heat-based ablation (18.04.4% to 21.64.7%, p<.02), it remained unchanged after cryoablation (21.07.0% to 21.54.3%, p=.92). T<sub>h</sub>1/T<sub>h</sub>2 ratio (13.73.0% to 17.23.5%, p=.12) remained unchanged after ablation. Ablation therapy alters the T-cell balance by increasing the systemic CTL/T<sub>reg,</sub> ratio. Heat-based ablation might be a more effective approach than cryoablation to enhance systemic anti-tumor immunity."
Decision Making: Thermal Ablation Options for Small Renal Masses.,"The management of small renal masses has become an important public health topic. The increased use of cross-sectional imaging and ultrasound has led to a downward stage migration for the detection of small renal masses. Cancer-specific survival, however, has not reflected this trend accordingly. Although partial nephrectomy has been the mainstay of treatment of small renal masses less than 4cm, there is growing interest in ablative therapies, such as cryoablation and radiofrequency ablation, due to decreased morbidity. Oncologic outcomes are limited by methodology and length of follow-up, but short-term recurrence rates are low."
Image-guided ablation of renal cell carcinoma.,"This study aims to discuss MRI-guided cryoablation (CA) of in-transit (IT) metastases from melanoma and to retrospectively present our preliminary experience in such a specific field. Three female patients (mean age 55.6 years; range 39-64) were included, and eight IT metastases (mean size 12.4  6.5 mm, range: 5-25) were treated in three different sessions. Technical success was 100%; and mean procedural time 129.3  103 min. (range 42-243). Primary local tumour control was 100% at 1-, 6- and 12-month follow-up; and 87.5% at 18-month follow-up. Two complications were recorded (one minor and one major). MRI-guided CA is a novel therapy, which may be included in the armamentarium of local therapies of IT metastases."
"A Comparative Study of Ablation Boundary Sharpness After Percutaneous Radiofrequency, Cryo-, Microwave, and Irreversible Electroporation Ablation in Normal Swine Liver and Kidneys.","Neuropathy of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve may manifest as pain and paresthesia in the skin over the inferior buttocks, posterior thigh, and popliteal region. Current treatment options include physical and oral pain therapy, perineural injections, and surgical neurectomy. Perineural steroid injections may provide short-term pain relief; however, to our knowledge, there is currently no minimally invasive denervation procedure for sustained pain relief that could serve as an alternative to surgical neurectomy. Percutaneous cryoablation of nerves is a minimally invasive technique that induces a sustained nerve conduction block through temporary freezing of the neural layers. It can result in long-lasting pain relief, but has not been described for the treatment of neuropathy-mediated PFCN pain. We report a technique of MR-guided cryoablation of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve resulting in successful treatment of PFCN-mediated sitting pain. Cryoablation of the posterior femoral cutaneous nerve seems a promising, minimally invasive treatment option that deserves further investigation. "
Thermal Ablation of Lung Tumors: Focus on MicrowaveAblation.,"To determine if modified RENAL (mRENAL) score and its individual components have superior predictive value relative to the RENAL nephrometry score in prediction of complications and recurrence after percutaneous renal cryoablation. Primary masses treated with CT-guided percutaneous renal cryoablation between June 2007 and May 2016 were retrospectively reviewed. RENAL and mRENAL scores were used to stratify masses into low, medium, and high complexity tertiles. Complications were characterized by SIR criteria. Predictors of complications and local progression were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis. There were 95 renal cryoablation procedures in 86 patients. Of ablations, 89 had at least 1 follow-up imaging study, with median follow-up of 29 months. There were 11 (12.4%) complications, including 5 (6.5%) major complications. Mass complexity, as measured by mRENAL complexity tertile, was associated with increased risk of complications on multivariate analysis (P = .045). Endophytic location was the only individual ordinal component of the RENAL and mRENAL scores associated with complications (P = .021). Local progression occurred in 7 (8.3%) masses. Complexity as measured by either scoring system was not associated with local progression. Only diameter > 3 cm was associated with increased risk of local progression (hazard ratio = 9.9, 95% confidence interval = 2.1-45, P = .003). mRENAL score was predictive of complications and tumor size was predictive of recurrence. Use of mRENAL score for complications and tumor size for recurrence should allow for simpler risk stratification and more accurate patient counseling."
Unusual tumour ablations: report of difficult and interesting cases.,"Today, in addition to surgery, other local therapies are available for patients with small-size non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and oligometastatic disease from various cancers. Local therapies include stereotactic ablation radiotherapy (SABR) and thermal ablative therapies through percutaneously inserted applicators. Although radiofrequency ablation (RFA) has been explored in series with several hundreds of patients with pulmonary tumours, investigation of the potential of other ablation technologies including microwave ablation, cryoablation, and irreversible electroporation is ongoing. There are no randomised studies available to compare surgery, SABR, and thermal ablation. In small-size lung metastases, RFA seems to produce results very close to surgical series with >90% local control and 5-year overall survival of 50%. In primary lung cancer, the technique is reserved for non-surgical candidates. In future, the low invasiveness of thermal ablative therapies will allow for a combination of ablation and systemic therapies in order to improve the outcomes of ablation alone. Another major advantage of thermal ablation is the possibility to treat several metastases in close proximity to one another and retreatment in the same location in case of failure, which is not possible with SABR."
Percutaneous Image-Guided Cryotherapy for Local Control of Recurrent Plexiform Schwannoma in a 3-Year-Old Male.,"The purpose of this article is to analyze longitudinal trends in locoregional therapy (LRT) use and review locoregional therapy's role in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma prior to orthotropic liver transplantation Porrett et al. (2006) . LRT has a role in both bridge to transplantation and downstaging of patients not initially meeting Milan or UCSF Criteria. Due to the lack of randomized controlled trials, no specific bridging LRT modality is recommended over another for treating patients on the waiting list, however each modality has unique and patient-specific advantages. Pre-transplant LRT use in the United States has increased dramatically over the last two decades with more than 50% of the currently listed patients receiving LRT Freeman et al. (2008) . Despite these national trends, significant differences in LRT utilization, referral patterns, recurrence rates and survival have been observed among UNOS regions, socioeconomic levels and races. The use of LRT as a biologic selection tool based on response to treatment has shown promising results in its ability to predict successful post-transplant outcomes."
Changes in peripheral blood T-cell balance after percutaneous tumor ablation.,"Painful osseous metastases are a common problem in patients with malignancy, and they can be associated with significant morbidity owing to immobility, pain, pathologic fracture, or neurovascular compromise or all of these. We retrospectively evaluated pain levels and tumor enhancement in patients who underwent palliative percutaneous cryoablation for painful bone metastasis. In this institutional review board-approved, health insurance portability and accountability act-compliant study, we retrospectively searched our departments picture archiving system for patients who underwent computed tomography (CT)-guided percutaneous cryoablation for treatment of painful metastatic osseous disease over a 6-year period (1/1/2005-12/31/2011). The preprocedure and postprocedure images and imaging reports, primary tumor type, CT-guided cryoablation procedure details, treated tumor response, immediate and 3-month postprocedure complications, reported pain response to cryoablation, postprocedural tumor imaging characteristics, and imaging response of noncryoablated systemically treated metastatic lesions were reviewed in patients with metastatic osseous disease who underwent cryoablation. All 16 patients reported improvement in pain within 1 week after the procedure and at 3-month clinical follow-up. A total of 6.2% had tumor growth and 93.8% had tumor arrest or shrinkage on follow-up CT, although all study patients had progression of noncryoablated metastases at other sites despite systemic therapy. A total of 62.5% of patients with posttreatment contrasted CT demonstrated marginal enhancement at the ablation site, although only single patient had interval growth. Most of our patients had tumor arrest or shrinkage on follow-up imaging, despite progression of noncryoablated metastases treated with preprocedure and postprocedure systemic therapy. Radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and analgesics have a moderate failure rate and require repeat treatments where quality of life is the foremost objective. CT-guided cryoablation is a safe palliative treatment to reduce pain in patients with painful osseous metastatic disease, achieve effective local tumor control, and in some cases, provide a curative option for a target lesion."
Ablative Therapy for Small Renal Masses.,"The purpose of this review was to identify the specific technical considerations to adequately perform microwave ablations (MWA) of renal tumors and analyze the currently available clinical results. Using Medline, a systematic review was performed including articles published between January2000 and September2016. English language original articles, reviews and editorials were selected based on their clinical relevance. MWA has several theoretical advantages over radiofrequency ablation in consistently providing higher intratumoral temperatures. MWA is less dependent of electrical conductivities of tissues and the delivered energy is less limited by desiccation of heated tissues. While there are insufficient data, especially because of a lack of studies with mid- to long-term follow-up, to determine the oncologic effectiveness of MWA, this technique appears safe and effective for the ablation of T1 renal tumors. There is evidence for using mid-level settings based on experimental and clinical data. Power set at 50-65W for 5-15min appears adequate in kidney but close clinical and imaging follow-up have to be performed. Renal MWA offers theoretical advantages by comparison with other available techniques to treat renal tumors. However, MWA suffers of less cumulative data compared to radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation. Moreover, microwaves still require further studies to identify the optimal tumor characteristics and device settings leading to predictable ablation."
MRI-Guided Cryoablation of In-Transit Metastases from Cutaneous Melanoma: A Brief Report on a Preliminary Experience.,We describe the management of a complication (a lumbar artery pseudoaneurysm and its rupture) after combined procedure (cryoablation and vertebroplasty) on a lumbar (L2) metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. Review of the literature is also presented with discussion about the measures to be taken to prevent these types of complications.
CT-Guided Cryoablation of a Substernal Mediastinal Ectopic Parathyroid Adenoma.,"To determine safety and early-term efficacy of CT-guided cryoablation for treatment of recurrent mesothelioma and assess risk factors for local recurrence. During the period 2008-2012, 24 patients underwent 110 cryoablations for recurrent mesothelioma tumors in 89 sessions. Median patient age was 69 years (range, 48-82 y). Median tumor size was 30 mm (range, 9-113 mm). Complications were graded using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0 (CTCAE v4.0). Recurrence was diagnosed on CT or positron emission tomography/CT by increasing size, nodular enhancement, or hypermetabolic activity and analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cox proportional hazards model was used to determine covariates associated with local tumor recurrence. Median duration of follow-up was 14.5 months. Complications occurred in 8 of 110 cryoablations (7.3%). All but 1 complication were graded CTCAE v4.0 1 or 2. No procedure-related deaths occurred. Freedom from local recurrence was observed in 100% of cases at 30 days, 92.5% at 6 months, 90.8% at 1 year, 87.3% at 2 years, and 73.7% at 3 years. Tumor recurrence was diagnosed 4.5-24.5 months after cryoablation (mean 5.7 months). Risk of tumor recurrence was associated with a smaller ablative margin from the edge of tumor to iceball ablation margin (multivariate hazard ratio 0.68, CI 0.48-0.95, P = .024). CT-guided cryoablation is safe for local control of recurrent mesothelioma, with a low rate of complications and promising early-term efficacy. A smaller ablative margin may predispose to tumor recurrence."
