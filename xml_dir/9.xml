<field name="content">Transarterial embolization of renal cell carcinoma as an adjunctive therapy prior to cryoablation: a propensity score matching analysis.,"Although rare, unintended thermal injury to organs surrounding the ablation zone can lead to severe complications. Over the past 15years, different protective methods have been developed to limit risk of complications, and expand indications to include more challenging lesions in various locations including liver, kidney, lung and bone. The most frequently used techniques include hydrodissection, carbodissection, balloon interposition and probe torqueing. In most cases, tumours can be physically separated from sensitive structures, reducing risk of thermal injury. Endoluminal cooling/warming is an alternative option for complex ablations close to the ureter or major bile ducts. Different techniques may be combined to achieve successful protection in locations with complex anatomy. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of available protective measures and discuss respective advantages/drawbacks."
