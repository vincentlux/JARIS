<field name="content">Ultrasonography for the Diagnosis of Pneumothorax after Transbronchial Lung Cryobiopsy in Diffuse Parenchymal Lung Diseases.,"To compare ablation boundary sharpness after percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA), cryoablation (CA), microwave ablation (MWA) and irreversible electroporation (IRE) ablation in normal swine liver and kidney. Percutaneous CT-guided RFA (n=5), CA (n=5), MWA (n=5) and IRE (n=5) were performed in the liver and kidney of four Yorkshire pigs. Parameters were chosen to produce ablations 2-3cm in diameter with a single ablation probe. Contrast-enhanced CT imaging was performed 24h after ablation, and animals were killed. Treated organs were removed and processed for histologic analysis with hematoxylin and eosin, and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL). Three readers independently analyzed CT, H&E and TUNEL stained images of the ablation boundary to delineate regions of (1) viable cells, (2) complete necrosis or (3) mixture of viable and necrotic cells which was defined as the transition zone (TZ). The width of TZ was compared across the techniques and organs. Ablations appeared as non-contrast-enhancing regions on CT with sharp transition to enhancing normal tissue. On TUNEL stained slides, the mean width (m) of the TZ after MWA was 319157 in liver and 26795 in kidney, which was significantly lower than RFA (811477 and 938429); CA (452222 and 700563); and IRE (1319682 and 1570962) (all p<0.01). No significant differences were observed between the organs. Under similar conditions, the width of the TZ at the ablation boundary varies significantly between different ablation techniques."
