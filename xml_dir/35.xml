<field name="content">Interventional radiology: Role in the treatment of sarcomas.,"To describe the experience of our institution in image-guided renal nodules percutaneous cryoablation, evaluating demographic and technical aspects as well as efficacy, safety and follow up. Retrospective study approved by our institutional review board. Seventy-one renal tumors evaluated in 60 patients treated with image guided percutaneous renal cryoablation from January 2009 to December 2015. No patient was excluded from study, even those who were lost on follow up. All the procedures were guided both by ultrasound and tomography. An argon and helium based cryoablation machine was used for all treatments. Hydrodissection was performed when the bowel or ureters were within 1cm (iodinated contrast media in dextrose solution). Complications were assessed by the terminology criteria of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Patients were monitored and evaluated by ultrasound, tomography, MRI and/or PET-CT. In most procedures (91.9%) only one nodule was treated. Nodules had a median size of 1.6cm. Most nodules (61,9%) were exophytic. Hydrodissection and retrograde warm pyeloperfusion were performed in most procedures. Among all variables evaluated in univariate analysis, nearness of nodule to collecting system and anterior/posterior location were significantly associated with PRCA complications. No other factor evaluated was significantly associated with complications. PRCA is solid alternative to traditional surgical therapies for treatment of small renal tumors in wide subset of patients. Medium term evidence shows excellent long-term oncological results, similar to nephrectomy, with minimal risk of major complications."
